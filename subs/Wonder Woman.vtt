00:48.842 --> 00:51.428
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

00:53.012 --> 00:55.223
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

00:57.100 --> 00:59.102
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

01:01.354 --> 01:03.773
<i>It is a land of magic and wonder.</i>

01:04.691 --> 01:07.318
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

01:09.612 --> 01:11.448
<i>But the closer you get,</i>

01:12.699 --> 01:16.286
<i>the more you see the great darkness
simmering within.</i>

01:20.707 --> 01:23.251
<i>And mankind?</i>

01:24.294 --> 01:26.921
<i>Mankind is another story altogether.</i>

01:29.257 --> 01:34.179
<i>What one does when faced with the truth
is more difficult than you think.</i>

01:44.439 --> 01:46.191
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

01:47.484 --> 01:49.319
<i>A long, long time ago.</i>

01:52.197 --> 01:53.198
<i>And now,</i>

01:56.034 --> 01:57.702
<i>I will never be the same.</i>

02:05.376 --> 02:06.377
<i>Merci.</i>

02:53.299 --> 02:54.592
Hello, Diana.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.511
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.471
<i>Diana!</i>

02:59.514 --> 03:00.974
Diana!

03:01.558 --> 03:02.559
<i>Come back!</i>

03:42.307 --> 03:43.808
- It looks very good.
- Very good.

03:43.975 --> 03:44.976
How is she doing?

03:45.143 --> 03:46.144
She's good.

03:46.311 --> 03:47.645
- Keep working with her.
- I will.

03:48.855 --> 03:49.856
Naomi.

04:12.337 --> 04:13.379
Diana!

04:15.006 --> 04:16.341
Diana, I see you.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.724
Where are you going?
Slow down!

04:34.859 --> 04:36.861
Hello, Mother.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.863
How are you today?

04:40.365 --> 04:42.909
<i>Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits.</i>

04:43.076 --> 04:46.621
But don't you think
it's time to start my training?

04:47.205 --> 04:49.040
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.042
Does she?

04:51.960 --> 04:54.379
I could begin showing her some things.

04:56.214 --> 04:58.383
She should at least
be able to defend herself.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.592
From whom?

04:59.759 --> 05:01.719
In the event of an invasion.

05:01.886 --> 05:05.223
<i>Isn't that why I have
the greatest warrior in our history</i>

05:05.390 --> 05:07.725
leading an entire army, General?

05:08.893 --> 05:11.813
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

05:11.980 --> 05:15.066
But you know,
a scorpion must sting,

05:15.233 --> 05:17.819
<i>- a wolf must hunt—</i>
- She is a child.

05:17.986 --> 05:19.986
<i>The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.</i>

05:20.113 --> 05:21.114
<i>But, Mother...</i>

05:21.280 --> 05:22.824
There will be no training.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.208
<i>What if I promised to be careful?</i>

05:33.334 --> 05:34.919
It's time to sleep.

05:36.713 --> 05:39.007
What if I didn't use a sword?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.843
Fighting does not make you a hero.

05:42.427 --> 05:44.762
Just a shield then. No sharp edges.

05:44.929 --> 05:49.100
Diana, you are the most
precious thing in the world to me.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.980
I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself

05:54.147 --> 05:56.691
and begged Zeus to give you life.

05:56.858 --> 05:58.651
You've told me this story.

05:59.235 --> 06:02.655
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

06:03.281 --> 06:06.451
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.618
Yes!

06:07.785 --> 06:11.289
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

06:17.628 --> 06:20.339
Long ago, when time was new

06:21.007 --> 06:23.968
and all of history was still a dream,

06:24.135 --> 06:26.471
<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i>

06:26.637 --> 06:29.307
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

06:31.851 --> 06:35.021
<i>Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.</i>

06:35.563 --> 06:38.066
<i>Beings born in his image,</i>

06:38.232 --> 06:41.903
<i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

06:42.820 --> 06:46.741
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

06:47.742 --> 06:50.912
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

06:51.079 --> 06:54.332
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.836
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

07:01.005 --> 07:05.218
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.512
<i>He turned them against one another</i>

07:07.678 --> 07:10.681
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

07:11.682 --> 07:15.728
<i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i>

07:15.895 --> 07:18.523
<i>to influence men's hearts with love</i>

07:18.689 --> 07:21.192
<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

07:24.237 --> 07:27.365
<i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i>

07:33.246 --> 07:34.747
<i>But it did not last.</i>

07:41.420 --> 07:45.091
<i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt</i>

07:45.258 --> 07:48.219
<i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i>

07:55.309 --> 07:58.479
<i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i>

07:58.646 --> 08:01.899
<i>Ares killed them one by one,</i>

08:02.066 --> 08:05.236
<i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i>

08:06.571 --> 08:10.950
<i>Zeus used the last of his power
to stop Ares,</i>

08:11.784 --> 08:16.581
<i>striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.</i>

08:17.790 --> 08:18.916
<i>But Zeus knew</i>

08:19.083 --> 08:23.254
<i>that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.</i>

08:23.838 --> 08:26.299
<i>An endless war,</i>

08:26.465 --> 08:29.468
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i>

08:29.635 --> 08:32.430
<i>and us with them.</i>

08:32.597 --> 08:35.016
<i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i>

08:35.183 --> 08:38.269
<i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i>

08:39.437 --> 08:43.441
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i>

08:43.608 --> 08:45.860
<i>to hide us from the outside world,</i>

08:46.027 --> 08:48.362
<i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i>

08:52.825 --> 08:55.119
<i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>

09:02.835 --> 09:07.006
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.468
And the Godkiller?

09:15.181 --> 09:16.182
The Godkiller?

09:16.349 --> 09:18.976
The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.312
<i>Can I see it?</i>

09:31.364 --> 09:33.199
The Gods gave us many gifts.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.660
One day, you'll know them all.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.080
This great tower is where we keep them.

09:51.509 --> 09:52.677
The Godkiller.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.974
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

09:59.558 --> 10:00.935
Who would wield it?

10:03.437 --> 10:06.023
I pray it will never be called to arms.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.694
But only the fiercest among us
even could.

10:10.278 --> 10:12.071
And that is not you, Diana.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.283
You see, you're safe,

10:15.783 --> 10:18.786
and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.968
You keep doubting yourself, Diana.

10:34.135 --> 10:36.345
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.222
No, I don't.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.420
You are stronger than you believe.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.564
<i>You have greater powers than you know.</i>

10:46.731 --> 10:48.649
<i>- But if you don't try hard—
- Diana!</i>

11:00.411 --> 11:01.412
Are you hurt?

11:01.996 --> 11:03.164
No, Mother, I'm fine,

11:03.372 --> 11:05.041
- I was just—
- Training.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.045
It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.422
Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...

11:11.589 --> 11:13.799
No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to...

11:13.966 --> 11:15.176
Take her to the palace.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.012
Off you go.

11:26.604 --> 11:28.731
You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.152
You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.

11:33.319 --> 11:35.404
You speak of a time that may never come.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.491
He might never return.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.369
He could have died from his wounds.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.455
Ares is alive.

11:44.622 --> 11:47.958
You feel it, as I do, in your bones.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.253
It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

11:55.174 --> 11:59.011
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

11:59.178 --> 12:01.931
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

12:03.474 --> 12:06.394
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

12:17.446 --> 12:20.866
You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.452
<i>Five times harder,</i>

12:23.619 --> 12:25.663
<i>ten times harder.</i>

12:25.830 --> 12:28.749
<i>Until she is better than even you.</i>

12:29.333 --> 12:31.293
<i>But she must never know the truth</i>

12:31.460 --> 12:33.212
<i>about what she is</i>

12:33.379 --> 12:35.214
<i>or how she came to be.</i>

13:29.852 --> 13:31.103
Harder.

13:31.270 --> 13:34.064
<i>You're stronger than this, Diana.</i>

13:34.273 --> 13:35.399
Again.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.001
Never let your guard down.

13:55.211 --> 13:56.962
You expect the battle to be fair.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.547
A battle will never be fair.

14:12.478 --> 14:13.479
Antiope!

14:15.397 --> 14:16.398
Lay still.

14:16.774 --> 14:17.775
You are bleeding.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.779
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana, wait.

14:28.077 --> 14:29.245
What have I done?

14:31.080 --> 14:32.164
I'm sorry.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.776
<i>Where did this fog come from?</i>

17:09.655 --> 17:12.199
There. Go forward!

17:29.341 --> 17:31.427
<i>There he is! The pilot! I can see him.</i>

17:31.593 --> 17:32.803
He's there!

18:03.667 --> 18:04.668
Wow.

18:07.755 --> 18:09.089
You're a man.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.346
Yeah. I mean...

18:18.515 --> 18:20.017
Do I not look like one?

18:24.605 --> 18:25.814
Where are we?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.858
Themyscira.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.276
Therma-what?

18:29.777 --> 18:30.778
Who are you?

18:39.161 --> 18:41.789
I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys.

18:41.955 --> 18:42.998
What?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.018
The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.169
- The Germans?
<i>- Diana!</i>

18:47.336 --> 18:49.546
Step away from her, now!

18:51.799 --> 18:53.050
<i>Ready your bows!</i>

18:56.553 --> 18:57.888
They have guns, right?

18:58.055 --> 18:59.640
Fire!

19:00.849 --> 19:02.392
Fire!

19:03.519 --> 19:04.895
Come on!

20:42.075 --> 20:43.076
Stay there!

21:21.114 --> 21:22.199
Shield!

21:43.387 --> 21:45.138
No!

21:45.305 --> 21:46.306
No!

21:52.187 --> 21:53.563
No.

21:53.730 --> 21:57.693
No, no. Antiope. Antiope.

21:57.859 --> 22:00.529
Antiope, hey. Hey, hey.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.323
Hey.

22:03.907 --> 22:04.908
- Diana.
- Be still.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.203
The time has come.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.415
You... You must...

22:11.581 --> 22:14.751
What? What, Antiope?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.257
Godkiller.

22:20.841 --> 22:22.884
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

22:23.677 --> 22:25.012
- Go where?
- Go...

22:25.178 --> 22:28.056
No, please, no. No. No!

22:28.223 --> 22:30.183
No, no, no.

22:30.976 --> 22:32.811
- No!
- Antiope!

22:34.396 --> 22:35.564
No!

22:42.779 --> 22:44.114
- You.
- No.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.034
No, Mother, no.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.952
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

22:49.119 --> 22:50.954
What man fights against his own people?

22:51.121 --> 22:53.957
- These aren't my people.
- Then why do you wear their colors?

22:56.084 --> 22:57.085
I can't tell you that.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.295
You need to tell us now!

22:58.462 --> 22:59.504
What is your name?

23:00.881 --> 23:02.257
I can't tell you that either.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.886
We should kill him now,
and be done with it.

23:06.053 --> 23:07.054
<i>If he dies,</i>

23:07.721 --> 23:12.392
we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.735
My, uh,

23:23.153 --> 23:27.657
name is Captain Steve Trevor,
pilot, American Expeditionary Forces.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.952
Serial number 8141921.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.371
That's all I'm at liberty to...

23:37.667 --> 23:39.503
Assigned to British Intelligence.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.964
What the hell is this thing?

23:43.131 --> 23:46.176
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.178
But it's really hot.

23:48.345 --> 23:51.348
It is pointless, and painful, to resist.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.308
What is your mission?

23:53.475 --> 23:57.270
Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.480
What is your mission?

24:01.858 --> 24:02.859
I am a...

24:07.531 --> 24:08.532
I am a...

24:11.868 --> 24:13.203
I am a spy.

24:16.540 --> 24:19.000
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.046
<i>British Intelligence got word</i>

24:23.213 --> 24:25.674
<i>that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,</i>

24:25.841 --> 24:29.719
<i>would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire.</i>

24:29.886 --> 24:33.056
<i>I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.</i>

24:33.223 --> 24:36.726
<i>According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,</i>

24:36.893 --> 24:39.563
<i>no money, no munitions of any kind.</i>

24:39.729 --> 24:41.064
<i>But our intel was wrong.</i>

24:41.231 --> 24:43.942
<i>The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.</i>

24:44.109 --> 24:47.237
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

24:47.404 --> 24:48.989
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

24:50.448 --> 24:55.203
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

24:56.580 --> 24:59.082
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Dr. Poison."</i>

25:00.584 --> 25:01.710
<i>And for good reason.</i>

25:30.572 --> 25:34.075
<i>From what I could tell, if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

25:34.242 --> 25:37.287
<i>millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

25:37.954 --> 25:40.040
<i>I was there to observe and report,
nothing more,</i>

25:41.750 --> 25:43.585
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

25:48.673 --> 25:49.966
<i>I'm so close.</i>

25:50.133 --> 25:53.178
<i>I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask.</i>

25:53.345 --> 25:55.555
I just... I need more time.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.602
Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.559
This work, this...

26:04.898 --> 26:06.149
Get that man!

26:06.316 --> 26:07.525
<i>There!</i>

27:01.538 --> 27:04.958
But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,

27:05.709 --> 27:08.295
it could stop millions more from dying.

27:09.296 --> 27:11.214
It could stop the war.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.508
War? What war?

27:15.719 --> 27:17.137
The war.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.559
The war to end all wars.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.603
<i>Four years,</i>

27:25.770 --> 27:28.023
<i>27 countries,</i>

27:28.189 --> 27:30.150
25 million dead,

27:30.734 --> 27:32.736
<i>soldiers and civilians.</i>

27:32.902 --> 27:34.821
Innocent people,

27:35.739 --> 27:37.991
women and children slaughtered.

27:39.326 --> 27:42.829
<i>Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.</i>

27:46.916 --> 27:49.169
Weapons far deadlier than you can

27:52.088 --> 27:53.590
ever imagine.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.679
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.849
<i>It's like the world's going to end.</i>

28:05.101 --> 28:06.353
Should we let him go?

28:06.519 --> 28:09.105
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

28:09.272 --> 28:11.358
We cannot hold him forever, my queen.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.610
Mother. Excuse me,

28:13.777 --> 28:17.614
but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.141
What are you talking about, child?

28:19.199 --> 28:22.202
Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it "a war without end."

28:23.119 --> 28:25.288
Millions of people already dead.

28:25.789 --> 28:27.707
Like nothing he's ever seen.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.293
Only Ares could do such a thing.

28:32.295 --> 28:35.382
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.361
I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenseless

28:38.385 --> 28:39.427
to go and fight their war.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.471
It is not their war.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.808
Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate...

28:44.974 --> 28:47.394
That was a story, Diana!

28:47.560 --> 28:49.000
There is much you do not understand.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.105
Men are easily corrupted.

28:50.271 --> 28:53.066
Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!

28:53.233 --> 28:56.111
It is Ares who has
these Germans fighting.

28:56.277 --> 29:00.323
<i>And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance.</i>

29:00.490 --> 29:02.909
As Amazons, this is our duty.

29:03.076 --> 29:05.912
But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.415
So you will do nothing.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.162
As your queen, I forbid it.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.514
Strange.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.309
Is it true you saved his life?

29:28.852 --> 29:29.853
Who told you that?

29:30.019 --> 29:31.020
He did.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.378
Whoa! I...

29:57.964 --> 29:59.549
I didn't see you come in.

30:04.888 --> 30:07.724
Would you say you're a

30:08.558 --> 30:11.144
typical example of your sex?

30:11.769 --> 30:13.438
I am

30:16.691 --> 30:18.401
above average.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.156
What's that?

30:25.074 --> 30:26.493
It's a...

30:28.536 --> 30:29.537
Oh! Um...

30:31.748 --> 30:33.666
It's a watch.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.084
A watch?

30:35.251 --> 30:36.252
<i>Yeah, it's a watch.</i>

30:36.419 --> 30:37.837
It tells time.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.840
My father gave it to me.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.150
It's been through hell and back
with him.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.473
Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.517
What for?

30:52.435 --> 30:54.020
Because it tells time.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.941
When to eat, sleep, wake up, work.

30:59.609 --> 31:02.487
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

31:02.654 --> 31:04.113
Yeah.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.121
Can I ask you some questions?

31:13.581 --> 31:14.958
<i>- Where are we?</i>
- Themyscira.

31:15.124 --> 31:18.628
No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.357
What is this place?
Who are you people?

31:21.381 --> 31:23.466
Why does the water do that?

31:23.633 --> 31:26.278
<i>How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?</i>

31:26.302 --> 31:28.429
We speak hundreds of languages.

31:29.305 --> 31:32.684
We are the bridge to
a greater understanding between all men.

31:34.894 --> 31:35.979
Right.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.652
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,

31:44.070 --> 31:48.324
but thank you for dragging me
out of the water.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.160
Thank you

31:51.744 --> 31:53.830
for what you did on the beach.

32:01.963 --> 32:02.964
So,

32:04.340 --> 32:05.717
you're here to let me go?

32:07.135 --> 32:10.680
I tried, but it's not up to me.

32:11.222 --> 32:13.016
I even asked them to send me with you.

32:15.518 --> 32:16.936
Or anyone.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.146
An Amazon.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.981
The Amazons.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.608
The Amazons?

32:21.774 --> 32:24.527
<i>It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.</i>

32:25.194 --> 32:27.030
And I wish to go.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.909
But my mother will not allow it.

32:34.329 --> 32:35.330
Well,

32:36.873 --> 32:38.875
I can't say I blame her.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.082
<i>The way this war is going,</i>

32:40.209 --> 32:43.129
I wouldn't want to
let anyone I care about near it.

32:43.296 --> 32:45.214
Then why do you want to go back?

32:45.757 --> 32:47.800
I don't think "want" is the word.

32:49.677 --> 32:52.180
I guess I gotta try.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.142
My father told me once,

32:56.309 --> 32:58.669
he said, "If you see something wrong
happening in the world,

32:58.811 --> 33:01.522
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

33:03.566 --> 33:05.401
And I already tried "nothing."

35:44.310 --> 35:45.353
Nice outfit.

35:46.646 --> 35:47.730
Oh, thank you.

35:48.481 --> 35:51.484
Now, I will show you
the way off the island

35:52.068 --> 35:53.611
and you will take me to Ares.

35:54.445 --> 35:55.446
Deal.

36:04.622 --> 36:05.998
I'm leaving in that?

36:06.165 --> 36:07.416
We are.

36:08.835 --> 36:10.837
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

36:11.003 --> 36:12.463
Do you not know how to sail?

36:12.630 --> 36:13.790
Of course I know how to sail.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.683
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

36:16.634 --> 36:17.969
It's been a while.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.958
I'm going, Mother.

36:49.584 --> 36:52.753
I cannot stand by
while innocent lives are lost.

36:53.629 --> 36:58.050
If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must.

36:59.844 --> 37:01.178
I have to go.

37:01.345 --> 37:02.722
I know.

37:03.890 --> 37:06.225
<i>Or at least I know I cannot stop you.</i>

37:11.939 --> 37:13.691
There is so much...

37:14.734 --> 37:15.943
So much you do not understand.

37:16.110 --> 37:17.570
<i>I understand enough.</i>

37:17.737 --> 37:21.282
That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

37:23.993 --> 37:25.494
Like you once did.

37:26.162 --> 37:28.080
You know that if you choose to leave,

37:29.790 --> 37:31.167
you may never return.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.004
Who will I be if I stay?

37:43.888 --> 37:46.849
This belonged to
the greatest warrior in our history,

37:47.433 --> 37:50.019
our beloved Antiope.

37:50.186 --> 37:52.313
Make sure you are worthy of it.

37:53.898 --> 37:55.149
I will.

37:58.235 --> 38:00.738
Be careful in the world of men, Diana.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.659
They do not deserve you.

38:09.246 --> 38:12.208
You have been my greatest love.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.505
Today,

38:19.548 --> 38:21.550
you are my greatest sorrow.

39:00.423 --> 39:01.799
Should you have told her?

39:02.675 --> 39:07.138
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.651
How long until we reach the war?

39:21.861 --> 39:23.988
The war? Which part?

39:24.155 --> 39:25.406
The Western Front in France

39:25.573 --> 39:27.950
is 400 miles long
from the Alps to the North Sea.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.537
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

39:31.704 --> 39:34.582
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

39:38.502 --> 39:40.880
Ares? As in, the God of War?

39:41.047 --> 39:45.134
The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

39:46.010 --> 39:47.636
With this.

39:49.096 --> 39:50.264
And once I do,

39:50.806 --> 39:52.433
the war will end.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.650
Look, I appreciate your spirit,

40:02.318 --> 40:04.361
<i>but this war is...</i>

40:04.528 --> 40:06.739
It's a great big mess.

40:07.615 --> 40:10.409
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

40:10.576 --> 40:13.296
I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can.

40:13.329 --> 40:15.414
I'm the man who can!

40:15.581 --> 40:17.374
And once I find and destroy Ares,

40:17.541 --> 40:20.169
the German armies
will be freed from his influence

40:20.336 --> 40:23.339
and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better.

40:27.843 --> 40:28.844
Great.

40:29.762 --> 40:30.846
You'll see.

40:34.308 --> 40:35.351
What are you doing?

40:35.768 --> 40:37.853
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to

40:39.271 --> 40:40.397
get some sleep.

40:43.359 --> 40:46.529
And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?

40:46.695 --> 40:48.364
Does the average man not sleep?

40:52.493 --> 40:55.621
Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh...

40:55.788 --> 40:56.868
You don't sleep with women?

40:56.956 --> 40:59.875
No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with...

41:01.210 --> 41:02.628
Yes, I do.

41:02.795 --> 41:05.256
But, out of the, uh,

41:05.464 --> 41:07.842
confines of marriage

41:08.008 --> 41:09.426
it's just...

41:11.887 --> 41:13.889
It's not polite to assume, you know?

41:17.643 --> 41:19.103
"Marriage"?

41:19.270 --> 41:21.188
Marriage. Do you not have that on...

41:22.439 --> 41:23.816
You go before a judge

41:23.983 --> 41:28.154
and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other

41:28.320 --> 41:29.446
until death do you part.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.575
And do they?
Love each other till death?

41:32.741 --> 41:34.493
Not very often, no.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.078
Then why do they do it?

41:36.871 --> 41:39.331
I have no idea.

41:40.166 --> 41:41.977
So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.321
I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

41:44.378 --> 41:45.462
<i>There's plenty of room.</i>

41:45.629 --> 41:48.174
- Then, fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.902
I know it's up to me, I'm making
the choice. I will come sleep with you.

41:50.926 --> 41:51.927
Okay.

41:54.805 --> 41:55.973
Yeah, just...

41:57.266 --> 41:58.475
Okay.

42:13.490 --> 42:18.120
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

42:18.871 --> 42:21.081
You know, being a spy,

42:21.248 --> 42:24.543
you have to show a certain amount of

42:26.587 --> 42:27.796
vigor.

42:31.050 --> 42:34.303
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

42:34.470 --> 42:36.222
I had no father.

42:36.889 --> 42:38.515
My mother sculpted me from clay

42:38.682 --> 42:40.809
and I was brought to life by Zeus.

42:44.188 --> 42:45.648
Well, that's neat.

42:49.235 --> 42:50.653
<i>Sorry.</i>

42:53.155 --> 42:54.657
Where I come from,

42:55.908 --> 42:58.202
babies are made differently.

42:59.203 --> 43:01.038
You refer to reproductive biology.

43:01.205 --> 43:02.790
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.125
I know all about that.

43:05.292 --> 43:08.128
I mean, I refer to that,
and other things.

43:09.046 --> 43:10.339
The pleasures of the flesh.

43:13.217 --> 43:15.135
Do you know about that?

43:16.303 --> 43:20.099
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
<i>Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.</i>

43:21.934 --> 43:23.978
- All 12, huh?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

43:28.607 --> 43:30.067
Did you bring any of those with you?

43:30.693 --> 43:31.860
You would not enjoy them.

43:32.027 --> 43:33.362
I don't know. Maybe.

43:33.529 --> 43:34.655
<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>

43:34.822 --> 43:36.198
Why not?

43:36.365 --> 43:39.493
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,

43:39.660 --> 43:41.537
but when it comes to pleasure,

43:41.870 --> 43:43.789
unnecessary.

43:43.956 --> 43:45.457
No, no.

43:50.087 --> 43:51.088
Good night.

43:51.297 --> 43:52.548
Night.

44:05.060 --> 44:06.687
How long until we are operational?

44:06.854 --> 44:08.063
Two days, sir.

44:08.230 --> 44:09.898
You have until tonight, Captain.

44:10.065 --> 44:14.194
Sir, the men have had no food,
no sleep.

44:14.361 --> 44:16.530
Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?

44:16.989 --> 44:18.615
Do you hear me making excuses?

44:18.782 --> 44:19.783
No.

44:19.950 --> 44:21.410
Your men are weak, complacent.

44:21.577 --> 44:24.538
You've let them forget that
an attack can happen at any time,

44:24.705 --> 44:26.123
from any quarter!

44:26.290 --> 44:27.570
So, let's you and I remind them,

44:27.624 --> 44:28.625
shall we?

44:43.432 --> 44:45.225
- Doctor.
- General.

44:45.392 --> 44:46.393
Progress?

44:46.560 --> 44:47.853
Not enough.

44:48.729 --> 44:50.689
It is over, General.

44:50.856 --> 44:52.733
Germany is giving up.

44:52.900 --> 44:56.820
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the <i>Kaiser</i> sign the armistice.

44:56.987 --> 44:59.031
We have run out of time.

45:00.657 --> 45:03.452
As soon as the <i>Kaiser</i>
sees the newest weapon,

45:03.619 --> 45:05.329
he will not sign the armistice.

45:05.496 --> 45:06.580
But, without my book...

45:06.747 --> 45:07.998
We will get your book!

45:08.165 --> 45:10.626
It is you that I believe in. Not it.

45:12.002 --> 45:15.047
I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm.

45:16.882 --> 45:20.219
It is what you were put on this earth
to do.

45:23.847 --> 45:27.267
Something did come to me last night.

45:27.434 --> 45:29.436
A different type of gas.

45:30.354 --> 45:31.438
For you.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.982
<i>To restore your strength.</i>

46:04.096 --> 46:06.432
<i>I've got it. I've got it!</i>

46:07.015 --> 46:10.102
And if it's what I think,

46:11.270 --> 46:13.105
it's going to be

46:14.690 --> 46:16.191
terrible.

46:37.504 --> 46:38.672
<i>Morning!</i>

46:39.173 --> 46:41.717
We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time.

46:41.884 --> 46:44.219
<i>Welcome to jolly old London!</i>

46:44.595 --> 46:46.013
It's hideous.

46:46.555 --> 46:48.015
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

47:10.412 --> 47:11.872
- Morning, darling.
- What a beauty.

47:12.039 --> 47:13.040
Hello, beautiful!

47:13.207 --> 47:15.709
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

47:17.669 --> 47:19.630
Come on! Come on.

47:21.173 --> 47:22.758
Why are they holding hands?

47:23.050 --> 47:25.802
Uh, probably because they're together.

47:28.555 --> 47:31.099
No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way.

47:31.266 --> 47:32.267
This way.

47:32.434 --> 47:33.644
To the war!

47:33.810 --> 47:36.498
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first.

47:36.522 --> 47:38.023
And where are we going?

47:38.190 --> 47:39.942
We gotta get this notebook
to my superiors.

47:40.108 --> 47:41.193
Hey, hey, hey!

47:41.360 --> 47:44.488
No, no, no.
I let you go, you take me to Ares.

47:44.655 --> 47:46.406
We made a deal, Steve Trevor.

47:46.573 --> 47:47.950
And a deal is a promise.

47:48.116 --> 47:49.952
And a promise is unbreakable.

47:50.702 --> 47:52.788
Oh, boy. Damn it. All right.

47:54.039 --> 47:55.874
You come with me first
to deliver this,

47:56.041 --> 47:58.335
and then we'll get you a ticket,
uh...

47:58.585 --> 47:59.670
to the war.

47:59.962 --> 48:00.963
Deal?

48:02.464 --> 48:03.590
- Let's go.
- Diana...

48:03.757 --> 48:04.758
What are you doing?

48:04.925 --> 48:07.028
You can't do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

48:07.052 --> 48:10.305
Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes.

48:10.472 --> 48:12.266
What do these women wear into battle?

48:12.432 --> 48:13.809
They don't, uh...

48:14.017 --> 48:15.602
A baby!

48:16.979 --> 48:18.373
- No, no, no. No babies.
- Oh... Oh...

48:18.397 --> 48:20.065
No, please. No babies.

48:20.232 --> 48:22.025
That one's not made out of clay.

48:22.359 --> 48:23.443
Come on.

48:23.610 --> 48:25.612
Diana! Please.

48:40.836 --> 48:43.338
Thank God! You're not dead!

48:44.840 --> 48:46.466
Hoorah and huzzah!

48:46.633 --> 48:48.927
I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?

48:49.511 --> 48:51.722
<i>He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.</i>

48:51.888 --> 48:52.889
<i>Very unlike him.</i>

48:53.056 --> 48:55.475
I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

48:55.642 --> 48:57.644
I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.

48:57.811 --> 48:59.146
What is a secretary?

48:59.313 --> 49:00.689
Ooh! Well, I do everything.

49:00.856 --> 49:03.296
I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do.

49:03.567 --> 49:05.986
Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery.

49:06.153 --> 49:07.279
I really like her.

49:07.446 --> 49:08.655
Fantastic. Ladies, after you.

49:08.822 --> 49:09.990
Oh, I do, I like her.

49:10.157 --> 49:12.075
And it does rather feel like that,

49:12.242 --> 49:13.785
except the pay is very good.

49:13.952 --> 49:16.288
We've got our work cut out for us,
haven't we?

49:18.457 --> 49:22.377
Is this what passes for armor
in your country?

49:24.046 --> 49:25.213
"Armor." It's fashion.

49:25.380 --> 49:26.840
Keeps our tummies in.

49:27.382 --> 49:28.634
Why must you keep them in?

49:28.800 --> 49:31.053
Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question.

49:32.763 --> 49:36.308
Conservative,
but not entirely un-fun.

49:37.559 --> 49:38.935
Try it on, at least.

49:39.102 --> 49:40.145
Very well.

49:41.438 --> 49:43.023
- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
- No! No, no, no.

49:43.398 --> 49:44.524
Ooh!

49:49.863 --> 49:51.406
Come on! Oh!

50:00.123 --> 50:02.918
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

50:03.085 --> 50:04.169
Fight?

50:04.336 --> 50:05.921
We use our principles.

50:06.088 --> 50:07.928
I mean, that's how
we're going to get the vote.

50:07.964 --> 50:11.718
Although, I am not opposed to
engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,

50:11.885 --> 50:13.637
should the occasion arise.

50:14.971 --> 50:16.264
Lovely.

50:16.556 --> 50:17.557
Oop!

50:17.766 --> 50:20.185
It's itchy. It's choking me.

50:21.561 --> 50:23.647
Can't say I blame it.

50:23.814 --> 50:25.065
Etta.

50:25.232 --> 50:26.233
Where is she?

50:26.441 --> 50:28.777
Oh, she's trying on outfit number 226.

50:38.620 --> 50:41.748
Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

50:41.915 --> 50:43.083
<i>distracting.</i>

50:45.419 --> 50:46.420
May I?

50:51.133 --> 50:52.467
<i>Really? Specs?</i>

50:52.634 --> 50:55.194
And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

51:01.435 --> 51:02.644
Better.

51:13.780 --> 51:15.115
Yeah, that's not going to work.

51:15.282 --> 51:16.992
Please put the sword down, Diana.

51:17.159 --> 51:18.160
Diana!

51:19.411 --> 51:20.537
Let me try it by myself.

51:20.704 --> 51:21.788
After you, sir.

51:31.339 --> 51:32.340
Etta...

51:32.758 --> 51:35.093
Why don't I meet you
back at the office

51:35.260 --> 51:37.345
and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping.

51:37.512 --> 51:38.513
Oh, no, I don't think so.

51:38.680 --> 51:40.432
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

51:40.599 --> 51:41.993
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

51:42.017 --> 51:44.644
Put the sword down, first of all.

51:47.063 --> 51:50.650
Promise me you will protect it
with your life.

51:51.193 --> 51:52.944
Yes... No.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.238
You can trust her. Just hand that over.

51:55.405 --> 51:57.240
- Shield.
- And the shield to her.

51:57.407 --> 51:58.408
There we go. Whoa!

51:58.575 --> 51:59.576
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

51:59.743 --> 52:01.661
This is easy.

52:03.038 --> 52:04.414
Oh. There we go.

52:32.275 --> 52:33.276
What is it?

52:35.111 --> 52:37.531
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

52:47.207 --> 52:49.251
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on.

52:58.802 --> 53:00.470
Captain Trevor.

53:01.304 --> 53:04.432
I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff.

53:06.059 --> 53:08.728
Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention.

53:08.937 --> 53:11.439
Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.

53:12.065 --> 53:13.567
Where did I put that thing?

53:14.609 --> 53:17.028
Stand back!

53:27.664 --> 53:28.748
Or maybe not.

53:44.806 --> 53:45.974
Tough luck.

53:52.147 --> 53:54.316
Is there anything else
you want to show me?

53:55.650 --> 53:56.930
Where do you think you're going?

53:59.404 --> 54:00.822
Oh!

54:03.575 --> 54:06.286
I'm sorry. But you are
clearly under his control.

54:06.453 --> 54:09.164
- Diana...
- Let me help you get free.

54:09.331 --> 54:10.874
Where will I find Ares?

54:18.214 --> 54:20.508
- He's... He's dead.
- Hmm.

54:21.217 --> 54:22.510
Cyanide.

54:31.353 --> 54:33.063
Stay here. I'll be right back.

54:33.229 --> 54:36.024
<i>Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!</i>

54:36.858 --> 54:40.654
The sad truth is, the majority of them
don't even know what they're fighting for!

54:40.820 --> 54:41.821
Let him speak!

54:41.988 --> 54:44.157
Yes, thank you. Gentlemen...

54:44.699 --> 54:48.745
Germany is an immensely proud nation.

54:50.038 --> 54:51.873
They will never surrender.

54:52.290 --> 54:54.918
Now, look.
The only way to end this war...

54:55.085 --> 54:58.421
Colonel,
I have to talk to you outside.

54:58.588 --> 55:00.840
<i>...and restore world peace</i>

55:01.007 --> 55:02.550
is to negotiate

55:04.260 --> 55:05.971
an armistice.

55:06.554 --> 55:08.974
<i>- There's a woman in here.
- Um...</i>

55:09.140 --> 55:10.620
What's she doing in here?
Get her out.

55:12.477 --> 55:13.728
Get her out.

55:14.396 --> 55:15.438
Sorry.

55:15.605 --> 55:17.899
Blind sister.
She got lost on the way to the bathroom.

55:18.066 --> 55:20.068
I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys.

55:20.777 --> 55:22.946
Um...
Our only aim at this time

55:23.113 --> 55:25.740
must be to achieve peace,

55:25.907 --> 55:27.784
at any cost!

55:31.287 --> 55:33.581
Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace.

55:33.748 --> 55:35.250
Not right now. Sorry.

55:40.088 --> 55:42.942
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?

55:42.966 --> 55:44.926
The intel that I brought back
is time-sensitive.

55:45.093 --> 55:46.533
This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.

55:46.678 --> 55:47.679
Notebook or not...

55:47.846 --> 55:48.990
We need to get it to cryptography

55:49.014 --> 55:50.741
and I need an immediate audience
with the generals.

55:50.765 --> 55:53.077
You do not just barge in here
and demand an audience with the Cabinet.

55:53.101 --> 55:54.787
Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission

55:54.811 --> 55:55.997
could change the course of the war.

55:56.021 --> 55:57.439
<i>Captain Trevor!</i>

55:59.024 --> 56:00.793
I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,

56:00.817 --> 56:02.318
yet here you are,
back from the dead,

56:02.485 --> 56:04.404
and I see you've
brought a friend with you.

56:04.571 --> 56:06.090
Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir.

56:06.114 --> 56:07.741
No, no, no. Nonsense.

56:07.907 --> 56:09.617
Thanks to this young woman,

56:09.784 --> 56:13.288
the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in.

56:13.455 --> 56:15.331
Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.

56:15.999 --> 56:17.959
Diana, Princess of Themys...

56:18.126 --> 56:19.961
"Prince." Diana Prince.

56:20.795 --> 56:21.838
She is, uh...

56:22.005 --> 56:23.006
And I...

56:23.173 --> 56:24.215
Are...

56:24.382 --> 56:25.383
Working together.

56:25.550 --> 56:27.653
<i>She actually helped me
bring this, uh, notebook back here.</i>

56:27.677 --> 56:29.971
<i>That's from Dr. Maru's lab.</i>

56:30.138 --> 56:32.950
I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir.

56:32.974 --> 56:34.809
My God.

56:35.769 --> 56:37.812
- Dr. Poison, herself.
- Yes.

57:07.967 --> 57:09.010
<i>Yes.</i>

57:09.677 --> 57:11.096
<i>Intriguing.</i>

57:11.262 --> 57:12.555
Any further intelligence?

57:12.722 --> 57:15.767
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck.

57:15.934 --> 57:17.852
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages,

57:18.061 --> 57:21.564
but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages.

57:21.731 --> 57:23.358
Ottoman and Sumerian.

57:25.860 --> 57:28.238
Surely, someone else in this room
knew that.

57:28.404 --> 57:29.489
Who is this woman?

57:29.656 --> 57:31.366
<i>She's my, um,</i>

57:32.033 --> 57:33.076
secretary, sir.

57:33.660 --> 57:35.912
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

57:36.496 --> 57:37.956
She's a very good secretary.

57:38.123 --> 57:39.541
See her out.

57:40.166 --> 57:42.836
Sir, if this woman can read it,

57:43.002 --> 57:44.838
<i>we should hear what she has to say.</i>

57:45.004 --> 57:46.714
Yes, very well.

57:52.595 --> 57:54.389
It's a formula

57:54.973 --> 57:56.432
for a new kind of gas.

57:57.016 --> 58:00.520
Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.

58:00.687 --> 58:01.771
Hydrogen-based...

58:01.938 --> 58:04.566
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

58:04.732 --> 58:07.569
The book says they plan to
release the gas

58:07.735 --> 58:09.070
at "the front"?

58:09.237 --> 58:10.238
When?

58:10.405 --> 58:11.573
It doesn't say.

58:12.031 --> 58:13.324
Wait. "Front" of what?

58:13.491 --> 58:14.492
Sir,

58:14.659 --> 58:16.452
that is the evidence we need.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.222
You have to find out
where they're making that gas.

58:18.246 --> 58:19.557
You have to burn it to the ground.

58:19.581 --> 58:20.582
Destroy it.

58:20.748 --> 58:23.293
Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.

58:23.459 --> 58:27.589
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium

58:27.755 --> 58:30.466
as we are negotiating their surrender.

58:30.633 --> 58:32.385
Sir, I've seen that gas
with my own eyes.

58:32.552 --> 58:35.305
If it is used,
it will kill everyone on both sides.

58:35.471 --> 58:36.514
They will all die.

58:36.681 --> 58:39.601
That is what soldiers do, Captain.

58:40.435 --> 58:42.187
<i>Send me in
with some logistical support.</i>

58:42.353 --> 58:45.481
At least give me the chance
to take out Ludendorff's operation myself.

58:45.648 --> 58:46.774
Are you insane?

58:46.941 --> 58:49.235
I can't introduce rogue elements
this late in the game.

58:49.402 --> 58:50.403
Sir, I can...

58:50.570 --> 58:51.779
<i>Now, more than ever,</i>

58:51.946 --> 58:55.617
the armistice
is of paramount importance.

58:55.783 --> 58:59.412
It must be negotiated, it must be signed,
and this is...

59:00.288 --> 59:02.957
Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

59:03.124 --> 59:05.126
Captain, you will do nothing.

59:05.293 --> 59:07.295
And that is an order.

59:08.254 --> 59:09.255
Yes, sir.

59:10.465 --> 59:11.466
I understand, sir.

59:12.425 --> 59:13.468
I don't!

59:13.927 --> 59:15.287
Diana, I know this is confusing...

59:15.428 --> 59:17.615
<i>- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!</i>
- Who is this woman?

59:17.639 --> 59:18.782
She's with me. She's with us, sir.

59:18.806 --> 59:19.891
I am not with you!

59:20.058 --> 59:23.144
You would knowingly sacrifice
all those lives,

59:23.311 --> 59:24.455
as if they mean less than yours!

59:24.479 --> 59:26.290
- Diana, let's talk about this outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

59:26.314 --> 59:29.651
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

59:29.817 --> 59:31.977
- That's enough!
- They fight alongside their soldiers.

59:32.111 --> 59:33.655
They die with them on the battlefield!

59:33.821 --> 59:35.341
- That's enough!
- You should be ashamed.

59:35.365 --> 59:37.285
- My apologies. Diana...
- You should be ashamed.

59:37.367 --> 59:39.007
<i>- Diana...
- All of you should be ashamed!</i>

59:40.161 --> 59:41.788
Please slow down!

59:41.955 --> 59:43.289
That's your leader?

59:43.456 --> 59:45.625
How could he say that?
Believe that?

59:45.792 --> 59:47.210
And you!

59:47.377 --> 59:49.170
Was your duty
to simply give them a book?

59:49.337 --> 59:50.338
No!

59:50.505 --> 59:51.815
You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!

59:51.839 --> 59:53.442
Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!

59:53.466 --> 59:56.135
This is Ares, and he's not going to
allow a negotiation

59:56.302 --> 59:57.720
or a surrender!

59:57.887 --> 1:00:00.515
The millions of people you talked about,
they will die!

1:00:00.682 --> 1:00:02.141
We are going anyway!

1:00:04.686 --> 1:00:06.271
You mean, you were lying?

1:00:06.854 --> 1:00:08.648
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

1:00:08.815 --> 1:00:10.655
How do I know
you're not lying to me right now?

1:00:15.530 --> 1:00:17.031
I am taking you to the front.

1:00:17.699 --> 1:00:19.742
We are probably going to die.

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:22.704
This is a terrible idea.

1:00:27.375 --> 1:00:29.335
We're going to need reinforcements.

1:00:39.721 --> 1:00:41.180
These are the reinforcements?

1:00:41.347 --> 1:00:42.765
Yup.

1:00:43.182 --> 1:00:44.934
Are these even good men?

1:00:45.852 --> 1:00:47.061
Hmm. Relatively.

1:00:48.354 --> 1:00:52.066
Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

1:00:52.233 --> 1:00:56.529
But the luxury that we have now...
It's like we can't stop making money!

1:00:56.696 --> 1:00:58.948
So, my uncle, the prince, and I...

1:00:59.115 --> 1:01:01.326
Boy! Which prince is that?

1:01:01.868 --> 1:01:04.096
I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers...

1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:05.580
But, seriously, which prince?

1:01:06.414 --> 1:01:09.417
Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,

1:01:09.584 --> 1:01:11.252
<i>could I talk to you for a minute?</i>

1:01:11.586 --> 1:01:13.755
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

1:01:14.505 --> 1:01:15.506
"Bar." Well, a "pub."

1:01:15.673 --> 1:01:18.926
You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you...

1:01:19.969 --> 1:01:21.763
Oh, my goodness gracious.

1:01:22.638 --> 1:01:23.765
That's a work of art.

1:01:23.931 --> 1:01:25.558
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer.

1:01:25.725 --> 1:01:27.894
Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please.

1:01:28.061 --> 1:01:29.062
"Sammy."

1:01:29.228 --> 1:01:31.439
Sameer, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

1:01:31.606 --> 1:01:32.940
Sameer's a top undercover man.

1:01:33.107 --> 1:01:35.587
<i>He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can.</i>

1:01:54.295 --> 1:01:55.380
Oh, you're done.

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:56.547
Where's Charlie?

1:02:00.468 --> 1:02:01.552
<i>Le voilà.</i>

1:02:04.722 --> 1:02:07.016
At least this "Charlie"
is good with his fists.

1:02:07.975 --> 1:02:09.185
That's not Charlie.

1:02:17.110 --> 1:02:18.152
That's Charlie.

1:02:22.490 --> 1:02:23.491
Steven!

1:02:23.950 --> 1:02:26.494
May God put a flower
upon your head, son.

1:02:26.661 --> 1:02:27.954
Good to see you.

1:02:29.455 --> 1:02:31.499
<i>So, what were you fighting about?</i>

1:02:32.458 --> 1:02:35.378
I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens.

1:02:35.545 --> 1:02:37.130
This man is no fighter.

1:02:37.296 --> 1:02:39.173
Charlie is an expert marksman.

1:02:39.674 --> 1:02:40.714
It means he shoots people.

1:02:40.842 --> 1:02:42.510
From very far away.

1:02:42.844 --> 1:02:44.303
They never know what hit them.

1:02:45.972 --> 1:02:48.558
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

1:02:48.724 --> 1:02:50.893
I don't. Trust me, it's better that way.

1:02:51.060 --> 1:02:52.437
You fight without honor.

1:02:53.020 --> 1:02:54.647
Who gets paid for honor? Eh?

1:02:55.982 --> 1:02:57.358
So, what's the job, boss?

1:02:58.860 --> 1:02:59.986
Uh, two days, tops.

1:03:00.153 --> 1:03:02.572
We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium.

1:03:02.738 --> 1:03:03.823
And what's the going rate?

1:03:03.990 --> 1:03:05.032
Better be a good pay.

1:03:05.199 --> 1:03:07.326
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

1:03:08.161 --> 1:03:10.329
Um, I told you it was going to be quick.

1:03:11.789 --> 1:03:14.333
And there's a lot to be gained by this.

1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:16.377
So, it's for a great cause...

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:17.795
Uh, freedom...

1:03:18.004 --> 1:03:19.005
Hmm.

1:03:19.213 --> 1:03:20.590
Friendship,

1:03:23.176 --> 1:03:24.319
uh, ending the war, friendship...

1:03:24.343 --> 1:03:25.678
- Okay, you have no money.
- No.

1:03:33.352 --> 1:03:34.604
What?

1:03:34.770 --> 1:03:35.897
What is this?

1:03:36.063 --> 1:03:37.663
We're going to drop her off
at the front.

1:03:37.690 --> 1:03:39.317
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

1:03:39.942 --> 1:03:42.195
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm not going to get myself killed

1:03:42.361 --> 1:03:43.672
helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.

1:03:43.696 --> 1:03:45.740
- Know what I mean?
- Here's the little thief now!

1:03:45.907 --> 1:03:47.909
We don't need your kind around here.

1:03:58.085 --> 1:03:59.337
She did it!

1:03:59.921 --> 1:04:02.798
I'm both frightened and aroused.

1:04:09.096 --> 1:04:10.866
- Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
- Sir Patrick!

1:04:10.890 --> 1:04:12.490
Yes, that's what I was going to mention.

1:04:14.268 --> 1:04:16.062
- Sir Patrick.
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

1:04:16.229 --> 1:04:18.397
Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit.

1:04:22.610 --> 1:04:24.820
I assume you're here
planning something

1:04:24.987 --> 1:04:28.157
that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed.

1:04:28.324 --> 1:04:30.201
And I assume you're here to stop us.

1:04:30.826 --> 1:04:31.953
No.

1:04:32.119 --> 1:04:33.788
Not at all, in fact.

1:04:34.789 --> 1:04:35.790
Well, look.

1:04:35.957 --> 1:04:37.250
I was a younger man, once.

1:04:37.416 --> 1:04:40.456
And, had I been in better health, I'd like
to think that I might do the same.

1:04:40.628 --> 1:04:41.629
Hmm.

1:04:41.837 --> 1:04:44.090
<i>It's a very,
very honorable thing you're doing.</i>

1:04:44.257 --> 1:04:45.258
Therefore,

1:04:46.467 --> 1:04:47.802
I'm here to help.

1:04:48.469 --> 1:04:49.845
Unofficially, of course.

1:04:50.972 --> 1:04:52.181
What's your plan?

1:04:53.599 --> 1:04:56.644
If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it.

1:04:57.144 --> 1:04:59.105
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

1:05:00.356 --> 1:05:03.109
In that case, to allay suspicion,

1:05:03.776 --> 1:05:07.905
the charming Etta, here,
could, uh, run the mission from my office.

1:05:08.489 --> 1:05:09.490
"Run"...

1:05:11.701 --> 1:05:12.702
Also,

1:05:13.661 --> 1:05:16.163
there's enough here for a few days.

1:05:21.669 --> 1:05:22.712
Thank you, sir.

1:05:22.878 --> 1:05:24.463
You're very welcome.

1:05:25.006 --> 1:05:27.049
Take great care, all of you,

1:05:27.216 --> 1:05:28.217
<i>and good luck.</i>

1:05:39.562 --> 1:05:40.563
Cheers!

1:05:49.614 --> 1:05:51.532
Fresh ice cream, made today. Hello, miss.

1:05:51.699 --> 1:05:53.099
Would you like to buy an ice cream?

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:54.785
- Me?
- Are you hungry?

1:05:54.952 --> 1:05:55.953
Yes.

1:05:56.162 --> 1:05:57.371
Thank you.

1:05:57.538 --> 1:05:58.581
Eight pence, please, sir.

1:05:58.748 --> 1:06:00.108
Here you go, pal. Keep the change.

1:06:00.207 --> 1:06:02.376
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Mmm.

1:06:02.585 --> 1:06:04.065
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful!

1:06:04.211 --> 1:06:05.212
Yeah.

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:08.841
- You should be very proud.
<i>- Thank you very much!</i>

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:10.384
You should be very proud.

1:06:13.721 --> 1:06:17.058
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

1:06:17.224 --> 1:06:20.603
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

1:06:20.770 --> 1:06:24.023
I hope our guy meets us here.
Chief's expecting us before dark.

1:06:24.732 --> 1:06:25.775
"Chief"?

1:06:26.776 --> 1:06:28.402
Uh, yeah. A smuggler.

1:06:29.236 --> 1:06:30.696
Very reputable.

1:06:31.072 --> 1:06:34.200
A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.

1:06:34.742 --> 1:06:35.743
Lovely.

1:06:36.243 --> 1:06:37.536
Careful, I might get offended.

1:06:37.703 --> 1:06:39.246
I wasn't referring to you.

1:06:39.705 --> 1:06:40.706
Really?

1:06:40.956 --> 1:06:42.996
I went undercover
and pretended to be somebody else,

1:06:43.084 --> 1:06:44.895
shot people on your beach,
and smuggled a notebook.

1:06:44.919 --> 1:06:47.421
Liar, murderer, smuggler.
Are you still coming?

1:07:07.066 --> 1:07:08.067
It's awful.

1:07:09.443 --> 1:07:10.945
That's why we're here.

1:07:29.004 --> 1:07:30.798
The gas will kill everything.

1:07:30.965 --> 1:07:33.676
What kind of weapon kills innocents?

1:07:34.135 --> 1:07:35.678
In this war,

1:07:35.845 --> 1:07:37.179
every kind.

1:07:42.685 --> 1:07:45.187
You were absent
at the council meeting, General.

1:07:45.354 --> 1:07:48.065
I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me.

1:07:48.232 --> 1:07:50.985
- On the <i>Kaiser's</i> behalf.
- And on your insistence!

1:07:51.527 --> 1:07:54.613
We could easily win this war,
if only you had a little faith.

1:07:54.780 --> 1:07:56.073
<i>We don't.</i>

1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:57.908
<i>There are shortages of food,</i>

1:07:58.075 --> 1:07:59.869
medicine, ammunition.

1:08:00.995 --> 1:08:04.749
Every hour we delay
costs thousands of German lives.

1:08:04.915 --> 1:08:07.585
One attack and the war can be ours!

1:08:10.254 --> 1:08:12.089
As we speak, my chemist...

1:08:12.256 --> 1:08:14.467
We stand against you and your

1:08:14.759 --> 1:08:15.760
witch.

1:08:16.218 --> 1:08:18.095
Ludendorff, enough!

1:08:19.472 --> 1:08:21.432
Twenty-four hours from now,

1:08:21.599 --> 1:08:23.684
this war will end.

1:08:24.268 --> 1:08:25.770
It is over.

1:08:26.979 --> 1:08:28.564
It is over for you.

1:08:32.193 --> 1:08:33.736
It is over for all of you.

1:08:50.628 --> 1:08:51.962
But the mask won't help.

1:08:52.129 --> 1:08:54.006
They don't know that.

1:09:08.979 --> 1:09:09.980
Let's go!

1:09:10.147 --> 1:09:12.441
Time to stage a demonstration
for the <i>Kaiser!</i>

1:09:14.902 --> 1:09:15.945
You're late.

1:09:16.111 --> 1:09:17.488
<i>Cowboy sneak-attack, Chief!</i>

1:09:18.489 --> 1:09:19.490
How are you?

1:09:20.324 --> 1:09:21.884
- Good to see you, pal.
<i>- Okay, big man!</i>

1:09:24.662 --> 1:09:26.497
- Good to see you.
- Ah, yes!

1:09:27.248 --> 1:09:28.749
Good to see you, my friend.

1:09:29.667 --> 1:09:30.918
You beauty!

1:09:31.669 --> 1:09:33.045
Who is this?

1:09:39.844 --> 1:09:41.470
And I am Diana.

1:09:42.346 --> 1:09:43.389
Where did you find her?

1:09:43.931 --> 1:09:45.099
She found me.

1:09:45.683 --> 1:09:47.977
- I plucked him from the sea.
<i>- It's a long story.</i>

1:09:48.143 --> 1:09:49.371
We don't have to
talk about that right now.

1:09:49.395 --> 1:09:50.813
What's there?

1:09:51.981 --> 1:09:53.983
British tea for the Germans,

1:09:54.149 --> 1:09:56.110
German beer for the British.

1:09:57.820 --> 1:10:00.197
And Edgar Rice Burroughs novels
for both.

1:10:00.364 --> 1:10:01.407
And guns!

1:10:03.367 --> 1:10:06.287
Well, may we get what we want!

1:10:06.453 --> 1:10:07.788
May we get what we need.

1:10:07.955 --> 1:10:10.207
But may we never get what we deserve.

1:10:10.374 --> 1:10:11.750
Bang!

1:10:18.674 --> 1:10:20.009
Strange thunder.

1:10:21.552 --> 1:10:23.053
German 77s.

1:10:23.387 --> 1:10:24.722
Guns. Big ones.

1:10:25.973 --> 1:10:27.308
It's the front, out there.

1:10:28.642 --> 1:10:30.019
The evening hate.

1:10:30.728 --> 1:10:32.646
So, who do you fight for in this war?

1:10:32.813 --> 1:10:33.981
I don't fight.

1:10:34.148 --> 1:10:36.150
<i>You're here for profit, then?</i>

1:10:36.525 --> 1:10:38.527
No better place to be.

1:10:39.862 --> 1:10:42.132
Nowhere better to be than in a war
where you don't take a side?

1:10:42.156 --> 1:10:43.324
<i>I have nowhere else.</i>

1:10:43.866 --> 1:10:45.468
The last war
took everything from my people.

1:10:45.492 --> 1:10:46.785
We have nothing left.

1:10:47.661 --> 1:10:48.871
At least here,

1:10:49.663 --> 1:10:51.081
I'm free.

1:10:51.665 --> 1:10:53.542
Who took that from your people?

1:10:54.168 --> 1:10:55.502
His people.

1:11:00.549 --> 1:11:01.550
<i>Don't go...</i>

1:11:02.259 --> 1:11:04.887
Don't go in. Don't go!

1:11:05.054 --> 1:11:07.348
<i>Don't! Boys, no!</i>

1:11:07.514 --> 1:11:08.515
Don't go in there!

1:11:08.682 --> 1:11:10.142
Shh. You're safe.

1:11:10.309 --> 1:11:12.478
You're safe. Are you okay?

1:11:12.645 --> 1:11:13.979
Get off me, woman!

1:11:14.146 --> 1:11:15.689
Stop making a fuss!

1:11:16.023 --> 1:11:17.191
God!

1:11:21.278 --> 1:11:23.656
He sees ghosts.

1:11:28.661 --> 1:11:29.745
You're going to get cold.

1:11:29.912 --> 1:11:31.038
Oh, I don't...

1:11:31.497 --> 1:11:33.874
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

1:11:49.306 --> 1:11:51.475
<i>Get out of there, now.
We've got to move!</i>

1:11:51.642 --> 1:11:54.061
You bloody animal, move!
Go on! Get on!

1:11:54.228 --> 1:11:56.188
These animals,
why are they hurting them?

1:11:56.355 --> 1:11:58.357
Because they need to move, quick!

1:11:58.524 --> 1:12:00.192
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

1:12:00.901 --> 1:12:02.444
I could help them.

1:12:02.653 --> 1:12:03.933
<i>There's no time. Come on, woman!</i>

1:12:07.074 --> 1:12:08.200
Mama!

1:12:12.997 --> 1:12:14.915
That man... He's wounded.

1:12:15.082 --> 1:12:17.126
<i>There is nothing you can do
about it, Diana.</i>

1:12:17.292 --> 1:12:18.836
<i>We must keep moving!</i>

1:12:39.857 --> 1:12:41.108
What is this?

1:12:41.275 --> 1:12:43.318
You wanted me to take you to the war.
This is it.

1:12:43.485 --> 1:12:44.862
So, where are the Germans?

1:12:45.029 --> 1:12:47.448
A couple hundred yards
across the field.

1:12:47.614 --> 1:12:48.949
- Their trench is...
- Watch out!

1:12:51.577 --> 1:12:53.746
Chief! It's good to see you!

1:12:53.912 --> 1:12:56.123
<i>Oi! Chief's back! He's back!</i>

1:12:57.583 --> 1:12:58.751
All right, let's move!

1:13:14.558 --> 1:13:17.144
- Diana, we have to go.
- We need to help these people.

1:13:17.311 --> 1:13:18.391
We have to stay on-mission.

1:13:18.479 --> 1:13:19.956
The next safe crossing
is at least a day away.

1:13:19.980 --> 1:13:22.542
- What are we waiting for?
- We cannot leave without helping them.

1:13:22.566 --> 1:13:24.151
These people are dying.

1:13:24.318 --> 1:13:26.129
They have nothing to eat,
and in the village...

1:13:26.153 --> 1:13:27.714
- Enslaved, she said!
- I understand that.

1:13:27.738 --> 1:13:28.739
Women and children!

1:13:28.906 --> 1:13:30.258
We need to make
our next position by sundown.

1:13:30.282 --> 1:13:32.451
How can you say that?
What is the matter with you?

1:13:32.618 --> 1:13:34.661
This is No Man's Land, Diana!

1:13:35.245 --> 1:13:37.122
It means no man can cross it,
all right?

1:13:37.289 --> 1:13:39.625
This battalion has been here
for nearly a year

1:13:39.792 --> 1:13:42.169
and they barely gained an inch.

1:13:42.336 --> 1:13:45.631
Because, on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

1:13:45.798 --> 1:13:48.038
pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

1:13:48.133 --> 1:13:50.385
This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible.

1:13:50.552 --> 1:13:51.929
So what? So, we do nothing?

1:13:52.096 --> 1:13:53.847
No, we are doing something.
We are.

1:13:54.014 --> 1:13:55.307
- We just...
- Steve.

1:13:55.474 --> 1:13:56.892
We can't save everyone in this war.

1:13:57.059 --> 1:13:58.268
<i>Steve, Steve...</i>

1:13:58.977 --> 1:14:00.417
This is not what we came here to do.

1:14:16.495 --> 1:14:17.496
No,

1:14:17.663 --> 1:14:19.665
but it's what I'm going to do.

1:14:34.888 --> 1:14:36.223
Diana!

1:14:58.412 --> 1:15:00.706
What the bloody hell
is she playing at?

1:15:17.097 --> 1:15:19.474
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1:15:22.978 --> 1:15:25.063
Stay down! Stay down!

1:15:25.230 --> 1:15:26.607
<i>That's an order!</i>

1:16:19.826 --> 1:16:20.661
Go, now!

1:16:20.827 --> 1:16:22.746
<i>She's done it!
She's got them on the run!</i>

1:16:26.625 --> 1:16:28.835
Get down, get down! She's done it!

1:16:42.557 --> 1:16:43.976
Steve!

1:16:44.184 --> 1:16:45.269
Let's go!

1:16:48.063 --> 1:16:49.773
Come on, go!

1:17:10.043 --> 1:17:11.628
Stay here. I'll go ahead.

1:17:47.247 --> 1:17:48.623
- What the...
- Let's move!

1:18:26.953 --> 1:18:28.455
<i>We need more firepower.</i>

1:19:44.573 --> 1:19:45.657
Sniper!

1:19:45.824 --> 1:19:47.117
Go!

1:19:49.327 --> 1:19:50.328
Get in!

1:19:50.495 --> 1:19:51.955
Charlie, bell tower!

1:20:00.172 --> 1:20:01.292
<i>Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!</i>

1:20:02.424 --> 1:20:04.384
Hey, it's okay.

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:07.721
<i>Huh.</i>

1:20:09.514 --> 1:20:11.516
Follow me! Give me some cover!

1:20:17.689 --> 1:20:19.399
Right!

1:20:19.566 --> 1:20:22.277
We're going to put this on our backs,
and, when I say go,

1:20:22.444 --> 1:20:23.444
- lift hard!
- Okay.

1:20:24.446 --> 1:20:26.323
<i>Diana! Shield!</i>

1:20:30.410 --> 1:20:31.912
Go!

1:21:33.598 --> 1:21:35.642
<i>Stay very,
very still for me, my friends.</i>

1:21:35.809 --> 1:21:37.435
<i>Please. So important.</i>

1:21:41.147 --> 1:21:42.440
Thank you very much.

1:21:42.607 --> 1:21:45.318
This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph.

1:21:45.485 --> 1:21:46.528
Thank you so much.

1:21:52.951 --> 1:21:55.245
<i>For all his talk of shooting,</i>

1:21:55.412 --> 1:21:56.997
he cannot shoot.

1:22:00.083 --> 1:22:02.627
Not everyone gets to be
what they want to be all the time.

1:22:03.169 --> 1:22:05.589
Me, I am an actor.

1:22:05.755 --> 1:22:07.132
I love acting.

1:22:07.299 --> 1:22:09.009
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1:22:10.176 --> 1:22:11.636
But I'm the wrong color.

1:22:12.596 --> 1:22:14.931
Everyone is fighting their own battles,
Diana.

1:22:16.349 --> 1:22:17.809
Just as you are fighting yours.

1:22:24.024 --> 1:22:25.650
It's too much.
I wish you well.

1:22:25.817 --> 1:22:26.818
Thank you, thank you.

1:22:30.989 --> 1:22:32.532
I'm on the... On the phone...

1:22:33.033 --> 1:22:35.535
Uh, it's "Veld." V-E-L-D.

1:22:35.702 --> 1:22:37.245
It's a tiny village.

1:22:37.412 --> 1:22:39.205
<i>It may not even be on the map.</i>

1:22:39.372 --> 1:22:40.707
Ooh! I found it! I found it!

1:22:41.249 --> 1:22:42.834
<i>Did you find Ludendorff's operation?</i>

1:22:43.001 --> 1:22:44.836
No, no, no. But I located him.

1:22:45.003 --> 1:22:47.464
And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,

1:22:47.631 --> 1:22:49.466
at German High Command.

1:22:49.883 --> 1:22:51.551
<i>German High Command, huh?</i>

1:22:51.718 --> 1:22:53.345
So, intel reports

1:22:53.511 --> 1:22:55.680
<i>that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.</i>

1:22:55.847 --> 1:22:57.223
<i>A sort of "last hurrah"</i>

1:22:57.390 --> 1:22:59.684
before the Germans sign the armistice.

1:22:59.851 --> 1:23:02.562
And the <i>Kaiser</i> himself
is going to be there.

1:23:03.063 --> 1:23:05.607
As well as Dr. Maru.

1:23:06.232 --> 1:23:07.835
Actually, the gala could be
perfect cover.

1:23:07.859 --> 1:23:09.569
<i>- Captain Trevor.</i>
- Yes, sir.

1:23:09.736 --> 1:23:12.322
<i>You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near</i>

1:23:12.489 --> 1:23:14.532
that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1:23:14.699 --> 1:23:16.701
<i>You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.</i>

1:23:16.868 --> 1:23:19.204
<i>You cannot compromise the armistice.</i>

1:23:19.371 --> 1:23:21.131
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1:23:21.164 --> 1:23:23.004
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1:23:23.166 --> 1:23:24.167
Hold on one second, sir.

1:23:24.334 --> 1:23:26.354
You shouldn't be bothered
about upsetting the peace accord.

1:23:26.378 --> 1:23:28.213
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1:23:28.672 --> 1:23:29.673
What?

1:23:30.215 --> 1:23:31.216
What is it?

1:23:31.758 --> 1:23:33.718
Of course. It makes complete sense.

1:23:35.220 --> 1:23:38.306
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1:23:38.473 --> 1:23:40.225
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1:23:40.767 --> 1:23:42.185
I mean Ares.

1:23:42.769 --> 1:23:44.187
Ludendorff is Ares!

1:23:45.814 --> 1:23:47.565
Sir, this is our last chance,

1:23:47.732 --> 1:23:49.492
our final chance
to find out where the gas is

1:23:49.651 --> 1:23:51.587
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1:23:51.611 --> 1:23:53.363
No, no, no. I forbid it.

1:23:53.530 --> 1:23:54.739
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1:23:54.906 --> 1:23:56.783
Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?

1:23:56.950 --> 1:23:57.951
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sir...

1:24:01.246 --> 1:24:02.956
How likely is he to respect my wishes?

1:24:03.123 --> 1:24:05.291
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1:24:11.589 --> 1:24:13.258
Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no.

1:24:13.425 --> 1:24:15.301
Sammy, I have to work.

1:24:15.468 --> 1:24:16.779
I gotta rustle up a German uniform.

1:24:16.803 --> 1:24:18.239
I still have to plot the course
for tomorrow.

1:24:18.263 --> 1:24:19.889
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1:24:20.056 --> 1:24:21.575
There is nothing we can do
until tomorrow.

1:24:21.599 --> 1:24:22.719
You said it yourself, Steve.

1:24:22.809 --> 1:24:24.811
So... <i>Madame, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1:24:24.978 --> 1:24:25.979
<i>Incroyable!</i>

1:24:26.730 --> 1:24:28.231
<i>Magnifique!</i>

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:29.441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:24:29.607 --> 1:24:30.817
<i>Monsieur, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1:24:32.944 --> 1:24:34.362
<i>- Et voilà!</i>
- Merci, <i>Sammy.</i>

1:24:34.529 --> 1:24:35.530
<i>Et voilà!</i>

1:24:47.876 --> 1:24:49.169
You did this.

1:24:51.463 --> 1:24:52.464
We did.

1:24:57.427 --> 1:24:58.845
Do you have dancing on

1:24:59.721 --> 1:25:01.014
Paradise Island?

1:25:01.181 --> 1:25:02.974
Dancing, yeah. Of course.

1:25:03.141 --> 1:25:07.187
But these people are just swaying.

1:25:08.021 --> 1:25:11.399
Okay, if you're going to be fighting
the God of War,

1:25:11.566 --> 1:25:14.527
I may as well teach you how to dance,
you poor thing.

1:25:14.694 --> 1:25:17.363
All right, probably without the gun.

1:25:17.530 --> 1:25:18.782
<i>Madame.</i>

1:25:21.534 --> 1:25:23.077
If you would.

1:25:23.745 --> 1:25:24.746
Well...

1:25:26.498 --> 1:25:28.708
If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance.

1:25:28.875 --> 1:25:30.728
- You're not going to the gala.
- Of course I am.

1:25:30.752 --> 1:25:32.629
- No, you're not.
- Why wouldn't I?

1:25:32.796 --> 1:25:34.798
Well, for one,
you don't know how to dance.

1:25:35.340 --> 1:25:37.717
I would argue that
they don't know how to dance.

1:25:37.884 --> 1:25:39.177
Be polite, be polite.

1:25:41.888 --> 1:25:44.307
All right. So, give me your hand.

1:25:44.474 --> 1:25:45.517
Like so.

1:25:46.226 --> 1:25:49.437
And I'm gonna put my arm

1:25:49.604 --> 1:25:51.356
around you, like so.

1:25:52.023 --> 1:25:53.983
And we just...

1:25:54.150 --> 1:25:55.610
What did you call it? "Sway"?

1:25:55.777 --> 1:25:56.903
Then you just sway.

1:25:57.487 --> 1:25:58.988
You're awfully close.

1:26:01.115 --> 1:26:03.243
That's what it's all about.

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:07.330
I see.

1:26:16.297 --> 1:26:18.550
I haven't heard him sing in years.

1:26:35.066 --> 1:26:37.902
It's, uh... It's a snowfall.

1:26:42.282 --> 1:26:43.283
Touch it.

1:26:46.411 --> 1:26:47.912
It's magical!

1:26:48.913 --> 1:26:50.623
It is, isn't it?

1:26:52.667 --> 1:26:54.085
It is, yeah.

1:27:00.633 --> 1:27:04.053
Is this what people do
when there are no wars to fight?

1:27:04.762 --> 1:27:05.763
Yeah.

1:27:07.056 --> 1:27:10.143
Yeah, this and other things.

1:27:10.310 --> 1:27:11.728
What things?

1:27:13.646 --> 1:27:14.647
Um...

1:27:19.152 --> 1:27:20.653
They have breakfast.

1:27:21.237 --> 1:27:22.864
They really love a breakfast.

1:27:23.031 --> 1:27:25.575
And, um, they love to wake up

1:27:26.534 --> 1:27:28.745
and read the paper and go to work.

1:27:29.829 --> 1:27:31.581
They get married.

1:27:32.206 --> 1:27:33.958
Make some babies,
grow old together.

1:27:34.709 --> 1:27:35.793
I guess.

1:27:39.756 --> 1:27:41.257
What is it like?

1:27:45.261 --> 1:27:46.763
I have no idea.

1:29:21.733 --> 1:29:23.151
The villagers gave them to us.

1:29:24.068 --> 1:29:26.779
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1:29:26.946 --> 1:29:27.947
You are.

1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:30.533
Hey, fellas. I know that

1:29:31.784 --> 1:29:33.453
I said this job was two days,

1:29:35.663 --> 1:29:36.748
and a deal's a deal.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.501
You'd get lost without us.

1:29:41.419 --> 1:29:42.420
Yeah.

1:29:43.212 --> 1:29:45.372
<i>We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.</i>

1:29:45.590 --> 1:29:47.175
I'm worried that you won't make it.

1:29:47.341 --> 1:29:48.634
There's no more money.

1:29:48.801 --> 1:29:50.219
We've been paid enough.

1:29:50.803 --> 1:29:52.722
Maybe you're better off
without me, yeah?

1:29:53.723 --> 1:29:55.308
No, Charlie.

1:29:56.768 --> 1:29:58.853
Who will sing for us?

1:29:59.645 --> 1:30:01.773
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh, no, please.

1:30:02.648 --> 1:30:03.900
Sing?

1:30:04.108 --> 1:30:05.818
You asked for it.

1:30:05.985 --> 1:30:09.113
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1:30:09.405 --> 1:30:12.992
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1:30:13.159 --> 1:30:16.829
<i>The sweetest hours I e'er did spend</i>

1:30:17.830 --> 1:30:19.999
You must think
I was born yesterday.

1:30:20.166 --> 1:30:22.043
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

1:30:22.210 --> 1:30:23.377
Every word.

1:30:23.753 --> 1:30:25.129
Wait, wait, wait.

1:30:25.296 --> 1:30:27.215
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1:30:27.381 --> 1:30:29.175
And not a single man among them?

1:30:30.176 --> 1:30:31.427
How do we get there?

1:30:31.719 --> 1:30:33.679
<i>And she thinks</i>

1:30:33.846 --> 1:30:35.890
that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?

1:30:36.057 --> 1:30:38.935
And only by killing him
will the war end? Don't be daft.

1:30:39.102 --> 1:30:40.520
<i>You saw what happened out there.</i>

1:30:41.020 --> 1:30:43.106
<i>The way she charged
that machine-gun nest?</i>

1:30:43.272 --> 1:30:45.066
The way she took out that tower?

1:30:46.567 --> 1:30:47.902
Maybe it's true.

1:30:49.070 --> 1:30:50.404
I think it's true.

1:30:50.863 --> 1:30:51.906
I believe it's true.

1:30:52.073 --> 1:30:53.074
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1:30:53.241 --> 1:30:57.036
Steven, son, you don't really believe
this rubbish, do you?

1:31:20.226 --> 1:31:22.562
Diana! Diana!
Hiding, hiding.

1:31:24.397 --> 1:31:25.815
How the hell do we get into that?

1:31:26.899 --> 1:31:29.652
I see only a couple of guards
on the door to distract.

1:31:29.861 --> 1:31:31.341
Yeah, it won't look suspicious at all

1:31:31.404 --> 1:31:33.048
when I come sauntering
out of the woods on foot.

1:31:33.072 --> 1:31:34.073
I could get in.

1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:35.840
You're not going in. It's too dangerous.

1:31:35.908 --> 1:31:37.493
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1:31:37.660 --> 1:31:38.744
And you're too distracting.

1:31:38.911 --> 1:31:41.372
So, look, I'll go in there,
and follow them

1:31:41.539 --> 1:31:44.143
to wherever they're working on the gas
or, better yet, where it is.

1:31:44.167 --> 1:31:45.561
- Then I'm coming with you.
<i>- No, you're not!</i>

1:31:45.585 --> 1:31:48.421
What you're wearing
isn't exactly undercover.

1:31:48.588 --> 1:31:49.589
I don't know.

1:31:49.755 --> 1:31:51.733
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1:31:51.757 --> 1:31:53.801
<i>We just...
We can't get you in, okay?</i>

1:31:53.968 --> 1:31:55.529
So, I'll scout it out, report back, and...

1:31:55.553 --> 1:31:57.430
But as long as he's still alive,
it doesn't...

1:31:57.597 --> 1:32:00.057
You cannot go into German High Command
and kill anyone.

1:32:00.224 --> 1:32:02.101
You just can't. You have to trust me.

1:32:03.436 --> 1:32:05.271
- Oh, wow!
- Where did that come from?

1:32:05.438 --> 1:32:07.481
Oh, can I drive it?
Please, let me drive it!

1:32:07.648 --> 1:32:08.900
I'll be your chauffeur.

1:32:09.066 --> 1:32:10.276
Come on, come on.

1:32:11.027 --> 1:32:12.028
Stay put!

1:32:12.862 --> 1:32:13.863
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

1:32:14.030 --> 1:32:16.199
A field over there. It's full of them!

1:32:20.786 --> 1:32:22.014
Chief, I say you and me
scope out the area

1:32:22.038 --> 1:32:23.598
in case we need to
beat a hasty retreat.

1:32:23.748 --> 1:32:26.125
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1:32:30.630 --> 1:32:31.839
<i>Colonel.</i>

1:32:35.801 --> 1:32:38.387
Steve, they have invitations.

1:32:39.805 --> 1:32:42.183
Don't worry, play it cool.
You got this. You got this.

1:32:46.479 --> 1:32:47.521
Your invitation, please.

1:32:47.688 --> 1:32:48.689
<i>Dhanyavaad,</i> sahib.

1:32:48.898 --> 1:32:50.498
The colonel and I
wish for many blessings

1:32:50.650 --> 1:32:52.770
and all manner of other things
to fall upon your head.

1:32:52.902 --> 1:32:54.445
Your head must be empty.

1:32:54.654 --> 1:32:56.530
He wants my invitation, you idiot.

1:32:56.697 --> 1:32:57.865
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:32:58.032 --> 1:33:00.493
I must apologize
a thousand, thousand times, my master.

1:33:00.701 --> 1:33:03.663
I make the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1:33:03.829 --> 1:33:05.098
I lost the colonel's invitation.

1:33:05.122 --> 1:33:06.123
What?

1:33:06.290 --> 1:33:09.001
Are you saying we drove all the way
through the mud and rain

1:33:09.168 --> 1:33:10.896
- only for you to lose my invitation?
- I'm a snail.

1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:12.004
No! I'm a bug.

1:33:12.171 --> 1:33:14.048
Not even a bug.
I am the dung of a bug!

1:33:14.215 --> 1:33:15.466
And you're right, master...

1:33:16.175 --> 1:33:17.510
Blessing be upon us.

1:33:28.229 --> 1:33:29.605
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1:33:29.772 --> 1:33:31.941
<i>I'm not going to spend
the entire evening out here,</i>

1:33:32.108 --> 1:33:34.193
you stupid idiots! Move your cars!

1:33:55.423 --> 1:33:56.924
What are you supposed to be?

1:34:00.594 --> 1:34:02.221
What are you doing?

1:34:27.038 --> 1:34:28.080
Excuse me.

1:34:30.916 --> 1:34:32.251
I don't drink.

1:34:40.426 --> 1:34:41.594
Have we met?

1:34:41.761 --> 1:34:43.596
No, but I've been watching you.

1:34:44.597 --> 1:34:46.057
Following your career, I mean.

1:34:47.433 --> 1:34:49.935
<i>You are Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

1:34:50.102 --> 1:34:52.646
The most talented chemist
in the German Army.

1:34:52.813 --> 1:34:54.440
I am a fan.

1:35:05.326 --> 1:35:07.453
I hope I am not crossing a line.

1:35:08.954 --> 1:35:11.374
I know you
and General Ludendorff are

1:35:11.540 --> 1:35:12.583
very close.

1:35:12.750 --> 1:35:16.003
We work well together. Yes.

1:35:16.837 --> 1:35:19.799
But having someone like me behind you,

1:35:20.466 --> 1:35:22.093
I could provide a lot more.

1:35:22.259 --> 1:35:24.136
And who are you?

1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:28.682
A man who would show you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1:35:35.147 --> 1:35:37.650
I love fire. Don't you?

1:35:40.152 --> 1:35:41.821
It is like

1:35:43.155 --> 1:35:45.282
a living act of entropy.

1:35:45.449 --> 1:35:47.827
The ultimate weapon of destruction.

1:35:48.744 --> 1:35:50.955
Reminding us that, in the end,

1:35:51.455 --> 1:35:54.834
everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1:35:57.336 --> 1:35:59.797
There is something reassuring about it.

1:36:05.094 --> 1:36:07.304
I see all of that in your eyes.

1:36:10.766 --> 1:36:13.060
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1:36:29.118 --> 1:36:30.619
<i>I hear it is...</i>

1:36:32.872 --> 1:36:35.124
I hear it is extraordinary.

1:36:35.916 --> 1:36:39.587
I appreciate your interest in my work,

1:36:39.753 --> 1:36:42.047
<i>but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.</i>

1:36:42.214 --> 1:36:43.215
<i>Besides,</i>

1:36:43.757 --> 1:36:46.469
now I see your attention is

1:36:49.638 --> 1:36:50.681
elsewhere.

1:37:14.705 --> 1:37:16.582
Enjoying the party?

1:37:18.584 --> 1:37:21.587
I confess, I'm not sure what it is
we're celebrating.

1:37:21.754 --> 1:37:24.507
A German victory, of course.

1:37:24.673 --> 1:37:25.674
Victory?

1:37:25.841 --> 1:37:28.052
When I hear peace could be so close.

1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:29.261
Peace?

1:37:29.428 --> 1:37:31.555
There's only an armistice

1:37:31.722 --> 1:37:33.724
in an endless war.

1:37:33.891 --> 1:37:35.267
Thucydides.

1:37:35.476 --> 1:37:37.436
Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.

1:37:37.603 --> 1:37:39.438
They understood

1:37:39.605 --> 1:37:41.941
that war is a god.

1:37:42.107 --> 1:37:43.776
A god that requires human sacrifice.

1:37:43.943 --> 1:37:45.861
And in exchange,

1:37:46.028 --> 1:37:47.780
war gives man purpose,

1:37:48.364 --> 1:37:50.574
meaning, a chance to rise above

1:37:50.741 --> 1:37:53.035
his petty, mortal, little self

1:37:53.619 --> 1:37:54.912
and be courageous,

1:37:55.663 --> 1:37:57.164
noble, better!

1:37:58.165 --> 1:38:01.460
Only one of the many gods
believed in that.

1:38:01.877 --> 1:38:04.046
- Mmm.
- And he was wrong.

1:38:05.256 --> 1:38:07.174
You know nothing of the gods.

1:38:07.341 --> 1:38:08.551
<i>Herr</i> General.

1:38:11.470 --> 1:38:13.013
Enjoy the fireworks.

1:38:18.561 --> 1:38:19.645
What are you doing?

1:38:19.812 --> 1:38:21.252
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1:38:21.355 --> 1:38:23.155
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,

1:38:23.190 --> 1:38:24.543
we won't be able to stop anything.

1:38:24.567 --> 1:38:25.568
I will stop Ares!

1:38:25.734 --> 1:38:26.819
What if you're wrong?

1:38:28.487 --> 1:38:30.155
What if there is no Ares?

1:38:31.949 --> 1:38:33.325
You don't believe me.

1:38:33.867 --> 1:38:35.536
I can't let you do this.

1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:37.413
What I do is not up to you.

1:38:44.211 --> 1:38:45.296
Diana!

1:38:49.717 --> 1:38:50.968
<i>Diana...</i>

1:38:51.135 --> 1:38:52.219
<i>It's the gas.</i>

1:38:52.386 --> 1:38:54.430
The village... The village!

1:38:57.391 --> 1:38:58.976
What are they cheering for?

1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:02.688
Diana!

1:39:05.107 --> 1:39:06.734
What did they fire?

1:39:06.900 --> 1:39:07.901
The gas.

1:39:08.068 --> 1:39:09.754
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him. He was in the tower.

1:39:09.778 --> 1:39:11.947
Wherever he goes, you follow.

1:39:12.531 --> 1:39:13.782
How will you find us?

1:39:14.366 --> 1:39:15.576
I know how.

1:40:33.362 --> 1:40:34.697
Diana!

1:40:37.825 --> 1:40:40.494
They're dead. They're all dead.

1:40:41.328 --> 1:40:42.955
I could have saved them.

1:40:43.288 --> 1:40:45.666
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1:40:45.833 --> 1:40:47.793
You stopped me from killing Ares!

1:40:48.335 --> 1:40:50.462
- No!
- Stay away from me!

1:40:50.629 --> 1:40:51.964
<i>I understand everything now.</i>

1:40:52.131 --> 1:40:54.091
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1:40:54.133 --> 1:40:55.300
It's you, too.

1:40:55.926 --> 1:40:57.052
All of you.

1:40:58.178 --> 1:40:59.555
I will find Ares

1:40:59.722 --> 1:41:01.348
and I will kill him.

1:41:04.476 --> 1:41:05.477
Diana!

1:41:06.770 --> 1:41:08.021
That smoke,

1:41:09.022 --> 1:41:10.149
<i>it's the Chief!</i>

1:41:10.315 --> 1:41:11.567
He followed Ludendorff.

1:41:13.068 --> 1:41:14.653
Follow the smoke!

1:41:40.804 --> 1:41:42.347
Hey! Diana, that way!

1:41:58.739 --> 1:42:00.616
Come on! Let's go!

1:42:22.179 --> 1:42:23.764
<i>What a surprise.</i>

1:42:24.473 --> 1:42:25.682
Strange.

1:42:26.975 --> 1:42:29.144
Unfortunately, I have another matter

1:42:30.437 --> 1:42:31.438
to attend to.

1:42:36.610 --> 1:42:38.904
What are you?

1:42:39.071 --> 1:42:40.322
You will soon find out.

1:43:14.731 --> 1:43:18.443
As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me.

1:43:22.614 --> 1:43:24.408
We'll see about that.

1:43:48.682 --> 1:43:50.809
I am Diana of Themyscira,

1:43:52.519 --> 1:43:54.605
<i>daughter of Hippolyta,</i>

1:43:55.480 --> 1:43:57.816
Queen of the Amazons.

1:44:01.069 --> 1:44:03.822
And your wrath upon this world is over.

1:44:20.631 --> 1:44:23.383
In the name of all
that is good in this world,

1:44:23.550 --> 1:44:26.261
I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons

1:44:26.428 --> 1:44:28.263
by ridding this world of you

1:44:28.430 --> 1:44:29.514
forever!

1:45:36.748 --> 1:45:37.749
<i>Diana?</i>

1:45:43.839 --> 1:45:45.090
Diana!

1:45:49.261 --> 1:45:50.512
I killed him.

1:45:52.097 --> 1:45:54.266
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1:45:56.435 --> 1:45:58.645
You kill the God of War,
you stop the war.

1:45:58.812 --> 1:46:00.897
Exactly what we have to do now.

1:46:01.064 --> 1:46:02.482
We need to stop the gas. Come on.

1:46:02.649 --> 1:46:04.085
No. All of this should have stopped!

1:46:04.109 --> 1:46:05.110
Diana...

1:46:05.277 --> 1:46:07.255
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?

1:46:07.279 --> 1:46:09.281
I don't know! I don't know.

1:46:09.448 --> 1:46:11.116
Ares is dead.

1:46:11.283 --> 1:46:13.493
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:15.287
Because, maybe it's them!

1:46:15.829 --> 1:46:16.830
Maybe...

1:46:18.790 --> 1:46:21.418
Maybe people aren't always good.

1:46:22.294 --> 1:46:24.171
Ares or no Ares,

1:46:25.464 --> 1:46:28.842
maybe it's just who they are.

1:46:31.678 --> 1:46:33.055
- Diana...
- No.

1:46:33.221 --> 1:46:34.723
Diana, we can talk about this later.

1:46:34.890 --> 1:46:36.117
- I need you to come with me.
- No. No.

1:46:36.141 --> 1:46:38.060
After everything I saw, it can't be!

1:46:38.226 --> 1:46:39.686
It cannot be!

1:46:40.312 --> 1:46:42.064
They were killing each other.

1:46:42.230 --> 1:46:44.983
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1:46:45.150 --> 1:46:46.693
Children!

1:46:46.902 --> 1:46:49.321
No, it had to be him.
It cannot be them!

1:46:49.488 --> 1:46:51.907
Diana, people... I...

1:46:52.074 --> 1:46:53.575
She was right.

1:46:54.159 --> 1:46:55.160
My mother was right.

1:46:55.327 --> 1:46:57.245
She said,
"The world of men do not deserve you."

1:46:57.412 --> 1:46:59.289
They don't deserve our help, Steve.

1:46:59.456 --> 1:47:01.656
- It's not about deserve!
- They don't deserve our help.

1:47:01.750 --> 1:47:03.585
Maybe we don't!

1:47:05.212 --> 1:47:07.464
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1:47:08.507 --> 1:47:11.343
You don't think I get it
after what I've seen out there?

1:47:13.512 --> 1:47:16.392
You don't think I wish I could tell you
that it was one bad guy to blame?

1:47:17.057 --> 1:47:18.558
It's not!

1:47:20.936 --> 1:47:22.562
We're all to blame.

1:47:22.854 --> 1:47:23.855
I am not.

1:47:25.398 --> 1:47:27.192
But maybe I am!

1:47:31.154 --> 1:47:32.239
Please.

1:47:32.405 --> 1:47:34.199
If you believe that
this war should stop,

1:47:34.366 --> 1:47:36.118
if you want to stop it,

1:47:36.284 --> 1:47:38.537
help me stop it right now.

1:47:40.247 --> 1:47:43.083
Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more.

1:47:43.708 --> 1:47:45.669
Please, please come with me.

1:47:45.836 --> 1:47:47.379
I have to go.

1:47:52.926 --> 1:47:55.387
I have to go.

1:48:07.232 --> 1:48:08.233
Hey! Hey!

1:48:12.737 --> 1:48:14.156
- Where's Diana?
- We're on our own.

1:48:14.322 --> 1:48:16.783
- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?

1:48:17.492 --> 1:48:19.119
<i>Looks like a bunch of gas bombs</i>

1:48:19.286 --> 1:48:21.913
but I can't see
where they're taking them.

1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:23.415
<i>How are we going to get in there?</i>

1:48:24.082 --> 1:48:26.126
I've got an idea. Come on, guys.

1:48:26.293 --> 1:48:27.419
Come on!

1:48:41.266 --> 1:48:42.809
Who's there?

1:48:55.488 --> 1:48:57.032
Sir Patrick.

1:48:57.782 --> 1:49:02.120
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1:49:03.288 --> 1:49:07.250
They only deserve destruction.

1:49:08.293 --> 1:49:09.711
You...

1:49:11.630 --> 1:49:13.632
You're him.

1:49:17.052 --> 1:49:18.470
I am.

1:49:19.054 --> 1:49:23.975
But I am not what you thought I was.

1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:45.705
What is it?

1:49:46.998 --> 1:49:48.416
The future.

1:49:53.004 --> 1:49:55.173
I am not your enemy, Diana.

1:49:57.008 --> 1:50:00.845
I am the only one who truly knows you.

1:50:01.012 --> 1:50:05.433
And who truly knows them, as you now do.

1:50:07.852 --> 1:50:11.690
They have always been,
and always will be

1:50:11.856 --> 1:50:15.694
weak, cruel, selfish,

1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:19.030
and capable of the greatest horrors.

1:50:28.373 --> 1:50:29.874
All I ever wanted

1:50:30.041 --> 1:50:35.005
was for the Gods to see how evil
my father's creation was.

1:50:36.923 --> 1:50:38.633
But they refused.

1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:40.051
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1:50:40.218 --> 1:50:41.219
So I destroyed them.

1:50:41.386 --> 1:50:43.388
...daughter of Hippolyta,

1:50:43.555 --> 1:50:44.795
and I'm here to complete her...

1:50:53.565 --> 1:50:54.816
The Godkiller...

1:50:57.861 --> 1:50:59.779
My dear child,

1:51:01.156 --> 1:51:03.658
that is not the Godkiller.

1:51:06.161 --> 1:51:07.704
You are.

1:51:10.415 --> 1:51:13.418
Only a god can kill another god.

1:51:14.419 --> 1:51:18.340
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons

1:51:18.506 --> 1:51:20.592
as a weapon to use against me.

1:51:20.759 --> 1:51:22.594
No. You liar.

1:51:24.304 --> 1:51:26.765
I compel you to tell me the truth.

1:51:29.100 --> 1:51:30.810
I am.

1:51:56.961 --> 1:51:59.339
I am not the God of War, Diana.

1:51:59.506 --> 1:52:02.217
I am the God of Truth.

1:52:03.510 --> 1:52:05.011
Mankind

1:52:05.637 --> 1:52:07.806
stole this world from us.

1:52:10.475 --> 1:52:14.020
<i>They ruined it, day by day.</i>

1:52:14.187 --> 1:52:18.358
<i>And I, the only one
wise enough to see it,</i>

1:52:20.026 --> 1:52:22.779
<i>was left too weak to stop them.</i>

1:52:23.488 --> 1:52:27.117
<i>All these years,
I have struggled alone,</i>

1:52:27.283 --> 1:52:29.202
<i>whispering into their ears.</i>

1:52:29.369 --> 1:52:34.207
<i>Ideas, inspiration for formulas,</i>

1:52:34.999 --> 1:52:36.626
<i>weapons,</i>

1:52:39.129 --> 1:52:41.631
but I don't make them use them.

1:52:42.507 --> 1:52:44.592
They start these wars on their own.

1:52:45.718 --> 1:52:49.514
<i>All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,</i>

1:52:49.681 --> 1:52:52.225
<i>in the hope
they will destroy themselves.</i>

1:52:53.977 --> 1:52:56.020
<i>But it has never been enough.</i>

1:52:57.689 --> 1:52:59.441
Until you.

1:53:01.484 --> 1:53:05.738
<i>When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you.</i>

1:53:06.239 --> 1:53:09.492
<i>But I knew that
if only you could see</i>

1:53:09.659 --> 1:53:12.495
what the other gods could not,

1:53:14.873 --> 1:53:19.419
then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,

1:53:19.586 --> 1:53:23.590
we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,

1:53:23.756 --> 1:53:26.468
the destruction they bring.

1:53:26.634 --> 1:53:31.931
And we could return this world
to the paradise it was before them.

1:53:33.391 --> 1:53:35.018
<i>Forever.</i>

1:53:37.896 --> 1:53:39.439
<i>I...</i>

1:53:44.110 --> 1:53:46.988
I could never be a part of that.

1:53:50.241 --> 1:53:52.869
My dear, I don't want to fight you.

1:53:53.953 --> 1:53:55.330
<i>But, if I must...</i>

1:54:04.797 --> 1:54:06.591
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:08.426
<i>Sammy, let's go!</i>

1:54:09.052 --> 1:54:10.720
Get this plane out of here!

1:54:40.667 --> 1:54:45.088
Oh, my dear, you have so much to learn.

1:55:10.196 --> 1:55:12.532
Oh, my God!

1:55:12.699 --> 1:55:13.992
What are we gonna do?

1:55:15.827 --> 1:55:18.037
There's not much we can do,

1:55:18.496 --> 1:55:19.998
if that's who I think it is.

1:55:26.004 --> 1:55:27.922
But we can stop that plane.

1:55:40.977 --> 1:55:43.021
<i>If we can get on the radio,</i>

1:55:43.187 --> 1:55:45.064
we can ask Flying Corps
to shoot her down.

1:55:45.231 --> 1:55:48.359
No. If it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out
for 50 square miles!

1:55:48.526 --> 1:55:49.527
We gotta ground it!

1:55:49.694 --> 1:55:51.529
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1:55:51.696 --> 1:55:54.073
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1:56:01.039 --> 1:56:02.832
Is it flammable, Chief?

1:56:02.999 --> 1:56:06.377
Yeah, she said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1:56:13.426 --> 1:56:15.720
I need you guys to clear me a path
to that plane.

1:56:15.887 --> 1:56:18.097
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1:56:19.390 --> 1:56:20.391
Come on!

1:57:03.768 --> 1:57:05.561
Come on! This way! Steve!

1:57:15.947 --> 1:57:17.156
- Go, Steve, come on.
- Go!

1:57:17.949 --> 1:57:19.325
Steve!

1:57:22.161 --> 1:57:24.122
- Go, Steve. Come on.
- Run, run!

1:58:02.243 --> 1:58:05.663
Let's see what kind of god
you really are.

1:58:31.856 --> 1:58:34.525
<i>You will help me destroy them, Diana,</i>

1:58:38.654 --> 1:58:40.531
<i>or you will die.</i>

1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:52.752
<i>Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!</i>

1:58:54.796 --> 1:58:57.048
- Move it, boys! Now!
- Let's go! Run!

1:59:22.907 --> 1:59:25.618
Is that all you have to offer?

1:59:41.843 --> 1:59:45.763
It is futile to imagine you can win.

1:59:46.556 --> 1:59:48.182
Give up, Diana.

1:59:48.349 --> 1:59:49.350
<i>Guys, I'm out.</i>

1:59:52.353 --> 1:59:53.604
Chief! Anything left?

1:59:53.771 --> 1:59:54.856
I got nothing.

1:59:55.022 --> 1:59:56.065
- Anything!
<i>- No.</i>

2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:15.167
Steve.

2:01:01.547 --> 2:01:02.965
Steve...

2:01:06.469 --> 2:01:08.846
No!

2:01:43.798 --> 2:01:46.092
<i>Yes, Diana!</i>

2:01:46.258 --> 2:01:48.970
<i>Take them all!</i>

2:01:49.136 --> 2:01:52.098
<i>Finally, you see.</i>

2:01:52.723 --> 2:01:55.142
Look at this world.

2:01:56.060 --> 2:01:58.854
<i>Mankind did this, not me.</i>

2:02:00.064 --> 2:02:01.983
<i>They are ugly,</i>

2:02:02.149 --> 2:02:04.235
<i>filled with hatred,</i>

2:02:04.402 --> 2:02:05.653
<i>weak,</i>

2:02:05.820 --> 2:02:08.906
<i>just like your Captain Trevor.</i>

2:02:09.073 --> 2:02:11.909
Gone, and left you nothing.

2:02:12.743 --> 2:02:14.912
<i>And for what?</i>

2:02:15.329 --> 2:02:16.622
<i>Pathetic!</i>

2:02:18.457 --> 2:02:19.750
He deserved to burn!

2:02:30.761 --> 2:02:34.473
<i>Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.</i>

2:02:43.607 --> 2:02:47.611
<i>She is the perfect example
of these humans</i>

2:02:49.405 --> 2:02:53.200
<i>and unworthy of your sympathy
in every way.</i>

2:02:54.452 --> 2:02:56.954
Destroy her, Diana.

2:02:57.621 --> 2:03:01.042
<i>You know that she deserves it.
They all do.</i>

2:03:04.628 --> 2:03:06.088
Do it!

2:03:10.801 --> 2:03:12.470
<i>Diana!</i>

2:03:15.848 --> 2:03:17.266
<i>Diana...</i>

2:03:26.025 --> 2:03:27.026
What?

2:03:28.152 --> 2:03:29.820
I have to go.

2:03:32.531 --> 2:03:33.991
What are you saying?

2:03:34.366 --> 2:03:35.367
Steve,

2:03:36.035 --> 2:03:38.329
whatever it is, I can do it.

2:03:38.496 --> 2:03:39.497
No. No.

2:03:39.663 --> 2:03:41.290
- Let me do it.
- No.

2:03:41.457 --> 2:03:43.000
It has to be me.

2:03:43.167 --> 2:03:44.960
It has to be me.

2:03:45.127 --> 2:03:48.130
I can save today.
You could save the world.

2:03:56.972 --> 2:03:59.600
I wish we had more time.

2:04:00.184 --> 2:04:02.686
What? What are you saying?

2:04:05.356 --> 2:04:06.524
I love you!

2:04:18.536 --> 2:04:19.829
You're wrong about them.

2:04:29.755 --> 2:04:31.507
They're everything you say,

2:04:32.258 --> 2:04:34.009
but so much more.

2:04:34.176 --> 2:04:35.553
Lies!

2:05:01.787 --> 2:05:05.416
They do not deserve your protection!

2:05:07.209 --> 2:05:08.377
It's not about deserve.

2:05:13.257 --> 2:05:15.176
It's about what you believe.

2:05:18.429 --> 2:05:19.930
And I believe in love.

2:05:20.097 --> 2:05:24.393
Then I will destroy you!

2:05:52.296 --> 2:05:53.964
Goodbye, brother.

2:09:26.218 --> 2:09:28.554
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

2:09:29.721 --> 2:09:33.475
<i>To end war and bring peace to mankind.</i>

2:09:34.059 --> 2:09:37.896
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light</i>

2:09:38.814 --> 2:09:41.150
<i>and learned that inside
every one of them,</i>

2:09:41.733 --> 2:09:43.986
<i>there will always be both.</i>

2:09:44.862 --> 2:09:47.739
<i>A choice each must make
for themselves.</i>

2:09:47.906 --> 2:09:51.326
<i>Something no hero will ever defeat.</i>

2:09:53.036 --> 2:09:54.037
<i>And now I know</i>

2:09:54.997 --> 2:09:59.626
<i>that only love can truly save the world.</i>

2:10:01.503 --> 2:10:03.172
<i>So, I stay,</i>

2:10:03.338 --> 2:10:05.507
<i>I fight, and I give,</i>

2:10:08.260 --> 2:10:10.262
<i>for the world I know can be.</i>

2:10:15.017 --> 2:10:16.226
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

2:10:19.605 --> 2:10:20.939
