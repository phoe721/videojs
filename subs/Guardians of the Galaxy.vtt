WEBVTT

00:36.969 --> 00:38.458
Peter.

00:39.572 --> 00:43.064
Your momma wants to speak with you.

00:45.010 --> 00:49.310
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

01:22.681 --> 01:26.412
Why have you been fighting with
the other boys again, baby?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.156
Peter?

01:30.256 --> 01:33.850
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.061
Smushed it with a stick.

01:37.863 --> 01:40.695
You're so like your daddy.

01:41.066 --> 01:43.397
You even look like him.

01:44.236 --> 01:46.727
And he was an angel.

01:47.773 --> 01:50.442
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

01:50.542 --> 01:52.942
You got a present there
for Peter, don't you?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.438
Of course.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.710
There.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.218
I've got you covered, Pete.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.491
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

02:12.398 --> 02:14.593
Your grandpa

02:15.034 --> 02:17.736
is gonna take such good care of you.

02:17.836 --> 02:22.102
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

02:25.477 --> 02:26.944
Take my hand.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.178
Peter.

02:33.252 --> 02:34.587
Pete, come on.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.882
Take my hand.

02:42.461 --> 02:43.863
Mom?

02:43.963 --> 02:46.932
No! No! No! No!

02:47.032 --> 02:48.367
Mom! No!

02:48.467 --> 02:50.002
- Come with me.
- No!

02:50.102 --> 02:52.331
No!

02:52.438 --> 02:54.206
You've got to stay here. Please.

02:54.306 --> 02:55.773
No...

02:56.675 --> 02:58.608
Okay?

03:17.496 --> 03:19.224
No.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.509
Mom!

08:27.372 --> 08:28.807
Drop it!

08:28.907 --> 08:30.635
Hey.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.912
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

08:34.012 --> 08:36.446
No problem at all.

08:36.848 --> 08:38.317
How do you know about this?

08:38.417 --> 08:40.052
I don't even know what that is.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.788
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

08:42.888 --> 08:45.224
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.592
This is just an outfit, man.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.261
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
- What is your name?

08:49.361 --> 08:51.630
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.131
- Move!
- Why?

08:53.231 --> 08:55.534
Ronan may have questions for you.

08:55.634 --> 08:59.095
Hey, you know what? There's another
name you might know me by.

09:00.605 --> 09:02.808
Star-Lord.

09:02.908 --> 09:06.937
- Who?
- Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

09:07.612 --> 09:10.239
- Guys?
- Move!

09:10.682 --> 09:13.343
Forget this.

11:03.695 --> 11:05.662
Peter?

11:09.134 --> 11:10.601
What happened?

11:10.902 --> 11:13.029
Hey...

11:13.705 --> 11:15.194
I...

11:15.674 --> 11:17.542
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

11:17.642 --> 11:20.576
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

11:44.035 --> 11:47.205
Scattered riots broke out
across the Kree Empire today

11:47.305 --> 11:50.809
protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor

11:50.909 --> 11:53.878
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

11:55.814 --> 11:57.747
Peter, you have call.

11:58.116 --> 12:00.243
- No, wait, don't!
- Quill?

12:02.254 --> 12:03.588
Hey, Yondu.

12:03.688 --> 12:05.757
I'm here on Morag.

12:05.857 --> 12:07.058
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

12:07.158 --> 12:09.327
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

12:09.427 --> 12:10.695
Well, where are you at now, boy?

12:10.795 --> 12:13.365
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.967
- I slaved putting this deal together.
- Slaved?

12:16.067 --> 12:17.102
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

12:17.202 --> 12:18.236
And now you're gonna rip me off!

12:18.336 --> 12:21.840
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.676
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

12:24.776 --> 12:26.645
- When I picked you up on Terra...
- "Picked me up."

12:26.745 --> 12:28.681
- ...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
- Yeah?

12:28.781 --> 12:30.816
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.151
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

12:33.251 --> 12:34.945
I will find you, I will...

12:35.253 --> 12:38.590
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.325
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

12:40.425 --> 12:41.860
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.299
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him

12:44.400 --> 12:47.065
like we was hired to do!
He was cargo!

12:47.165 --> 12:51.903
- You have always been soft on him.
- You're the only one I'm being soft on!

12:52.003 --> 12:54.773
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

12:54.873 --> 12:57.341
As soon as we get him back here,

12:57.475 --> 13:00.178
I'm gonna kill him myself.

13:00.278 --> 13:02.075
What we do need to worry about,

13:02.981 --> 13:05.881
is who else out there wants that Orb!

13:25.770 --> 13:28.534
They call me "terrorist,"

13:28.707 --> 13:31.801
"radical," "zealot,"

13:32.177 --> 13:35.805
because I obey the ancient
laws of my people, the Kree,

13:36.247 --> 13:39.651
and punish those who do not.

13:39.751 --> 13:42.888
Because I do not forgive your people

13:42.988 --> 13:45.979
for taking the life of my father,

13:46.091 --> 13:50.027
and his father,
and his father before him.

13:50.762 --> 13:55.767
A thousand years of war between
us will not be forgotten!

13:55.867 --> 13:59.165
You can't do this! Our government
signed a peace treaty.

13:59.871 --> 14:02.601
My government knows no shame.

14:03.241 --> 14:06.539
You Xandarians and your
culture are a disease.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.513
You

14:08.613 --> 14:10.916
will never rule Xandar.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.505
No.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.544
I will cure it!

14:28.266 --> 14:29.401
Ronan,

14:29.501 --> 14:31.369
Korath has returned.

14:31.469 --> 14:34.673
Master, he is a thief,

14:34.773 --> 14:36.841
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

14:36.941 --> 14:39.477
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

14:39.577 --> 14:42.380
to retrieve the Orb for
an intermediary known

14:42.480 --> 14:44.015
as The Broker.

14:44.115 --> 14:47.552
I promised Thanos I would
retrieve the Orb for him.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.712
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

14:51.156 --> 14:55.023
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

14:55.326 --> 14:56.494
It will be my honor.

14:56.594 --> 14:58.083
It will be your doom.

14:58.963 --> 15:01.433
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

15:01.533 --> 15:03.234
without his prize.

15:03.334 --> 15:05.301
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

15:05.403 --> 15:06.538
Just like you.

15:06.638 --> 15:07.973
But I know Xandar.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.741
Ronan has already decreed that I...

15:09.841 --> 15:11.308
Do not speak for me.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.812
You will not fail.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.140
Have I ever?

15:36.167 --> 15:37.602
Xandarians.

15:37.702 --> 15:39.904
What a bunch of losers.

15:40.004 --> 15:44.576
All of them in a big hurry to
get from something stupid,

15:44.676 --> 15:46.911
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

15:47.011 --> 15:47.979
Look at this guy!

15:48.079 --> 15:49.648
Can you believe they call us criminals,

15:49.748 --> 15:52.083
when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?

15:52.183 --> 15:54.953
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

15:55.053 --> 15:58.657
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

15:58.757 --> 16:01.157
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

16:01.359 --> 16:05.522
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

16:06.231 --> 16:07.666
Right, Groot?

16:07.766 --> 16:08.833
Groot?

16:08.933 --> 16:10.835
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

16:10.935 --> 16:13.471
That's disgusting!

16:13.571 --> 16:15.507
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.199
Why are you lying?

16:20.311 --> 16:22.347
Looks like we got one.

16:22.447 --> 16:26.906
Okay, humie, how bad does
someone wanna find you?

16:27.919 --> 16:32.583
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

16:46.104 --> 16:47.866
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

16:48.773 --> 16:50.240
The Orb.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.845
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

16:53.945 --> 16:55.680
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.815
And told me to tell you,

16:56.915 --> 16:59.610
that you got the best
eyebrows in the business.

17:01.352 --> 17:02.841
What is it?

17:03.121 --> 17:06.491
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

17:06.591 --> 17:08.626
Yeah, well, I almost
died getting it for you.

17:08.726 --> 17:12.127
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

17:12.330 --> 17:15.060
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.969
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.070
I truly am.

17:19.170 --> 17:23.333
But I want no part of this
transaction if Ronan is involved.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.076
Who's Ronan?

17:25.176 --> 17:28.413
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

17:28.513 --> 17:32.851
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture, my culture,

17:32.951 --> 17:34.660
- is wiped from existence!
- Come on.

17:34.761 --> 17:37.122
He's someone whose bad
side I'd rather not be on.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.752
- What? What about my bad side?
- Farewell, Mr. Quill.

17:42.527 --> 17:44.460
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

17:50.068 --> 17:51.592
What happened?

17:53.371 --> 17:57.003
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.
If there's one thing I hate,

17:57.104 --> 18:00.835
it's a man without integrity.
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

18:01.913 --> 18:04.182
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.841
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

18:07.218 --> 18:09.655
People say it about me, all the time,

18:09.755 --> 18:12.422
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

18:30.508 --> 18:32.134
This wasn't the plan.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.414
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

18:36.514 --> 18:38.817
No! Not her, him!

18:38.917 --> 18:40.816
Learn genders, man.

18:42.186 --> 18:44.347
Biting? That's not fair!

18:47.325 --> 18:49.486
Take it easy!

19:17.755 --> 19:19.457
Fool. You should have learned.

19:19.557 --> 19:21.820
I don't learn. One of my issues.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.160
What the...

19:34.973 --> 19:38.533
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.179
You gotta be kidding me.

19:41.279 --> 19:43.144
Hey!

20:00.331 --> 20:02.834
I live for the simple things.

20:02.934 --> 20:05.595
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

20:10.074 --> 20:12.542
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

20:14.245 --> 20:15.680
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.747
Quit whining.

20:25.656 --> 20:29.353
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

20:29.527 --> 20:31.062
Crap.

20:31.162 --> 20:32.597
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

20:32.697 --> 20:34.499
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

20:34.599 --> 20:36.768
...for endangerment to life and
the destruction of property.

20:36.868 --> 20:40.038
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

20:40.138 --> 20:43.408
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

20:43.508 --> 20:47.111
I picked this guy up a while back for
petty theft. He's got a code name.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.246
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

20:48.346 --> 20:50.214
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

20:50.314 --> 20:52.016
Just relax, pal.

20:52.116 --> 20:54.675
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.777
Fascists.

21:10.468 --> 21:14.238
Ronan is destroying Xandarian
outposts throughout the galaxy.

21:14.338 --> 21:18.206
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.179
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.
What more do you want?

21:21.279 --> 21:25.616
At least a statement from the Kree Empire
saying that they condemn his actions.

21:25.716 --> 21:29.721
He is slaughtering children.
Families.

21:29.821 --> 21:34.681
That is your business. Now,
I have other matters to attend to.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.127
Prick.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.365
Well, some good news.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.901
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

21:44.001 --> 21:48.272
Gamora. Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

21:48.372 --> 21:51.209
The adopted daughter of
the Mad Titan, Thanos.

21:51.309 --> 21:54.479
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

21:54.579 --> 21:57.849
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

21:57.949 --> 22:02.320
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

22:02.420 --> 22:03.788
The result of illegal genetic

22:03.888 --> 22:06.991
and cybernetic experiments
on a lower life form.

22:07.091 --> 22:09.160
What the hell?

22:09.260 --> 22:10.828
They call it "Groot."

22:10.928 --> 22:13.398
A humanoid plant that's
been travelling recently

22:13.498 --> 22:17.126
as 89P13's personal
houseplantlmuscle.

22:18.169 --> 22:20.972
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

22:21.072 --> 22:24.142
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

22:24.242 --> 22:26.077
led by Yondu Udonta.

22:26.177 --> 22:27.678
I'm sorry.

22:27.778 --> 22:30.748
I didn't know how this machine worked.

22:30.848 --> 22:33.351
What a bunch of a-holes.

22:33.451 --> 22:36.385
Transport all four to the Kyln.

22:38.789 --> 22:42.193
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

22:42.293 --> 22:45.863
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

22:45.963 --> 22:49.834
But, hey, that's not my problem.
I ain't gonna be here long.

22:49.934 --> 22:53.404
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

22:53.504 --> 22:56.074
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise, me and Groot

22:56.174 --> 22:58.009
would be collecting
that bounty right now,

22:58.109 --> 23:01.145
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

23:01.245 --> 23:03.381
I've had a lot of folks try
to kill me over the years.

23:03.481 --> 23:06.284
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

23:06.384 --> 23:07.452
Hold.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.454
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

23:09.554 --> 23:10.855
It's what you are, stupid.

23:10.955 --> 23:13.991
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

23:14.091 --> 23:16.661
So, this Orb has a real
shiny blue suitcase,

23:16.761 --> 23:20.253
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.799
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

23:21.899 --> 23:23.568
So what? What's the Orb?

23:23.668 --> 23:25.870
I have no words for an honorless thief.

23:25.970 --> 23:29.474
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.442
Yeah, I know who you are.

23:31.542 --> 23:35.213
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.815
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

23:37.915 --> 23:40.315
Yeah, you said that.

23:40.585 --> 23:44.922
I wasn't retrieving the Orb
for Ronan. I was betraying him.

23:45.022 --> 23:47.490
I had an agreement to
sell it to a third party.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.394
I am Groot.

23:50.494 --> 23:54.732
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

23:54.832 --> 23:57.001
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

23:57.101 --> 23:59.303
Well, he don't know talking
good like me and you.

23:59.403 --> 24:03.474
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

24:03.574 --> 24:05.276
Exclusively in that order.

24:05.376 --> 24:08.071
I tell you what, that's gonna
wear real thin, real fast.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.872
Hey. Put that away.

24:12.550 --> 24:13.818
Hey!

24:13.918 --> 24:16.254
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

24:16.354 --> 24:20.452
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

24:23.594 --> 24:28.564
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.
That song belongs to me!

25:47.878 --> 25:51.148
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

25:51.248 --> 25:53.784
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

25:53.884 --> 25:58.582
You're scum! You're scum!

26:01.092 --> 26:02.293
It's like I said,

26:02.393 --> 26:04.228
she's got a rep.

26:04.328 --> 26:06.297
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

26:06.397 --> 26:08.466
to Ronan and his goons.

26:08.566 --> 26:09.834
She'll last a day, tops.

26:09.934 --> 26:11.502
Murderer!

26:11.602 --> 26:13.137
The guards will protect her, right?

26:13.237 --> 26:15.506
They're here to stop us from getting out.

26:15.606 --> 26:17.575
They don't care what we
do to each other inside.

26:17.675 --> 26:21.212
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

26:21.312 --> 26:25.407
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

26:26.016 --> 26:28.886
Check out the new meat.

26:28.986 --> 26:32.723
I'm gonna slather you
up in Gunavian jelly,

26:32.823 --> 26:34.585
and go to town...

26:38.763 --> 26:40.992
Let's make something clear.

26:41.699 --> 26:45.225
This one here is our booty!

26:45.436 --> 26:47.733
You wanna get to him,

26:47.872 --> 26:50.067
you go through us!

26:50.408 --> 26:53.110
Or, more accurately,

26:53.210 --> 26:56.110
we go through you.

27:05.656 --> 27:07.919
I'm with them.

27:09.026 --> 27:11.118
I hate you.

27:11.462 --> 27:14.453
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

27:26.677 --> 27:28.201
You're dead!

27:28.312 --> 27:29.779
Dead!

27:55.573 --> 27:57.341
Take her down to the showers.

27:57.441 --> 28:00.739
It'll be easier to clean
up the blood down there.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.719
Quill, where you going?

28:15.593 --> 28:17.082
Quill.

28:17.528 --> 28:18.995
Quill!

28:19.530 --> 28:23.033
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

28:23.133 --> 28:25.269
for your crimes against the galaxy.

28:25.369 --> 28:27.029
You dare?

28:32.743 --> 28:35.074
You know who I am, yes?

28:35.379 --> 28:36.680
You're Drax.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.916
The Destroyer.

28:39.016 --> 28:40.017
Quill!

28:40.117 --> 28:42.086
And you know why they call me this.

28:42.186 --> 28:45.211
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

28:45.422 --> 28:48.692
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

28:48.792 --> 28:51.226
and my daughter, Camaria.

28:51.562 --> 28:53.791
He slaughtered them where they stood.

28:54.331 --> 28:56.066
And he laughed!

28:56.166 --> 28:57.134
Quill?

28:57.234 --> 28:58.792
Her life

28:59.136 --> 29:01.570
is not yours to take.

29:02.573 --> 29:05.564
He killed my family.

29:05.809 --> 29:07.435
I shall kill one of his in return.

29:08.245 --> 29:10.906
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

29:17.321 --> 29:19.152
Quill! What are you doing?

29:19.256 --> 29:22.953
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

29:32.102 --> 29:34.263
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

29:35.806 --> 29:38.509
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

29:38.609 --> 29:41.145
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

29:41.245 --> 29:43.414
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

29:43.514 --> 29:45.311
I don't think this is the
best way to go about it.

29:45.516 --> 29:48.652
Are you not the man this
wench attempted to kill?

29:48.752 --> 29:51.121
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

29:51.221 --> 29:54.792
Look, this is from a
smoking-hot Rajak girl.

29:54.892 --> 29:58.128
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like
me skipping out on her at sunrise.

29:58.228 --> 30:00.798
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

30:00.898 --> 30:04.068
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

30:04.168 --> 30:07.571
I was trying to get information.
You ever see an A'askavariian?

30:07.671 --> 30:09.540
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.335
If you think I'm seriously
interested in that, then...

30:12.843 --> 30:15.868
You don't care. But here's the point.

30:17.114 --> 30:20.412
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

30:20.618 --> 30:22.210
And when he does,

30:22.353 --> 30:24.650
that's when you...

30:25.189 --> 30:28.158
Why would I put my
finger on his throat?

30:28.258 --> 30:29.782
What?

30:31.528 --> 30:32.596
No, it's a symbol.

30:32.696 --> 30:37.368
This is a symbol for
you slicing his throat.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.436
I would not slice his throat.

30:39.536 --> 30:42.306
I would cut his head clean off.

30:42.406 --> 30:44.508
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

30:44.608 --> 30:46.143
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

30:46.243 --> 30:47.678
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:47.778 --> 30:49.905
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

30:51.548 --> 30:55.017
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

30:55.252 --> 30:58.084
Don't do his work for him.

31:11.001 --> 31:13.469
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

31:14.138 --> 31:16.307
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

31:16.407 --> 31:19.543
I could care less whether
you live or whether you die.

31:19.643 --> 31:22.805
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

31:22.913 --> 31:24.214
You know where to sell my Orb.

31:24.314 --> 31:27.009
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

31:27.785 --> 31:29.309
My friend Rocket, here,

31:29.420 --> 31:31.182
has escaped 22 prisons.

31:31.355 --> 31:32.523
We're getting out.

31:32.623 --> 31:35.593
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

31:35.693 --> 31:39.788
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

31:40.698 --> 31:41.966
Four billion units.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.901
- What?
- Holy shit.

31:44.001 --> 31:48.028
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

31:48.338 --> 31:49.964
If you free us,

31:51.475 --> 31:54.745
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll
split the profit between the three of us.

31:54.845 --> 31:56.914
I am Groot.

31:57.014 --> 31:58.082
Four of us.

31:58.182 --> 32:01.751
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per frickin' usual.

32:03.120 --> 32:06.123
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

32:06.223 --> 32:08.350
We know only that
she has been captured.

32:08.892 --> 32:10.961
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

32:11.061 --> 32:15.499
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

32:15.599 --> 32:18.202
Look, your partnership with Thanos

32:18.302 --> 32:20.497
is at risk.

32:20.971 --> 32:24.998
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

32:30.347 --> 32:34.151
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

32:34.251 --> 32:35.753
and yet you summon me.

32:35.853 --> 32:37.755
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.923
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

32:40.023 --> 32:41.892
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

32:41.992 --> 32:44.762
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

32:44.862 --> 32:46.664
You are the one here with
nothing to show for it.

32:46.764 --> 32:50.868
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

32:50.968 --> 32:52.302
Lower your tone!

32:52.402 --> 32:53.869
I may be your...

33:01.612 --> 33:05.980
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

33:06.650 --> 33:10.654
The only matter I do not
take seriously, boy,

33:10.754 --> 33:12.482
is you.

33:12.756 --> 33:15.325
Your politics bore me.

33:15.425 --> 33:18.495
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

33:18.595 --> 33:23.759
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

33:25.803 --> 33:28.839
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

33:28.939 --> 33:31.202
if you bring me the Orb.

33:31.642 --> 33:34.633
But return to me again empty-handed,

33:34.745 --> 33:38.112
and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.

33:40.984 --> 33:43.349
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

33:45.189 --> 33:48.385
This is one fight you won't win.

33:49.126 --> 33:51.287
Let's head to the Kyln.

33:59.369 --> 34:02.473
If we're gonna get out of here, we're
gonna need to get into that watchtower.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.700
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

34:05.175 --> 34:09.780
The guards wear security bands to
control their ins and outs. I need one.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.315
Leave it to me.

34:11.415 --> 34:14.218
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.053
- His leg?
- Yeah.

34:16.153 --> 34:18.655
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

34:18.755 --> 34:19.757
All right.

34:19.857 --> 34:24.161
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

34:24.261 --> 34:26.230
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

34:26.330 --> 34:30.467
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

34:30.567 --> 34:32.703
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

34:32.803 --> 34:34.204
How are we supposed to do that?

34:34.304 --> 34:36.573
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

34:36.673 --> 34:38.308
So, maybe you can work
out some sort of trade.

34:38.408 --> 34:39.543
You must be joking.

34:39.643 --> 34:41.411
No, I really heard they
find you attractive.

34:41.511 --> 34:43.113
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

34:43.213 --> 34:45.616
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

34:45.716 --> 34:48.485
It's impossible to get up
there without being seen.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.789
I got one plan, and that plan
requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

34:51.889 --> 34:53.481
so figure it out!

34:54.391 --> 34:56.326
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

34:56.426 --> 34:59.997
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

35:00.097 --> 35:02.466
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

35:02.566 --> 35:08.702
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,
so you definitely need to get that last.

35:13.944 --> 35:16.079
Or we could just get
it first and improvise.

35:16.179 --> 35:18.704
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

35:30.360 --> 35:34.398
Prisoner, drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

35:34.498 --> 35:36.829
or we will open fire.

35:42.406 --> 35:44.541
I am

35:44.641 --> 35:47.411
Groot!

35:47.511 --> 35:49.342
Fire!

36:01.458 --> 36:04.256
All prisoners return to
your sleeping areas.

36:09.466 --> 36:10.801
You idiot!

36:10.901 --> 36:14.097
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

36:19.876 --> 36:21.511
The animal is in control.

36:21.611 --> 36:24.045
Fire on my command!

36:43.000 --> 36:44.865
Creepy little beast!

36:50.941 --> 36:54.467
Oh, yeah.

37:05.989 --> 37:08.252
You need my what?

37:23.940 --> 37:25.542
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

37:25.642 --> 37:27.077
It's internally wired.

37:27.177 --> 37:29.269
I'll figure something out.

37:32.349 --> 37:33.917
Drop the leg!

37:34.017 --> 37:37.077
Drop the leg and move
back to your cell!

37:51.535 --> 37:53.332
Rocket!

37:55.672 --> 37:58.504
Move to the watchtower!

38:29.039 --> 38:30.528
You!

38:31.074 --> 38:33.132
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

38:34.077 --> 38:36.636
It was one time, man.

38:37.981 --> 38:40.972
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

39:02.906 --> 39:04.839
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.998
Why is this one here?

39:07.110 --> 39:09.646
We promised him he could stay by
your side until he kills your boss.

39:09.746 --> 39:12.682
I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

39:12.782 --> 39:14.510
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

39:14.851 --> 39:17.654
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

39:17.754 --> 39:19.456
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

39:19.556 --> 39:22.459
Was it funny? Wait, what did
he look like hopping around?

39:22.559 --> 39:24.959
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

39:27.397 --> 39:28.955
How are we going to leave?

39:30.600 --> 39:33.937
Well, he's got a plan. Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

39:34.037 --> 39:35.639
I have a plan! I have a plan!

39:35.739 --> 39:39.076
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

39:39.176 --> 39:42.446
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.480
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

39:45.815 --> 39:46.917
It's just a metaphor, dude.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.886
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

39:49.986 --> 39:51.688
Nothing goes over my head.

39:51.788 --> 39:55.348
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

39:55.559 --> 39:59.825
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

40:05.602 --> 40:07.364
Those are some big guns.

40:08.205 --> 40:09.831
On my command!

40:10.307 --> 40:11.774
Number one!

40:13.276 --> 40:16.139
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
- Hold on!

40:17.247 --> 40:19.476
Number two!

40:19.916 --> 40:24.020
I recognize this animal. We'd roast
them over a flame pit as children.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.723
- Their flesh was quite delicious.
- Not helping!

40:26.823 --> 40:28.290
Number three!

40:33.997 --> 40:37.033
All fire on my command!

40:37.133 --> 40:38.602
Three!

40:38.702 --> 40:40.237
Two!

40:40.337 --> 40:41.963
One!

40:55.852 --> 40:57.721
He turned off the artificial gravity,

40:57.821 --> 41:00.255
everywhere but in here.

41:38.495 --> 41:40.860
I told you I had a plan.

42:03.086 --> 42:04.814
That was a pretty good plan.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.200
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.970
It's the Milano, the orange and
blue one over in the corner.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.871
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

42:21.971 --> 42:24.439
That's rude! They folded yours.

42:32.282 --> 42:34.284
The Orb's there. Let's go.

42:34.384 --> 42:36.953
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

42:37.053 --> 42:39.122
That bastard didn't put it back.

42:39.222 --> 42:41.825
- Put what back?
- Here.

42:41.925 --> 42:43.627
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.296
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

42:46.396 --> 42:47.731
Go.

42:47.831 --> 42:49.559
Go!

43:09.352 --> 43:11.717
My neck!

43:15.925 --> 43:17.560
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

43:17.660 --> 43:19.596
He declined to share that
information with me.

43:19.696 --> 43:21.163
Well, screw this, then!

43:21.498 --> 43:25.068
I ain't waiting around for some humie with
a death wish. You got the Orb, right?

43:25.168 --> 43:27.226
Yes.

43:49.392 --> 43:52.095
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

43:52.195 --> 43:53.163
No!

43:53.263 --> 43:55.731
We're not leaving without the Orb.

44:03.907 --> 44:05.669
Behold.

44:12.715 --> 44:14.818
This one shows spirit.

44:14.918 --> 44:17.854
He shall make a keen ally in
the battle against Ronan.

44:17.954 --> 44:20.888
Companion, what were you retrieving?

44:26.596 --> 44:28.586
You're an imbecile.

44:38.775 --> 44:40.276
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

44:40.376 --> 44:42.979
You can't take apart my
ship without asking me!

44:43.079 --> 44:44.914
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

44:45.014 --> 44:45.982
It's a bomb.

44:46.082 --> 44:47.150
- A bomb?
- Yup.

44:47.250 --> 44:48.952
And you leave it lying around?

44:49.052 --> 44:50.653
I was gonna put it in a box.

44:50.753 --> 44:51.855
What's a box gonna do?

44:51.955 --> 44:54.157
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

44:54.257 --> 44:55.258
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

44:55.358 --> 44:57.325
- Shut up.
- Hey!

44:58.127 --> 44:59.229
What is that?

44:59.329 --> 45:02.432
That's for if things get really hardcore.

45:02.532 --> 45:03.767
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.402
No one's blowing up moons.

45:05.502 --> 45:07.670
You just wanna suck the
joy out of everything.

45:07.770 --> 45:10.295
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

45:10.406 --> 45:13.176
We're heading in the
right direction. For now.

45:13.276 --> 45:15.812
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

45:15.912 --> 45:17.414
And how much do you trust me?

45:17.514 --> 45:20.949
I'd trust you a lot more if
you told me what this was.

45:21.417 --> 45:24.387
Because I'm guessing it's
some kind of weapon.

45:24.487 --> 45:25.789
I don't know what it is.

45:25.889 --> 45:28.224
If it's a weapon, we should
use it against Ronan.

45:28.324 --> 45:30.260
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.428
Or just you, murderess!

45:31.528 --> 45:33.196
I let you live once, princess!

45:33.296 --> 45:35.398
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

45:35.498 --> 45:39.525
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

45:39.802 --> 45:43.373
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

45:43.473 --> 45:45.675
I have no interest in money.

45:45.775 --> 45:47.469
Great.

45:48.311 --> 45:51.871
That means more money
for the three of us.

45:54.083 --> 45:57.253
For the four of us. Partners.

45:57.353 --> 46:01.046
We have an agreement, but I would
never be partners with the likes of you.

46:01.457 --> 46:03.618
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

46:04.260 --> 46:07.957
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

46:12.135 --> 46:14.125
She has no idea.

46:14.270 --> 46:16.239
If I had a black light,

46:16.339 --> 46:19.307
the place would look like a
Jackson Pollock painting.

46:19.475 --> 46:21.636
You got issues, Quill.

46:28.952 --> 46:32.979
I swear. I don't know where
they went! I swear.

46:33.556 --> 46:35.959
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

46:36.059 --> 46:37.494
Yeah.

46:37.594 --> 46:41.831
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a
fleet to defend the prison.

46:41.931 --> 46:46.369
Well, then, send Necrocraft to
every corner of the quadrant.

46:46.469 --> 46:49.939
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

46:50.039 --> 46:53.541
- And this place?
- The Nova can't know what we're after.

46:54.577 --> 46:56.942
Cleanse it!

46:59.349 --> 47:01.784
Do you got any other cute
little buggers like this one?

47:01.884 --> 47:05.889
I like to stick 'em all in a
row on my control console.

47:05.989 --> 47:08.091
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

47:08.191 --> 47:10.326
He's being fully serious.

47:10.426 --> 47:13.121
In that case, I can show you...

47:13.229 --> 47:15.598
But first, you gonna tell
me what this Orb is,

47:15.698 --> 47:18.359
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

47:18.501 --> 47:20.303
And then you gonna tell me,

47:20.403 --> 47:22.539
who out there might wanna buy it.

47:22.639 --> 47:25.801
Sir, the high-end community is a...

47:28.244 --> 47:30.143
The high-end community is a...

47:30.413 --> 47:31.881
It's a tight-knit...

47:31.981 --> 47:33.249
Tight-knit...

47:33.349 --> 47:35.544
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

47:36.319 --> 47:38.154
I cannot possibly betray

47:38.254 --> 47:40.415
the confidentiality of my buyers!

47:51.134 --> 47:53.966
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

47:57.140 --> 47:58.541
Carina.

47:58.641 --> 47:59.776
Yes, Master.

47:59.876 --> 48:03.313
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

48:03.413 --> 48:04.847
We do, Master.

48:04.947 --> 48:08.382
Then use them.

48:09.218 --> 48:10.620
I don't have to remind you

48:10.720 --> 48:14.190
what happened to the last
attendant who disappointed me.

48:14.290 --> 48:16.189
Do I?

48:18.294 --> 48:23.026
Chop, chop. Our guests
will be here soon.

48:26.335 --> 48:29.395
Heads up! We're inbound.

48:48.324 --> 48:49.813
What is it?

48:50.393 --> 48:52.362
It's called Knowhere.

48:52.462 --> 48:55.732
The severed head of an
ancient celestial being.

48:55.832 --> 48:58.095
Be wary headed in, rodent.

48:58.801 --> 49:02.429
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

49:26.329 --> 49:29.165
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

49:29.265 --> 49:31.834
to mine the organic
matter within the skull.

49:31.934 --> 49:34.237
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

49:34.337 --> 49:39.442
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

49:39.542 --> 49:43.179
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

49:43.279 --> 49:45.474
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

49:45.581 --> 49:48.951
Billy the Kid, Bonnie
and Clyde, John Stamos.

49:49.051 --> 49:50.553
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

49:50.653 --> 49:52.142
Yeah, you should.

49:53.122 --> 49:54.157
Excuse me.

49:54.257 --> 49:57.089
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

50:04.066 --> 50:06.158
Get out of here.

50:10.873 --> 50:13.276
Your buyer's in there?

50:13.376 --> 50:15.278
We are to wait here
for his representative.

50:15.378 --> 50:16.879
Get out of here!

50:16.979 --> 50:19.215
This is no respectable establishment.

50:19.315 --> 50:21.840
What do you expect
us to do while we wait?

50:23.152 --> 50:24.744
Yes! Yes!

50:33.296 --> 50:35.195
Yahoo!

50:41.704 --> 50:43.539
My Orloni has won,

50:43.639 --> 50:45.902
as I won at all things!

50:46.108 --> 50:48.845
Now, let's put more of
this liquid into our bodies.

50:48.945 --> 50:53.313
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

50:54.450 --> 50:56.319
Man, you wouldn't believe what
they charge for fuel out here.

50:56.419 --> 51:00.857
- I might actually lose money on this job.
- My connection is making us wait.

51:00.957 --> 51:04.994
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

51:05.094 --> 51:10.426
Where yours is more,
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

51:11.200 --> 51:14.359
- My father didn't stress diplomacy.
- Thanos?

51:15.671 --> 51:17.468
He's not my father.

51:18.307 --> 51:22.539
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

51:23.079 --> 51:27.483
He tortured me,
turned me into a weapon.

51:27.583 --> 51:31.621
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

51:31.721 --> 51:34.155
I couldn't stand by and...

51:38.594 --> 51:41.028
Why would you risk your life for this?

51:42.665 --> 51:44.689
My mother gave it to me.

51:46.269 --> 51:49.005
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

51:49.105 --> 51:50.473
I happened to have it on me,

51:50.573 --> 51:52.904
when I was...

51:53.175 --> 51:55.472
The day that she...

51:57.413 --> 51:59.642
You know, when I left Earth.

52:00.082 --> 52:01.384
What do you do with it?

52:01.484 --> 52:05.221
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

52:05.321 --> 52:09.992
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

52:10.092 --> 52:11.360
Really?

52:11.460 --> 52:15.665
On my planet, there's a
legend about people like you.

52:15.765 --> 52:17.300
It's called

52:17.400 --> 52:18.701
Footloose.

52:18.801 --> 52:22.872
And in it, a great hero

52:22.972 --> 52:24.700
named Kevin Bacon,

52:25.141 --> 52:30.305
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

52:31.047 --> 52:33.412
It's the greatest thing there is.

52:33.816 --> 52:35.451
Who put the sticks up their butts?

52:35.551 --> 52:37.019
What? No, that's just a...

52:37.119 --> 52:38.988
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

52:39.088 --> 52:41.749
people use.

52:59.809 --> 53:02.470
The melody is pleasant!

53:19.095 --> 53:21.330
- No!
- What the hell?

53:21.430 --> 53:22.832
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

53:22.932 --> 53:26.235
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

53:26.335 --> 53:28.537
Your pelvic sorcery!

53:28.637 --> 53:30.502
That is not what is happening here.

53:35.111 --> 53:37.442
No.

53:46.222 --> 53:47.857
Stop it!

53:47.957 --> 53:49.292
What are you doing?

53:49.392 --> 53:52.528
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

53:52.628 --> 53:54.597
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

53:54.697 --> 53:57.099
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

53:57.199 --> 53:59.368
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

53:59.468 --> 54:01.537
You just wanna laugh at
me like everyone else!

54:01.637 --> 54:04.240
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

54:04.340 --> 54:07.109
He thinks I'm some
stupid thing! He does!

54:07.209 --> 54:09.612
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

54:09.712 --> 54:11.781
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

54:11.881 --> 54:13.883
and put back together, over and over

54:13.983 --> 54:16.252
and turned into some...

54:16.352 --> 54:17.420
Some little monster!

54:17.520 --> 54:19.488
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

54:19.588 --> 54:21.757
He called me "vermin"!

54:21.857 --> 54:24.527
She called me "rodent"!

54:24.627 --> 54:25.962
Let's see if you can laugh

54:26.062 --> 54:29.198
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

54:29.298 --> 54:33.102
No, no, no, no!
Four billion units! Rocket!

54:33.202 --> 54:37.496
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one
more lousy night and you're rich.

54:45.681 --> 54:48.031
Fine. But I can't promise,

54:48.132 --> 54:50.686
when all this is over I'm not gonna
kill every last one of you jerks.

54:50.786 --> 54:54.744
See? That's exactly why none
of you have any friends!

54:54.890 --> 54:57.526
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

54:57.626 --> 55:01.630
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

55:01.730 --> 55:04.198
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

55:06.135 --> 55:08.237
- Drax!
- Let him go.

55:08.337 --> 55:09.997
We don't need him.

55:12.108 --> 55:14.043
Milady Gamora.

55:14.143 --> 55:16.406
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

55:22.251 --> 55:24.553
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

55:24.653 --> 55:27.951
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

55:28.190 --> 55:31.090
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

55:37.299 --> 55:38.901
I present to you,

55:39.001 --> 55:43.096
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

55:56.452 --> 55:59.045
Oh, my dear Gamora.

55:59.388 --> 56:01.891
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

56:01.991 --> 56:04.894
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

56:04.994 --> 56:07.928
We have what we discussed.

56:08.330 --> 56:13.035
What is that thing there?

56:13.135 --> 56:15.296
I am Groot.

56:18.941 --> 56:20.643
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

56:20.743 --> 56:22.642
Sir...

56:22.912 --> 56:26.215
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

56:26.315 --> 56:29.251
At the moment of your death, of course.

56:29.351 --> 56:30.653
I am Groot.

56:30.753 --> 56:33.522
Why, so he could turn
you into a frickin' chair?

56:33.622 --> 56:35.089
That's your pet?

56:35.958 --> 56:38.050
- His what?
- Tivan.

56:38.194 --> 56:42.031
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

56:42.131 --> 56:44.233
Very well, then.

56:44.333 --> 56:47.301
Let us see what you brought.

57:00.507 --> 57:03.310
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

57:03.410 --> 57:07.209
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

57:08.348 --> 57:11.585
You shall send a message for me.

57:11.685 --> 57:13.618
Oh, my new friends.

57:14.487 --> 57:17.691
Before creation itself,

57:17.791 --> 57:19.952
there were six singularities.

57:21.761 --> 57:25.532
Then the universe
exploded into existence,

57:25.632 --> 57:27.734
and the remnants of these systems

57:27.834 --> 57:31.735
were forged into concentrated ingots.

57:32.005 --> 57:34.769
Infinity Stones.

57:35.475 --> 57:37.010
These stones, it seems,

57:37.110 --> 57:38.979
can only be brandished

57:39.079 --> 57:42.616
by beings of extraordinary strength.

57:42.716 --> 57:44.205
Observe.

57:46.987 --> 57:52.793
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

57:52.893 --> 57:56.851
like wheat in a field.

57:57.898 --> 58:00.628
There's a little pee coming
out of me right now.

58:00.967 --> 58:02.269
Once, for a moment,

58:02.369 --> 58:06.473
a group was able to share the
energy amongst themselves,

58:06.573 --> 58:10.008
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

58:15.715 --> 58:17.876
Beautiful.

58:19.219 --> 58:22.153
Beyond compare.

58:23.857 --> 58:27.986
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

58:29.429 --> 58:30.897
How would you like to get paid?

58:30.997 --> 58:33.488
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

58:34.467 --> 58:36.025
Very well, then.

58:41.174 --> 58:42.776
Carina.

58:42.876 --> 58:44.343
Stand back.

58:44.511 --> 58:47.214
I will no longer be your slave!

58:47.314 --> 58:49.247
No!

59:36.096 --> 59:37.620
What the...

59:46.607 --> 59:49.409
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

59:49.509 --> 59:53.013
- What do you still have it for?
- What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

59:53.113 --> 59:56.983
- I can't believe you had that in your purse!
- It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

59:57.083 --> 1:00:00.754
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.
There's a chance they can contain it.

1:00:00.854 --> 1:00:03.658
Are you kidding me?
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

1:00:03.759 --> 1:00:06.293
- Just give it to Ronan!
- So he can destroy the galaxy?

1:00:06.393 --> 1:00:08.194
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

1:00:08.294 --> 1:00:11.298
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

1:00:11.398 --> 1:00:13.199
Because I'm one of the
idiots who lives in it!

1:00:13.299 --> 1:00:18.071
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow
the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

1:00:18.171 --> 1:00:21.508
We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.

1:00:21.608 --> 1:00:24.440
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

1:00:24.778 --> 1:00:28.748
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

1:00:28.848 --> 1:00:32.018
who's really nice for
a whole lot of money.

1:00:32.118 --> 1:00:34.654
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

1:00:34.754 --> 1:00:37.923
You're despicable. Dishonorable.

1:00:38.091 --> 1:00:39.558
Faithless!

1:00:39.826 --> 1:00:41.816
- No.
- At last!

1:00:43.897 --> 1:00:46.466
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

1:00:46.566 --> 1:00:48.727
You called Ronan?

1:00:53.139 --> 1:00:56.631
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

1:00:57.343 --> 1:00:59.902
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

1:01:03.383 --> 1:01:05.785
Ronan the Accuser!

1:01:05.885 --> 1:01:08.421
You are the one who
transmitted the message?

1:01:08.521 --> 1:01:10.283
You killed my wife.

1:01:10.757 --> 1:01:13.020
You killed my daughter!

1:01:20.066 --> 1:01:24.332
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

1:01:29.509 --> 1:01:33.308
It is Gamora. She is
escaping with the Orb.

1:01:41.621 --> 1:01:43.289
No!

1:01:43.389 --> 1:01:44.856
Nebula,

1:01:45.225 --> 1:01:47.317
retrieve the Orb.

1:02:03.376 --> 1:02:05.741
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

1:02:05.979 --> 1:02:07.707
Bring it down!

1:02:35.842 --> 1:02:39.045
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

1:02:39.145 --> 1:02:41.581
How? We've got no
weaponry on these things.

1:02:41.681 --> 1:02:43.516
These pods are industrial grade.

1:02:43.616 --> 1:02:44.818
They're nearly indestructible.

1:02:44.918 --> 1:02:47.520
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:49.644
That's not what I'm saying.

1:03:37.704 --> 1:03:39.831
Let me borrow your ride.

1:04:12.171 --> 1:04:14.434
I don't recall killing your family.

1:04:17.277 --> 1:04:21.144
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

1:04:37.297 --> 1:04:40.595
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

1:04:40.767 --> 1:04:42.234
I have to head out.

1:04:44.270 --> 1:04:46.704
Wait! These things aren't
meant to go out there.

1:04:53.279 --> 1:04:55.610
You are a disappointment, sister.

1:04:55.948 --> 1:04:58.348
Of all our siblings,

1:04:58.718 --> 1:05:00.620
I hated you least.

1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:01.988
Nebula, please.

1:05:02.088 --> 1:05:04.023
If Ronan gets this stone

1:05:04.123 --> 1:05:06.318
- he'll kill us all.
- Not all.

1:05:07.593 --> 1:05:09.720
You will already be dead.

1:06:03.783 --> 1:06:07.218
Ronan, it is done.

1:06:09.822 --> 1:06:11.311
Quill, come on.

1:06:11.424 --> 1:06:13.960
Her body mods should keep her
alive a couple more minutes,

1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:16.129
but there's nothing we can do for her.

1:06:16.229 --> 1:06:17.797
These pods aren't
meant to be out here.

1:06:17.897 --> 1:06:20.763
In a second, we're gonna
be in the same boat.

1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:30.570
Damn it.

1:06:31.444 --> 1:06:32.945
Quill?

1:06:33.045 --> 1:06:35.081
Yondu! Yondu.

1:06:35.181 --> 1:06:36.215
This is Quill!

1:06:36.315 --> 1:06:39.986
- My coordinates are 227 K324.
- Quill.

1:06:40.086 --> 1:06:41.321
Quill, what are you doing?

1:06:41.421 --> 1:06:42.922
Just outside Knowhere.

1:06:43.022 --> 1:06:45.615
If you're there, come get me.

1:06:45.858 --> 1:06:47.825
I'm all yours.

1:06:56.803 --> 1:06:59.237
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

1:07:00.373 --> 1:07:02.775
Get back into your pod!

1:07:02.875 --> 1:07:06.401
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

1:07:07.146 --> 1:07:09.248
You'll die in seconds!

1:07:09.348 --> 1:07:10.940
Quill.

1:08:11.544 --> 1:08:13.705
Quill?

1:08:14.881 --> 1:08:16.814
What happened?

1:08:17.517 --> 1:08:20.008
I saw you out there.

1:08:20.987 --> 1:08:23.921
I don't know what came over me.

1:08:24.423 --> 1:08:26.686
But I couldn't let you die.

1:08:29.061 --> 1:08:31.961
I found something inside of myself.

1:08:32.532 --> 1:08:34.167
Something

1:08:34.267 --> 1:08:36.667
incredibly heroic.

1:08:37.970 --> 1:08:40.573
I mean, not to brag,

1:08:40.673 --> 1:08:41.941
but, objectively...

1:08:42.041 --> 1:08:43.530
Where's the Orb?

1:08:44.944 --> 1:08:47.246
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

1:08:47.346 --> 1:08:48.835
What?

1:08:51.117 --> 1:08:54.017
Welcome home, Peter.

1:09:16.442 --> 1:09:19.672
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

1:09:20.546 --> 1:09:22.849
Quill just got himself captured.

1:09:22.949 --> 1:09:27.320
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:29.114
take on a frickin' army!

1:09:30.423 --> 1:09:32.083
You're right.

1:09:34.327 --> 1:09:36.886
I was a fool.

1:09:38.898 --> 1:09:41.059
All the anger,

1:09:41.267 --> 1:09:43.564
all the rage,

1:09:46.272 --> 1:09:49.036
was just to cover my loss.

1:09:57.183 --> 1:09:59.981
"My wife and child are dead."

1:10:01.053 --> 1:10:03.322
I don't care if it's mean!

1:10:03.422 --> 1:10:05.753
Everybody's got dead people.

1:10:05.958 --> 1:10:07.693
It's no excuse to get everybody else

1:10:07.793 --> 1:10:10.158
dead along the way!

1:10:13.532 --> 1:10:16.269
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

1:10:16.369 --> 1:10:19.572
The only chance we got is to get
to the other side of the universe

1:10:19.672 --> 1:10:21.641
as fast as we can and maybe,

1:10:21.741 --> 1:10:26.837
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

1:10:28.848 --> 1:10:30.249
I am Groot.

1:10:30.349 --> 1:10:32.718
Save them? How?

1:10:32.818 --> 1:10:35.655
I am Groot.

1:10:35.755 --> 1:10:38.391
I know they're the only
friends that we ever had,

1:10:38.491 --> 1:10:41.294
but there's an army of
Ravagers around them.

1:10:41.394 --> 1:10:43.452
And there's only two of us!

1:10:44.030 --> 1:10:45.758
Three.

1:10:54.373 --> 1:10:56.676
You're making me

1:10:56.776 --> 1:10:58.411
beat... up

1:10:58.511 --> 1:10:59.978
grass!

1:11:02.048 --> 1:11:04.243
The Orb is in my possession,

1:11:04.884 --> 1:11:06.452
as I promised.

1:11:06.552 --> 1:11:08.187
Bring it to me.

1:11:08.287 --> 1:11:12.052
Yes, that was our agreement.

1:11:12.324 --> 1:11:14.060
Bring you the Orb,

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.763
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

1:11:17.863 --> 1:11:22.468
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

1:11:22.568 --> 1:11:24.670
I wonder what use I have for you.

1:11:24.770 --> 1:11:26.505
Boy,

1:11:26.605 --> 1:11:29.471
I would reconsider your current course.

1:11:30.176 --> 1:11:32.511
Master! You cannot!

1:11:32.611 --> 1:11:35.579
Thanos is the most powerful
being in the universe.

1:11:35.715 --> 1:11:37.842
Not anymore.

1:12:00.206 --> 1:12:02.541
You call me "boy!"

1:12:02.641 --> 1:12:07.246
I will unfurl 1,000 years
of Kree justice on Xandar,

1:12:07.346 --> 1:12:10.916
and burn it to its core!

1:12:11.016 --> 1:12:13.019
Then, Thanos,

1:12:13.119 --> 1:12:15.553
I am coming for you.

1:12:17.456 --> 1:12:20.760
After Xandar, you are
going to kill my father?

1:12:20.860 --> 1:12:22.762
You dare to oppose me?

1:12:22.862 --> 1:12:24.664
You see what he has turned me into.

1:12:24.764 --> 1:12:29.496
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

1:12:29.802 --> 1:12:31.769
You betray me?

1:12:32.238 --> 1:12:33.272
Steal my money?

1:12:33.372 --> 1:12:35.274
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1:12:35.374 --> 1:12:37.510
When I picked you up as a kid,

1:12:37.610 --> 1:12:40.012
these boys wanted to eat you.

1:12:40.112 --> 1:12:42.615
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

1:12:42.715 --> 1:12:44.383
I saved your life!

1:12:44.483 --> 1:12:46.719
Will you shut up about that? God!

1:12:46.819 --> 1:12:49.121
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

1:12:49.221 --> 1:12:51.924
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

1:12:52.024 --> 1:12:55.661
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

1:12:55.761 --> 1:12:58.297
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

1:12:58.397 --> 1:12:59.955
You abducted me, man.

1:13:00.533 --> 1:13:02.835
You stole me from my
home and from my family.

1:13:02.935 --> 1:13:05.471
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

1:13:05.571 --> 1:13:06.639
You're scared

1:13:06.739 --> 1:13:08.841
because you're soft in here.

1:13:08.941 --> 1:13:10.276
Here, right here!

1:13:10.376 --> 1:13:11.444
Yondu!

1:13:11.544 --> 1:13:12.745
Listen to me.

1:13:12.845 --> 1:13:15.081
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

1:13:15.181 --> 1:13:17.116
I know what he's got, girl.

1:13:17.216 --> 1:13:19.552
Then you know we must get it back!

1:13:19.652 --> 1:13:23.122
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

1:13:23.222 --> 1:13:26.225
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

1:13:26.325 --> 1:13:28.961
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

1:13:29.061 --> 1:13:30.528
Sentiment?

1:13:31.564 --> 1:13:33.827
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1:13:38.137 --> 1:13:40.002
That's it.

1:13:40.206 --> 1:13:41.607
No!

1:13:41.707 --> 1:13:42.875
Sorry, boy.

1:13:42.975 --> 1:13:46.545
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

1:13:46.645 --> 1:13:48.373
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1:13:50.749 --> 1:13:53.052
If you kill me now,

1:13:53.152 --> 1:13:57.679
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

1:14:02.394 --> 1:14:04.293
The Stone?

1:14:04.597 --> 1:14:06.599
I hope you got something
better than that.

1:14:06.699 --> 1:14:09.793
Because ain't nobody
stealing from Ronan.

1:14:10.536 --> 1:14:11.904
We got a ringer.

1:14:12.004 --> 1:14:13.903
Is that right?

1:14:14.573 --> 1:14:17.009
She knows everything there
is to know about Ronan.

1:14:17.109 --> 1:14:18.410
His ships,

1:14:18.510 --> 1:14:20.112
his army.

1:14:20.212 --> 1:14:22.509
He's vulnerable.

1:14:22.848 --> 1:14:24.150
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

1:14:24.250 --> 1:14:28.277
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1:14:35.527 --> 1:14:37.051
Let him go!

1:14:38.330 --> 1:14:40.933
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1:14:41.033 --> 1:14:44.229
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1:14:52.044 --> 1:14:54.079
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1:14:54.179 --> 1:14:56.840
Attention, idiots.

1:14:58.484 --> 1:15:02.321
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

1:15:02.421 --> 1:15:04.190
It's a weapon of my own design.

1:15:04.290 --> 1:15:05.791
What the hell?

1:15:05.891 --> 1:15:08.661
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

1:15:08.761 --> 1:15:11.130
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

1:15:11.230 --> 1:15:13.065
A very big new one!

1:15:13.165 --> 1:15:16.435
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

1:15:16.535 --> 1:15:19.705
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

1:15:19.805 --> 1:15:21.640
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:23.809
We figured it out! We're fine!

1:15:23.909 --> 1:15:25.569
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

1:15:27.012 --> 1:15:28.647
You call that "figured it out"?

1:15:28.747 --> 1:15:31.116
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1:15:31.216 --> 1:15:32.651
You want to talk about senseless?

1:15:32.751 --> 1:15:35.020
How about trying to save
us by blowing us up?

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:37.957
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

1:15:38.057 --> 1:15:39.925
And how on earth were
they gonna turn us over

1:15:40.025 --> 1:15:41.560
when you only gave
them a count of five?

1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:45.164
We didn't have time to work
out the minutiae of the plan.

1:15:45.264 --> 1:15:47.533
This is what we get for
acting altruistically.

1:15:47.633 --> 1:15:49.802
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

1:15:49.902 --> 1:15:53.973
What's important now is we get the
Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.

1:15:54.273 --> 1:15:57.843
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's
just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

1:15:57.943 --> 1:16:01.013
- We'll figure that part out later.
- We have to stop Ronan.

1:16:01.113 --> 1:16:02.581
How?

1:16:02.681 --> 1:16:05.251
- I have a plan.
- You've got a plan?

1:16:05.351 --> 1:16:06.418
Yes.

1:16:06.519 --> 1:16:08.940
First of all, you're copying me
from when I said I had a plan.

1:16:09.041 --> 1:16:12.558
No, I'm not. People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1:16:12.658 --> 1:16:14.560
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1:16:14.660 --> 1:16:17.463
I have part of a plan!

1:16:17.563 --> 1:16:19.098
What percentage of
a plan do you have?

1:16:19.198 --> 1:16:22.401
You don't get to ask questions after
the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

1:16:22.501 --> 1:16:24.136
I just saved Quill.

1:16:24.236 --> 1:16:26.972
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

1:16:27.072 --> 1:16:29.308
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

1:16:29.408 --> 1:16:31.432
I wasn't listening. I was
thinking of something else.

1:16:32.077 --> 1:16:35.147
She's right. You don't get an opinion.
What percentage?

1:16:35.247 --> 1:16:38.479
- I don't know. Twelve percent.
- Twelve percent?

1:16:40.019 --> 1:16:41.220
That's a fake laugh.

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:43.055
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

1:16:43.155 --> 1:16:47.826
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1:16:47.926 --> 1:16:50.362
- because that is not a plan.
- It's barely a concept.

1:16:50.462 --> 1:16:53.065
- You're taking their side?
- I am Groot.

1:16:53.165 --> 1:16:56.101
So what, it's better than 11%? What the
hell does that have to do with anything?

1:16:56.201 --> 1:16:58.837
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1:16:58.937 --> 1:17:02.838
See? Groot's the only one
of you who has a clue.

1:17:07.413 --> 1:17:08.902
Guys.

1:17:09.281 --> 1:17:10.416
Come on.

1:17:10.516 --> 1:17:12.518
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1:17:12.618 --> 1:17:15.586
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1:17:16.488 --> 1:17:18.853
I need your help.

1:17:20.125 --> 1:17:22.861
I look around at us.

1:17:22.961 --> 1:17:24.450
You know what I see?

1:17:24.963 --> 1:17:26.430
Losers.

1:17:28.634 --> 1:17:30.235
I mean, like,

1:17:30.335 --> 1:17:32.271
folks who have lost stuff.

1:17:32.371 --> 1:17:34.998
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1:17:35.674 --> 1:17:37.436
Our homes,

1:17:37.709 --> 1:17:39.540
our families,

1:17:40.212 --> 1:17:42.181
normal lives.

1:17:42.281 --> 1:17:45.477
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1:17:45.851 --> 1:17:47.453
Today, it's given us something.

1:17:47.553 --> 1:17:49.154
It has given us a chance.

1:17:49.254 --> 1:17:51.051
To do what?

1:17:52.491 --> 1:17:54.253
To give a shit.

1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:56.462
For once.

1:17:56.562 --> 1:17:59.030
Not run away.

1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:03.902
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1:18:04.002 --> 1:18:07.528
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1:18:08.173 --> 1:18:11.233
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1:18:11.877 --> 1:18:14.313
it's impossible.

1:18:14.413 --> 1:18:17.177
You're asking us to die.

1:18:23.388 --> 1:18:25.719
Yeah, I guess I am.

1:18:38.103 --> 1:18:39.695
Quill.

1:18:43.408 --> 1:18:47.207
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1:18:50.782 --> 1:18:55.446
I will be grateful to
die among my friends.

1:18:59.291 --> 1:19:01.691
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1:19:02.928 --> 1:19:05.589
I will fight beside you.

1:19:06.331 --> 1:19:08.298
And in the end,

1:19:09.801 --> 1:19:12.292
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1:19:17.809 --> 1:19:21.437
I am Groot.

1:19:31.290 --> 1:19:34.987
What the hell. I don't got
that long a lifespan, anyway.

1:19:40.532 --> 1:19:43.168
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1:19:43.268 --> 1:19:45.504
We're all standing up now.

1:19:45.604 --> 1:19:49.301
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1:19:56.081 --> 1:19:57.649
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1:19:57.749 --> 1:19:59.785
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1:19:59.885 --> 1:20:03.122
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1:20:03.222 --> 1:20:04.923
All plants, animals,

1:20:05.023 --> 1:20:06.956
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1:20:07.159 --> 1:20:09.559
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1:20:12.064 --> 1:20:14.099
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1:20:14.199 --> 1:20:16.401
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1:20:16.501 --> 1:20:20.572
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1:20:20.672 --> 1:20:23.442
Won't there be hundreds of
Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1:20:23.542 --> 1:20:26.840
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1:20:32.217 --> 1:20:33.652
Once they know we're on board,

1:20:33.752 --> 1:20:37.156
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1:20:37.256 --> 1:20:39.758
Which I can disable by
dismantling the power source.

1:20:39.858 --> 1:20:41.560
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:45.129
and I'll use the Hadron
Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1:20:47.232 --> 1:20:50.702
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1:20:50.802 --> 1:20:53.238
Use these devices to contain it.

1:20:53.338 --> 1:20:55.135
If you touch it,

1:20:55.407 --> 1:20:57.204
it will kill you.

1:20:59.578 --> 1:21:02.814
I'll contact one of the Nova
officers who arrested us.

1:21:02.914 --> 1:21:06.008
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1:21:06.118 --> 1:21:09.746
There's one more thing we
need to complete the plan.

1:21:10.055 --> 1:21:11.715
That guy's eye.

1:21:12.190 --> 1:21:14.760
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:16.657
that guy's eye.

1:21:17.296 --> 1:21:20.356
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1:21:24.569 --> 1:21:27.506
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,
and will arrive in T-minus

1:21:27.606 --> 1:21:29.508
fifteen minutes.

1:21:29.608 --> 1:21:31.443
Remember, boy.

1:21:31.543 --> 1:21:33.478
At the end of all this,

1:21:33.578 --> 1:21:34.913
I get the Stone.

1:21:35.013 --> 1:21:37.913
You cross me, we kill you all.

1:22:00.105 --> 1:22:01.902
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1:22:10.949 --> 1:22:12.251
This is a terrible plan.

1:22:12.351 --> 1:22:14.910
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1:22:19.391 --> 1:22:20.858
Nova Prime.

1:22:22.060 --> 1:22:23.362
I received a transmission

1:22:23.462 --> 1:22:25.156
from one of the Ravagers.

1:22:25.263 --> 1:22:27.899
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1:22:27.999 --> 1:22:29.368
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1:22:29.468 --> 1:22:30.736
Good God.

1:22:30.836 --> 1:22:32.804
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1:22:32.904 --> 1:22:35.374
Did he say why we should believe him?

1:22:35.474 --> 1:22:37.709
He said his crew just
escaped from prison

1:22:37.809 --> 1:22:41.244
so he'd have no other reason to
risk coming to Xandar to help.

1:22:41.580 --> 1:22:43.206
He says that he's an

1:22:43.815 --> 1:22:45.117
"a-hole."

1:22:45.217 --> 1:22:46.485
But he's not,

1:22:46.585 --> 1:22:48.320
and I'm quoting him, here,

1:22:48.420 --> 1:22:50.722
"100% a dick."

1:22:50.822 --> 1:22:52.584
Do you believe him?

1:22:52.791 --> 1:22:55.827
I don't know that I believe
anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1:22:55.927 --> 1:22:59.328
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1:23:02.567 --> 1:23:04.034
Yeah.

1:23:13.678 --> 1:23:15.480
A fleet approaches.

1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:17.638
They appear to be Ravagers.

1:23:28.260 --> 1:23:29.818
Fire!

1:23:40.705 --> 1:23:41.940
Cover it down.

1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:44.405
Submerge!

1:23:56.888 --> 1:23:58.548
Rocket, hurry!

1:24:04.596 --> 1:24:05.864
All pilots, dive!

1:24:05.964 --> 1:24:07.590
They're beneath us!

1:24:15.974 --> 1:24:17.442
Evacuate the city.

1:24:17.542 --> 1:24:21.500
Our priority is to get our
people away from the battle.

1:24:28.019 --> 1:24:29.508
Forward thrust, now!

1:24:42.601 --> 1:24:44.068
Come on!

1:24:45.303 --> 1:24:47.327
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1:25:09.194 --> 1:25:10.762
Hell!

1:25:10.862 --> 1:25:12.364
I'm going down, Quill!

1:25:12.464 --> 1:25:14.266
No more games with me, boy!

1:25:14.366 --> 1:25:15.467
I'll see you

1:25:15.567 --> 1:25:17.762
at the end of this!

1:25:23.608 --> 1:25:25.473
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1:25:25.777 --> 1:25:27.972
We'll never make it up there!

1:25:42.527 --> 1:25:43.728
Peter Quill.

1:25:43.828 --> 1:25:46.264
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1:25:46.364 --> 1:25:49.734
For the record, I advised
against trusting you here.

1:25:49.834 --> 1:25:51.536
They got my "dick" message!

1:25:51.636 --> 1:25:53.262
Prove me wrong.

1:26:00.245 --> 1:26:02.576
Yes!

1:26:23.301 --> 1:26:24.859
Yes!

1:26:27.839 --> 1:26:29.966
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1:26:33.745 --> 1:26:35.313
The starboard kern has been breached!

1:26:35.413 --> 1:26:36.715
We have been boarded.

1:26:36.815 --> 1:26:38.283
Continue our approach.

1:26:38.383 --> 1:26:39.718
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1:26:39.818 --> 1:26:42.487
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1:26:42.587 --> 1:26:43.688
Seal security doors!

1:26:43.788 --> 1:26:45.277
Now!

1:26:46.591 --> 1:26:49.321
Get out of my way!

1:27:00.105 --> 1:27:01.673
Oh, man.

1:27:01.773 --> 1:27:06.211
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1:27:06.311 --> 1:27:10.611
The Dark Aster must
not reach the ground.

1:27:22.694 --> 1:27:24.320
Locked in!

1:27:24.729 --> 1:27:26.321
Locked in.

1:27:27.465 --> 1:27:28.932
We're locked in.

1:28:06.771 --> 1:28:09.364
I can barely see.

1:28:35.266 --> 1:28:37.469
When did you learn to do that?

1:28:37.569 --> 1:28:38.737
Pretty sure the answer is

1:28:38.837 --> 1:28:40.861
"I am Groot."

1:28:41.573 --> 1:28:44.541
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1:28:47.345 --> 1:28:51.149
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1:28:51.249 --> 1:28:53.944
It is pleasing to once again have

1:28:54.085 --> 1:28:55.552
friends.

1:28:56.187 --> 1:28:59.057
You, Quill, are my friend.

1:28:59.157 --> 1:29:00.425
Thanks.

1:29:00.525 --> 1:29:03.084
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1:29:04.763 --> 1:29:08.064
- And this green whore, she, too...
- You must stop!

1:29:10.502 --> 1:29:16.107
Gamora, look at what you have done.
You have always been weak.

1:29:16.207 --> 1:29:18.766
You stupid, traitorous...

1:29:23.515 --> 1:29:26.279
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1:29:26.951 --> 1:29:31.279
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut
down the power to the security doors.

1:29:38.830 --> 1:29:40.699
Yondu Udonta.

1:29:40.799 --> 1:29:44.757
Order your men to turn
on the Nova Corps.

1:30:01.085 --> 1:30:02.687
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1:30:02.787 --> 1:30:05.050
Time to die...

1:30:37.288 --> 1:30:38.777
Nebula, please.

1:30:52.837 --> 1:30:55.640
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1:30:55.740 --> 1:30:58.265
enact immolation initiative.

1:31:01.346 --> 1:31:02.847
They're dive-bombing the city!

1:31:02.947 --> 1:31:04.783
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1:31:04.883 --> 1:31:06.975
No! Hold your positions.

1:31:38.182 --> 1:31:39.651
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1:31:39.751 --> 1:31:41.386
We'll take care of the
people down here.

1:31:41.486 --> 1:31:44.113
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

1:31:46.858 --> 1:31:48.459
Star-Lord.

1:31:48.559 --> 1:31:50.026
Finally.

1:32:00.471 --> 1:32:01.995
You thief!

1:32:13.418 --> 1:32:16.716
You will never make it to Ronan.

1:32:21.993 --> 1:32:24.723
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1:32:32.904 --> 1:32:34.735
Come on!

1:33:17.115 --> 1:33:21.051
Finger to the throat means death.

1:33:26.424 --> 1:33:27.892
Metaphor.

1:33:27.992 --> 1:33:29.327
Yeah, sorta.

1:33:29.427 --> 1:33:31.053
No.

1:33:58.556 --> 1:34:00.455
Xandar!

1:34:00.658 --> 1:34:03.718
You stand accused.

1:34:04.095 --> 1:34:07.165
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1:34:07.265 --> 1:34:08.866
save you now.

1:34:08.966 --> 1:34:12.663
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1:34:36.828 --> 1:34:37.895
Rocket!

1:34:37.995 --> 1:34:40.224
Hold on, Saal, just...

1:35:06.524 --> 1:35:07.792
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1:35:07.892 --> 1:35:09.527
The city's been evacuated,

1:35:09.627 --> 1:35:12.196
but we're getting our
asses kicked down here.

1:35:12.296 --> 1:35:14.195
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1:35:38.456 --> 1:35:39.923
Nebula!

1:35:41.025 --> 1:35:43.628
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1:35:43.728 --> 1:35:45.563
You know he's crazy.

1:35:45.663 --> 1:35:47.765
I know you're both crazy.

1:35:47.865 --> 1:35:49.491
No!

1:35:51.936 --> 1:35:53.403
What the?

1:35:54.205 --> 1:35:56.195
Get out!

1:36:37.148 --> 1:36:38.615
You did it!

1:37:04.675 --> 1:37:05.943
I was mistaken.

1:37:06.043 --> 1:37:08.101
I do remember your family.

1:37:08.279 --> 1:37:10.081
Their screams were

1:37:10.181 --> 1:37:12.740
pitiful. I...

1:39:09.433 --> 1:39:10.991
No, Groot!

1:39:11.135 --> 1:39:12.236
You can't.

1:39:12.336 --> 1:39:14.269
You'll die.

1:39:14.372 --> 1:39:16.274
Why are you doing this?

1:39:16.374 --> 1:39:18.307
Why?

1:39:24.482 --> 1:39:26.350
We

1:39:26.450 --> 1:39:27.939
are

1:39:28.119 --> 1:39:30.052
Groot.

1:40:34.018 --> 1:40:36.509
I called him an idiot.

1:40:58.776 --> 1:41:01.176
You killed Groot!

1:41:04.882 --> 1:41:06.610
Behold!

1:41:07.084 --> 1:41:10.521
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1:41:10.621 --> 1:41:13.057
What fruit have they wrought?

1:41:13.157 --> 1:41:17.261
Only that my father and his father

1:41:17.361 --> 1:41:20.998
shall finally know vengeance.

1:41:21.098 --> 1:41:23.793
People of Xandar,

1:41:23.968 --> 1:41:25.770
the time has come

1:41:25.870 --> 1:41:28.739
to rejoice and renounce

1:41:28.839 --> 1:41:31.534
your paltry gods!

1:41:31.909 --> 1:41:35.708
Your salvation is at hand.

1:41:47.992 --> 1:41:49.959
Listen to these words.

1:41:58.569 --> 1:42:00.696
Now bring it down hard!

1:42:03.674 --> 1:42:05.142
What are you doing?

1:42:05.242 --> 1:42:08.267
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1:42:11.248 --> 1:42:13.113
Gamora.

1:42:13.684 --> 1:42:16.086
Subtle. Take it back.

1:42:16.186 --> 1:42:18.622
What are you doing?

1:42:18.722 --> 1:42:21.520
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1:42:37.274 --> 1:42:39.264
No!

1:43:12.776 --> 1:43:16.370
Peter! Take my hand!

1:43:21.318 --> 1:43:23.786
Take my hand, Peter.

1:43:24.254 --> 1:43:26.056
Mom.

1:43:26.156 --> 1:43:28.681
Take my hand!

1:44:22.646 --> 1:44:24.682
You're mortal!

1:44:24.782 --> 1:44:26.116
How?

1:44:26.216 --> 1:44:28.419
You said it yourself, bitch.

1:44:28.519 --> 1:44:31.351
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1:45:00.751 --> 1:45:02.419
Well, well, well.

1:45:02.519 --> 1:45:04.043
Quite the light show.

1:45:05.889 --> 1:45:08.016
Ain't this sweet.

1:45:09.126 --> 1:45:11.662
But you got some business to attend to

1:45:11.762 --> 1:45:14.662
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1:45:15.899 --> 1:45:18.135
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1:45:18.235 --> 1:45:22.339
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1:45:22.439 --> 1:45:26.668
but the only way the universe can survive
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1:45:27.044 --> 1:45:29.671
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1:45:31.482 --> 1:45:33.813
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1:45:35.052 --> 1:45:37.019
Hand it over, son.

1:45:53.403 --> 1:45:54.870
Yondu.

1:45:57.508 --> 1:46:01.239
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1:46:01.411 --> 1:46:04.345
You've seen what it does to people.

1:46:14.625 --> 1:46:17.320
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1:46:17.728 --> 1:46:20.364
It's probably good we didn't
deliver him to his dad

1:46:20.464 --> 1:46:21.465
like we was hired to do.

1:46:21.565 --> 1:46:24.761
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1:46:29.173 --> 1:46:33.200
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1:46:35.479 --> 1:46:37.776
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1:46:38.549 --> 1:46:40.676
I know.

1:46:42.085 --> 1:46:44.177
But he was about the only family I had.

1:46:46.623 --> 1:46:48.112
No.

1:46:48.926 --> 1:46:50.586
He wasn't.

1:47:38.375 --> 1:47:39.943
Why would you even know this?

1:47:40.043 --> 1:47:42.780
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.745
so we had it checked out.

1:47:45.582 --> 1:47:47.284
I'm not Terran?

1:47:47.384 --> 1:47:48.952
You are half Terran.

1:47:49.052 --> 1:47:52.756
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1:47:52.856 --> 1:47:56.627
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1:47:56.727 --> 1:48:00.756
That could be why you were able to
hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1:48:01.198 --> 1:48:02.665
Your friends have arrived.

1:48:04.101 --> 1:48:06.670
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1:48:06.770 --> 1:48:12.368
we'd like to express our profound
gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.

1:48:13.744 --> 1:48:16.513
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1:48:16.613 --> 1:48:20.377
- he has something to show you.
- Thank you, Nova Prime.

1:48:28.725 --> 1:48:33.630
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1:48:33.730 --> 1:48:34.965
Yes.

1:48:35.065 --> 1:48:37.430
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1:48:37.734 --> 1:48:40.361
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1:48:42.572 --> 1:48:45.802
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1:48:45.943 --> 1:48:48.377
We salvaged as much as we could.

1:48:51.014 --> 1:48:52.481
I...

1:48:54.017 --> 1:48:55.575
Thank you.

1:48:56.687 --> 1:48:58.755
I have a family.

1:48:58.855 --> 1:49:00.788
They're alive because of you.

1:49:05.028 --> 1:49:07.464
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1:49:07.564 --> 1:49:11.966
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1:49:12.135 --> 1:49:14.438
Question. What if I see
something that I want to take,

1:49:14.538 --> 1:49:17.207
- and it belongs to someone else?
- You will be arrested.

1:49:17.307 --> 1:49:19.910
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1:49:20.010 --> 1:49:21.812
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1:49:21.912 --> 1:49:24.648
No, I want it more, sir. Do you
understand? What are you laughing at?

1:49:24.748 --> 1:49:26.583
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1:49:26.683 --> 1:49:28.585
What if someone does
something irksome

1:49:28.685 --> 1:49:31.346
and I decide to remove his spine?

1:49:32.456 --> 1:49:34.014
That's...

1:49:34.658 --> 1:49:37.319
That's actually murder.

1:49:38.662 --> 1:49:41.265
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1:49:41.365 --> 1:49:44.663
So... also illegal.

1:49:47.804 --> 1:49:49.293
They'll be fine, Dey.

1:49:49.539 --> 1:49:50.774
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1:49:50.874 --> 1:49:52.341
You?

1:49:55.345 --> 1:49:58.780
Yeah. Me.

1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:19.290
Peter,

1:50:19.403 --> 1:50:23.202
I know these last few months
have been hard for you.

1:50:24.041 --> 1:50:26.710
But I'm going to a better place.

1:50:26.810 --> 1:50:29.313
And I will be okay.

1:50:29.413 --> 1:50:33.610
And I will always be with you.

1:50:34.851 --> 1:50:37.587
You are the light of my life.

1:50:37.687 --> 1:50:40.382
My precious son.

1:50:40.891 --> 1:50:44.292
My little Star-Lord.

1:50:44.561 --> 1:50:46.995
Love, Mom.

1:52:47.117 --> 1:52:48.985
So, what should we do next?

1:52:49.085 --> 1:52:50.552
Something good?

1:52:51.121 --> 1:52:52.622
Something bad?

1:52:52.722 --> 1:52:54.814
A bit of both?

1:52:55.992 --> 1:52:59.359
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1:53:01.164 --> 1:53:02.653
Bit of both.

2:00:26.542 --> 2:00:29.306
What do you let it lick you like that for?

2:00:30.179 --> 2:00:32.203
Gross.

2:00:34.784 --> 2:00:36.351
Yeah!

2:00:36.352 --> 2:00:38.649
But it burns going down.
