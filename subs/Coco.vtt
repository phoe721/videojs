01:09.736 --> 01:11.784
<i>Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.</i>

01:11.947 --> 01:14.746
<i>Because of something that happened
before I was even born.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:18.791
<i>See, a long time ago, there was this family.</i>

01:20.122 --> 01:21.999
<i>The</i> papá, <i>he was a musician.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:26.630
<i>He and his family would sing
and dance and count their blessings.</i>

01:27.963 --> 01:31.684
<i>But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:40.651
<i>And one day, he left with his guitar
and never returned.</i>

01:49.318 --> 01:50.695
<i>And the</i> mamá...

01:51.028 --> 01:53.622
<i>She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.</i>

01:56.199 --> 02:00.955
<i>After banishing all music from her life
she found a way...</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:02.543
<i>to provide for her daughter.</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:09.888
<i>She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.</i>

02:15.218 --> 02:20.566
<i>She could have made candy,
or fireworks, or sparkly underwear...</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:25.696
<i>for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.</i>

02:28.523 --> 02:30.571
<i>Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.</i>

02:32.152 --> 02:34.496
<i>And later, she taught her son-in-law.</i>

02:35.864 --> 02:37.741
<i>Then her grandkids got roped in.</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:42.083
<i>As her family grew, so did the business.</i>

02:43.872 --> 02:46.421
<i>Music had torn her family apart.</i>

02:47.501 --> 02:49.549
<i>But shoes held them all together.</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:55.426
<i>You see, that woman was my great-</i>
<i>great-grandmother,</i> Mamá <i>Imelda.</i>

02:56.760 --> 02:59.058
<i>She died way before I was born.</i>

02:59.596 --> 03:04.102
<i>But my family still tells her story</i>
<i>every year on</i> Día de los Muertos...

03:04.267 --> 03:05.610
<i>the Day of the Dead.</i>

03:05.727 --> 03:09.778
<i>And her little girl, she's my</i>
<i>great-grandmother,</i> Mamá <i>Coco.</i>

03:10.941 --> 03:12.238
<i>Hola, Mamá</i> Coco.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.948
How are you, Julio?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.281
<i>Actually, my name is Miguel.</i>

03:17.406 --> 03:21.036
Mamá <i>Coco has trouble remembering things.</i>

03:21.201 --> 03:25.206
<i>But it's good to talk to her anyway.
So, I tell her pretty much everything.</i>

03:25.414 --> 03:29.510
I used to run like this. But now
I run like this which is way faster.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.964
And the winner is <i>Luchadora</i> Coco!

03:34.214 --> 03:36.386
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.343
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.555
Miguel, eat your food.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.099
<i>My</i> abuelita, <i>she's</i> Mamá <i>Coco's daughter.</i>

03:43.265 --> 03:46.269
Oh, you're a twig, <i>mijo.</i> Have some more.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.436
No, <i>gracias.</i>

03:47.602 --> 03:50.731
I asked if you would like more tamales!

03:50.897 --> 03:51.944
<i>Sí?</i>

03:52.107 --> 03:54.451
That's what I thought you said!

03:54.568 --> 03:57.913
Abuelita <i>runs our house</i>
<i>just like</i> Mamá <i>Imelda did.</i>

04:00.949 --> 04:01.916
No music!

04:03.493 --> 04:04.620
No music!

04:04.786 --> 04:07.915
- <i>Y aunque la vida</i>
- No music!

04:08.248 --> 04:11.548
<i>I think we're the only family in México
who hates music.</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:15.097
<i>And my family's fine with that. But me...</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:17.349
- Be back by lunch, <i>mijo.</i>
- Love you, <i>Mamá.</i>

04:18.675 --> 04:21.019
<i>I am not like the rest of my family!</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:23.688
- <i>Hola,</i> Miguel!
- <i>Hola!</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:31.859
- <i>Muchas gracias.</i>
- <i>De nada,</i> Miguel.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.279
Hey! Dante!

04:39.780 --> 04:43.501
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.456
Fist bump!

04:45.619 --> 04:47.496
Good boy, Dante!

04:51.458 --> 04:53.961
<i>I know I'm not supposed to love music.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:57.472
<i>But it's not my fault! It's his!</i>

04:57.631 --> 05:02.228
<i>Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:07.892
Right here in this very plaza,
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

05:08.058 --> 05:11.437
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Méxican history.

05:12.187 --> 05:16.067
<i>He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:21.246
<i>But when he played music,
he made people fall in love with him.</i>

05:22.155 --> 05:23.907
<i>He starred in movies.</i>

05:24.574 --> 05:28.249
<i>He had the coolest guitar! He could fly!</i>

05:28.787 --> 05:31.126
<i>And he wrote the best songs.</i>

05:31.206 --> 05:33.083
<i>But my all-time favorite, it's...</i>

05:33.667 --> 05:36.921
- <i>Remember me
- Remember me</i>

05:37.087 --> 05:38.760
<i>Though I have to say goodbye</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:40.553
- <i>Remember me
- Remember me</i>

05:40.715 --> 05:44.436
<i>Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away</i>

05:44.594 --> 05:46.267
<i>I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

05:48.223 --> 05:51.068
<i>Each night we are apart Remember me</i>

05:51.226 --> 05:53.190
<i>Though I have to travel far</i>

05:53.270 --> 05:54.943
- <i>Remember me
- Remember me</i>

05:55.105 --> 05:57.278
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

05:57.399 --> 06:01.575
<i>Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be</i>

06:02.070 --> 06:05.620
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

06:05.782 --> 06:07.785
<i>He lived the kind of life you dream about.</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:13.965
<i>Until 1942.</i>

06:15.959 --> 06:19.008
<i>When he was crushed by a giant bell.</i>

06:19.963 --> 06:22.387
<i>I want to be just like him.</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:34.233
<i>Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
I get this feeling like we're connected.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:39.654
<i>Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.</i>

06:40.650 --> 06:42.493
If it wasn't for my family.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.955
- <i>Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.</i>
- Huh?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.241
I asked for a shoe shine not your life story.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.829
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.667
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

06:52.829 --> 06:55.833
If I were you, I'd march
right up to my family and say...

06:55.999 --> 06:58.343
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."

06:58.501 --> 07:01.880
- I could never say that.
- You are a musician, no?

07:02.339 --> 07:05.843
I don't know.
I mean, I only really play for myself.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.852
Did de la Cruz become the world's
best musician by hiding his skills?

07:11.014 --> 07:15.986
No! He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.942
<i>Mira, mira,</i> they're setting up for tonight!

07:18.480 --> 07:20.904
The music competition for <i>Día de Muertos.</i>

07:21.024 --> 07:23.527
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

07:23.693 --> 07:25.946
Uh-uh. My family would freak!

07:26.529 --> 07:29.999
Look, if you're too scared
then, well, have fun making shoes.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.620
Come on, what did de la Cruz always say?

07:34.204 --> 07:35.706
Seize your moment?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.963
Show me what you got, <i>muchacho.</i>

07:40.543 --> 07:42.136
I'll be your first audience.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.394
Miguel!

07:52.472 --> 07:53.894
- <i>Abuelita!</i>
- What are you doing here?

07:56.393 --> 07:58.020
You leave my grandson alone.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.108
<i>Doña,</i> please! I was just getting a shine.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.317
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.946
He was just showing me his guitar.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.198
Shame on you.

08:06.945 --> 08:12.076
My grandson is a sweet little
<i>angelito querido cielito.</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:16.171
He wants no part of your music,
mariachi. You keep away from him.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.261
<i>Ay, pobrecito.</i> Oh, <i>estás bien, mijo.</i>

08:25.547 --> 08:27.675
You know better than to
be here in this place!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.936
You will come home. Now.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.278
How many times have we told you?
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.780
Yes, <i>Tío</i> Berto.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.414
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Go away, you. Go!

08:50.572 --> 08:51.744
It's just Dante.

08:51.906 --> 08:56.958
Never name a street dog. They'll follow
you forever. Now, go get my shoe.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.882
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.214
<i>Ay,</i> Miguel!

09:07.297 --> 09:09.425
You know how <i>Abuelita</i> feels about the plaza.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.310
- I was just shining shoes.
- A musician's shoes!

09:14.471 --> 09:16.474
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

09:16.639 --> 09:20.269
If <i>Abuelita</i> says no more plaza,
then no more plaza.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.487
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

09:22.645 --> 09:27.117
Well, they're having this talent show.
And I thought I might...

09:27.734 --> 09:30.237
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.535
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.329
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.081
It's <i>Día de los Muertos.</i>

09:38.161 --> 09:41.336
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.296
<i>Ofrenda</i> room<i>. Vámonos.</i>

09:55.136 --> 09:56.809
Don't give me that look.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.645
<i>Día de los Muertos</i> is
the one night of the year

09:59.808 --> 10:01.651
our ancestors can come visit us.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.815
We've put their photos on the <i>ofrenda</i>
so their spirits can cross over.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.778
That is very important.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.698
If we don't put them up, they can't come.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.115
We made all this food, set out
the things they loved in life, <i>mijo.</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:18.376
All this work to bring the family together.

10:18.493 --> 10:23.668
I don't want you sneaking off to who
knows where. Where are you going?

10:23.748 --> 10:24.794
I thought we were done.

10:24.874 --> 10:29.630
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i> Being part of this family
means being here for this family.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.467
- I don't want to see you end up like...
- Like <i>Mamá</i> Coco's <i>papá?</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:36.639
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.720
But you're the one who...

10:37.804 --> 10:38.931
I was just...

10:39.013 --> 10:40.310
But... I...

10:40.390 --> 10:43.563
<i>Papá? Papá</i> is home?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.483
<i>Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:47.984
<i>Papá</i> is coming home?

10:48.064 --> 10:51.409
No, <i>Mamá.</i> It's okay. I'm here.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.162
Who are you?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.910
Rest, <i>Mamá.</i>

10:57.824 --> 11:02.830
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.
Miguel? Miguel?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.092
What are we going to do with that boy?

11:09.836 --> 11:13.056
You're right. That's just what he needs.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.659
It's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

11:42.243 --> 11:45.543
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.
Someone could hear me.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.303
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.512
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.095
<i>Perfecto!</i>

12:33.711 --> 12:35.839
<i>I have to sing. I have to play!</i>

12:36.464 --> 12:40.765
<i>The music, it's not just in me, it is me.</i>

12:42.845 --> 12:45.644
<i>When life gets me down, I play my guitar.</i>

12:46.933 --> 12:51.689
<i>The rest of the world may follow
the rules, but I must follow my heart.</i>

12:53.690 --> 12:56.694
<i>You know that feeling
like there's a song in the air and...</i>

12:56.859 --> 12:58.202
<i>it's playing just for you?</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:05.288
<i>A feeling so close...</i>

13:05.368 --> 13:10.249
<i>you could reach out and touch it</i>

13:10.331 --> 13:15.963
<i>I never knew I could want
something so much, but it's true</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:18.674
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:21.176
<i>Oh, but,</i> Padre, <i>he will never listen.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:23.015
<i>He will listen. To music.</i>

13:23.386 --> 13:29.394
<i>Only a song, only a song
has the power to change a heart</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:36.567
<i>Never underestimate the power of music.</i>

13:41.154 --> 13:44.408
<i>But my father,
he will never give his permission.</i>

13:44.574 --> 13:46.201
<i>I am done asking permission.</i>

13:46.367 --> 13:49.166
<i>When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

13:49.329 --> 13:51.081
<i>You must seize it!</i>

13:51.205 --> 13:55.176
Señor <i>de la Cruz, what did it take</i>
<i>for you to seize your moment?</i>

13:57.086 --> 14:01.717
<i>I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.</i>

14:01.841 --> 14:04.060
<i>It was up to me to reach for that dream.</i>

14:04.218 --> 14:07.597
- <i>Grab it tight and make it come true.
- ...and make it come true.</i>

14:12.352 --> 14:15.731
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

14:17.106 --> 14:20.155
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.537
<i>Día de los Muertos</i> has begun!

14:27.200 --> 14:30.375
No, no. We have to make a clear path.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.962
The petals guide our ancestors home.
We don't want their spirits to get lost.

14:35.124 --> 14:39.129
We want them to come and enjoy
all the food and drinks on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

14:40.630 --> 14:43.133
<i>Mamá!</i> Where should we put this table?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.801
In the courtyard, <i>mijos.</i>

14:44.967 --> 14:48.096
- You want it down by the kitchen?
- <i>Sí.</i> Next to the other one.

14:51.099 --> 14:54.103
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.606
Nothing! <i>Mamá, Papá.</i> I...

14:57.730 --> 15:02.202
Miguel, your <i>abuelita</i> had
the most wonderful idea.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.409
We've all decided.
It's time you joined us in the workshop!

15:06.489 --> 15:07.577
What?

15:07.657 --> 15:08.995
No more shining shoes.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.914
You'll be making them every day after school.

15:11.994 --> 15:17.626
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
the family tradition.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.722
And on <i>Día de los Muertos!</i>
Your ancestors will be so proud.

15:22.839 --> 15:26.429
You'll craft huaraches
just like your <i>Tía</i> Victoria.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.183
And wingtips like your <i>Papá</i> Julio.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.684
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?

15:31.764 --> 15:35.359
Ah, Miguel.
You have your family here to guide you.

15:35.977 --> 15:40.323
You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...

15:41.357 --> 15:44.031
A shoemaker. Through and through.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.031
That's my boy! Berto!

15:47.196 --> 15:49.950
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.387
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

16:14.056 --> 16:17.276
No, no, no, no, no! No.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.411
De la Cruz's guitar?

16:31.574 --> 16:34.749
<i>Papá? Papá?</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:39.878
<i>Mamá</i> Coco, is your <i>papá</i> Ernesto de la Cruz?

16:40.041 --> 16:42.419
<i>Papá! Papá!</i>

16:54.138 --> 16:56.106
<i>Papá! Papá!</i> It's him!

16:56.224 --> 16:58.192
I know who my great-great-grandfather was.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.936
Miguel, get down from there.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.984
<i>Mamá</i> Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!

17:03.064 --> 17:06.785
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna be a musician!

17:08.361 --> 17:12.034
What is all this?
You keep secrets from your own family?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.953
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.912
- Fills his head with crazy fantasies.
- It's not a fantasy.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.918
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!

17:20.998 --> 17:22.795
We've never known anything about this man!

17:22.875 --> 17:26.175
But whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.922
This is no future for my son.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.595
But, <i>Papá,</i> you said my family would guide me.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.097
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.645
I'm supposed to play music.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.892
Never! That man's music was a curse.
I will not allow it.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.648
- If you would just let...
- Miguel...

17:40.810 --> 17:43.529
You will listen to your family.
No more music.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.821
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.992
You want to end up like that man? Forgotten?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.497
Left off your family's <i>ofrenda?</i>

17:53.656 --> 17:56.159
I don't care if I'm on some stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:00.375
- No!
- <i>Mamá!</i>

18:05.501 --> 18:08.721
There. No guitar. No music.

18:11.424 --> 18:16.430
Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat
with your family.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.480
I don't want to be in this family!

18:19.181 --> 18:20.774
Miguel! Miguel!

18:39.535 --> 18:43.506
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz. Can I still sign up?

18:43.664 --> 18:44.711
You got an instrument?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.586
No. But if I can borrow a guitar...

18:47.710 --> 18:49.383
Musicians got to bring their own instruments.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.971
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.140
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, <i>muchacho.</i>

18:58.220 --> 19:00.644
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.899
- I need a guitar just for a little bit.
- Get out of here, kid.

19:18.032 --> 19:22.083
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

20:00.533 --> 20:04.163
No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! <i>Cállate!</i> Sh!

20:25.808 --> 20:27.060
I'm sorry.

21:03.512 --> 21:08.735
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz, please don't be mad.
I'm Miguel.

21:09.018 --> 21:13.524
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.945
Our family thinks music is a curse.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.536
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

21:22.865 --> 21:26.836
You would have told me to follow
my heart. To seize my moment!

21:28.329 --> 21:33.802
So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna
play in the plaza. Just like you did!

21:42.468 --> 21:44.516
The guitar! It's gone!

21:44.845 --> 21:46.722
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!

21:47.223 --> 21:48.725
The window's broken. Look!

21:53.854 --> 21:55.197
All right, who's in there?

21:55.314 --> 21:58.363
I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my...

22:00.611 --> 22:02.238
There's nobody here.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.049
- Miguel!
- <i>Mamá!</i>

22:19.129 --> 22:24.101
Miguel, come home. Where are you, Miguel?

22:27.012 --> 22:31.768
<i>Dios mio!</i> Little boy. Are you okay?
Here. Let me help you.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.021
Thanks. I...

22:45.281 --> 22:46.954
Do you mind? Whoa!

23:07.845 --> 23:10.599
Look how big she's getting.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.269
Dante!

23:15.811 --> 23:21.489
You can see me? Wait! What's going on? Dante!

23:23.444 --> 23:25.162
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:25.321 --> 23:25.908
Miguel?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.911
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

23:31.285 --> 23:34.789
You're here? Here, here. And you can see us?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.419
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

23:37.499 --> 23:39.001
Remind me how I know you.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.003
We're your family, <i>mijo.</i>

23:42.922 --> 23:45.391
- <i>Tía</i> Rosita?
- <i>Sí.</i>

23:47.676 --> 23:49.679
- <i>Papá</i> Julio?
- <i>Hola.</i>

23:50.679 --> 23:52.022
<i>Tía</i> Victoria?

23:52.181 --> 23:54.479
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.361
He's not quite alive either.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.147
We need <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.863
<i>Oye!</i> It's <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.656
She couldn't cross over.

24:05.736 --> 24:08.205
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

24:08.405 --> 24:10.783
<i>Tío</i> Oscar? <i>Tío</i> Felipe?

24:10.866 --> 24:11.993
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.291
I have a feeling
this has something to do with you.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.418
But if <i>Mamá</i> Imelda can't come to us...

24:17.498 --> 24:19.796
Then we are going to her<i>. Vámonos!</i>

24:35.391 --> 24:37.644
Come on, Miguel. It's okay.

24:50.906 --> 24:55.161
Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up!

24:57.579 --> 25:02.255
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

25:22.855 --> 25:26.280
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.115
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.910
I thought it might've been one of those
made up things that adults tell kids.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.704
- Like vitamins.
- Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.377
Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.382
<i>Mija,</i> it's not nice to stare at...
<i>Ay!</i> Santa Maria!

25:49.465 --> 25:53.561
Are those... Alebrijes! But those are...

25:53.719 --> 25:56.392
Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.145
They guide souls on their journey.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.983
Watch your step.
They make <i>caquitas</i> everywhere.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.649
<i>Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.</i>

26:02.811 --> 26:05.485
<i>Please have all offerings ready for re-entry.</i>

26:05.647 --> 26:07.741
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.322
Some churros. From my family.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.328
How wonderful. Next.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.832
<i>If you are experiencing travel issues,
agents at the Department of Family...</i>

26:14.990 --> 26:17.493
<i>Reunions are available to assist you.</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:18.665
Next family, please.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.510
Oh! Your photos are on your son's
<i>ofrenda.</i> Have a great visit.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.419
<i>Gracias.</i>

26:27.544 --> 26:30.673
<i>And remember to return
before sunrise. Enjoy your visit.</i>

26:30.798 --> 26:36.680
Next. Your photo's on your
dentist's <i>ofrenda.</i> Enjoy your visit.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.355
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Next?

26:40.849 --> 26:42.897
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.736
Shall we skip the scanner?

26:44.853 --> 26:48.198
I'm on so many <i>ofrendas</i>
it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.

26:50.109 --> 26:54.455
Well, shoot, looks like
no one put up your photo, Frida.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.834
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now,
that was a lie.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.210
And I apologize for doing that.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.206
No photo on an <i>ofrenda,</i>
no crossing the bridge.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.667
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.340
Hey!

27:15.676 --> 27:19.306
Almost... there. Just a little further.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.523
Upsy-daisy...

27:25.686 --> 27:29.486
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

27:29.648 --> 27:33.573
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.829
- Next?
- Oh! Come, <i>mijo.</i> It's our turn.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.994
Welcome back, <i>amigos.</i> Anything to declare?

27:39.074 --> 27:41.543
As a matter of fact, yes.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.245
<i>Hola.</i>

27:51.044 --> 27:55.720
<i>Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.
Please report to Level Seven.</i>

28:05.350 --> 28:07.023
I miss my nose.

28:16.445 --> 28:20.035
Come on, help us out, <i>amigo.</i> We got
to get to a dozen <i>ofrendas</i> tonight.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.619
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family
for <i>Día de Muertos!</i>

28:23.785 --> 28:26.500
I demand to speak to the person in charge!

28:26.580 --> 28:29.299
I'm sorry, <i>señora,</i>
it says here no one put up your photo.

28:29.458 --> 28:33.804
My family always puts my photo
on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

28:33.962 --> 28:36.932
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

28:37.090 --> 28:41.641
- <i>Mamá</i> Imelda?
- Oh, <i>mi familia!</i>

28:41.803 --> 28:43.305
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

28:43.472 --> 28:48.444
Tell this woman and her devil box
that my photo is on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

28:48.602 --> 28:51.777
Well, we never made it to the <i>ofrenda.</i>

28:51.939 --> 28:53.782
- What?
- We ran into...

28:58.820 --> 29:01.369
- Miguel?
- <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.996
What is going on?

29:04.159 --> 29:05.832
You the Rivera family?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.669
- Well, you're cursed.
- What?

29:10.749 --> 29:14.629
<i>Día de los Muertos</i> is the night to give
to the dead. You stole from the dead!

29:14.753 --> 29:17.092
- But I wasn't stealing the guitar.
- Guitar?

29:17.172 --> 29:20.637
It was my great-great-grandfather's.
He would have wanted me to have it.

29:20.717 --> 29:25.058
We do not speak of that musician.
He is dead to this family.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.141
You're all dead.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.731
I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that?

29:30.811 --> 29:31.938
That's just Dante.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.067
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.694
He just looks like a plain old dog.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.779
Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.614
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.449
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.910
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

29:48.078 --> 29:51.126
But none of this explains why
I couldn't cross over.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.207
Oh!

29:54.209 --> 29:56.837
You took my photo off the <i>ofrenda?</i>

29:56.920 --> 29:59.093
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.762
Well, since it's a family matter...

30:01.842 --> 30:06.058
the way to undo a family curse
is to get your family's blessing.

30:06.138 --> 30:06.764
That's it?

30:06.888 --> 30:10.979
Get your family's blessing and
everything should go back to normal.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.811
But you got to do it by sunrise.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.646
What happens at sunrise?

30:14.771 --> 30:16.739
<i>Híjole!</i> Your hand!

30:22.112 --> 30:24.740
Whoa, Miguel, can't have you fainting on us.

30:25.365 --> 30:29.416
But not to worry. Your family's here.
You can get your blessing right now.

30:29.578 --> 30:34.505
<i>Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.</i>
Aha! <i>Perdón, señora.</i>

30:35.959 --> 30:38.257
Now, you look at the living and say his name.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.217
Miguel.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.637
Nailed it. Now say, "I give you my blessing."

30:43.717 --> 30:45.936
I give you my blessing.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.066
I give you my blessing to go home...

30:51.558 --> 30:56.525
to put my photo back on the <i>ofrenda,</i>
and to never play music again.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.819
What? She can't do that!

30:58.899 --> 31:01.744
Well, technically,
she can add any condition she wants.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.703
- Fine.
- Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.011
No skeletons!

31:24.633 --> 31:26.761
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.186
Two seconds
and you already break your promise.

31:33.266 --> 31:36.315
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.107
<i>Papá</i> Julio, I ask for your blessing.

31:39.773 --> 31:42.151
<i>Tía</i> Rosita? Oscar?

31:42.442 --> 31:45.036
Felipe? <i>Tía</i> Victoria?

31:45.153 --> 31:49.119
Don't make this hard, <i>mijo.</i>
You go home my way or no way.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.246
You really hate music that much?

31:51.326 --> 31:53.954
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.089
The same path he did. He's family.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.048
- Listen to your <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.
- She's just looking out for you.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.132
Be reasonable.

32:05.215 --> 32:10.187
<i>Con permiso,</i> I need to visit
the restroom. Be right back.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.475
Should we tell him there are no
restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

32:27.904 --> 32:28.950
<i>Vámonos.</i>

32:29.030 --> 32:31.495
We got a family looking for a living boy.

32:31.575 --> 32:34.078
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.121
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.547
Hold it, <i>muchacho.</i>

32:41.751 --> 32:45.506
I found that living boy! Oh, whoa,
excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.677
Excuse me.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.481
No, no. Dante!

32:55.182 --> 32:59.904
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer. Falsifying a unibrow.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.234
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.400
You need to clean up your act, <i>amigo.</i>

33:04.566 --> 33:09.789
<i>Amigo?</i> Oh, that's so nice to hear you
say that because I have just had a...

33:09.946 --> 33:14.076
really hard <i>Día de Muertos</i> and
I could really use an <i>amigo</i> right now.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.666
And <i>amigos,</i> they help their <i>amigos.</i>

33:16.786 --> 33:20.757
You get me across that bridge tonight,
and I'll make it worth your while.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.628
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

33:23.752 --> 33:27.427
I can get you front row seats
to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.470
I'll get you backstage. You can meet him.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.218
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

33:31.384 --> 33:33.432
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.644
But my shift's almost up
and I want to visit my living family.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.943
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

33:41.311 --> 33:45.066
- Can I at least get my costume back?
- No.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.110
Some <i>amigo.</i>

33:50.153 --> 33:53.623
Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz?

33:53.782 --> 33:56.126
Who wants to... <i>Ay!</i> You're alive!

33:56.326 --> 33:59.876
Sh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to
get back to the Land of the Living...

33:59.996 --> 34:01.418
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.924
That's weirdly specific.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.835
He's my great-great-grandfather.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.966
He's your Gr... What?

34:09.673 --> 34:12.176
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.305
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

34:16.471 --> 34:20.476
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

34:20.600 --> 34:22.477
You know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good...

34:22.644 --> 34:24.988
No, no, <i>niño! Niño, niño,</i> I can help you.
You can help me.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.069
We can help each other.
But most importantly, you can help me.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.776
- Miguel!
- I'm Héctor.

34:29.901 --> 34:30.777
That's nice.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.371
<i>Espérame, chamaco!</i>

34:45.542 --> 34:50.799
<i>Ay,</i> he is going to get himself killed.
I need my spirit guide... Pepita.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.316
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

35:05.478 --> 35:08.232
Here. Nice alebrije.

35:21.202 --> 35:25.753
<i>Ay, ay,</i> hold still. Look up<i>. A ver, a ver.</i>
Look up, up, up.

35:27.375 --> 35:32.177
<i>Aqui arriba, eso...</i> Eh, <i>la rayita.</i>

35:32.339 --> 35:34.717
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

35:35.717 --> 35:37.094
Dead as a doorknob.

35:38.428 --> 35:41.398
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.560
When you're well remembered, people
put up your photo and you get to...

35:44.726 --> 35:48.606
cross the bridge and visit the living
on <i>Día de Muertos.</i> Unless you're me.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.365
You don't get to cross over?

35:50.523 --> 35:53.242
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!

35:54.277 --> 35:55.490
This is you?

35:55.570 --> 35:56.947
Eh, <i>muy guapo,</i> eh?

35:57.113 --> 36:00.083
So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa...

36:00.241 --> 36:02.960
then I put up your photo when I get home?

36:03.119 --> 36:06.794
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup.

36:06.956 --> 36:10.460
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.426
Like, tonight. So, you got
any other family here, you know?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.682
Someone a bit more accessible?

36:15.799 --> 36:17.551
Mm... Nope.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.390
Don't yank my chain, <i>chamaco.</i>
You got to have some other family.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.895
Only de la Cruz. If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

36:25.225 --> 36:29.230
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine!
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

36:31.231 --> 36:35.828
It's not gonna be easy, you know?
He's a busy man. What are you doing?

36:35.985 --> 36:38.454
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.160
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.793
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

36:44.452 --> 36:49.458
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular? <i>Qué padre!</i>

36:50.083 --> 36:53.132
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

36:53.294 --> 36:54.637
to mark the end of <i>Día de Muertos.</i>

36:54.921 --> 36:56.389
And you can get us in!

36:57.632 --> 36:59.554
Hey, you said you have front row tickets!

36:59.634 --> 37:02.433
That... was a lie. I apologize for that.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.099
Cool off, <i>chamaco.</i>
Come on. I'll get you to him.

37:05.265 --> 37:05.982
How?

37:06.141 --> 37:07.984
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

37:18.862 --> 37:22.742
<i>Remember me
Don't let it make you cry</i>

37:24.117 --> 37:26.290
You better have my dress, Héctor.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.545
<i>Hola,</i> Ceci.

37:33.710 --> 37:38.216
- <i>Hola.</i>
- Ceci, I lost the dress.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.386
<i>Ya lo sabía!</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:41.851
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.355
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

37:45.889 --> 37:49.610
Dante! We shouldn't be in here.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.872
No, no, Dante! <i>Ven acá!</i>

38:15.710 --> 38:17.757
You! How did you get in here?

38:17.837 --> 38:22.013
- I just followed my...
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

38:22.133 --> 38:27.936
Guider of wandering spirits. And
whose spirit have you guided to me?

38:28.056 --> 38:30.400
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

38:31.518 --> 38:34.315
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.365
They are as mysterious as they are powerful.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.742
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.963
You are the audience. Darkness.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.460
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

38:57.794 --> 39:03.927
Dancers emerge from the papaya,
and the dancers are all me.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.598
And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother, who is a cactus.

39:08.805 --> 39:14.483
But who is also me.
And her milk is not milk but tears.

39:15.812 --> 39:16.904
Is it too obvious?

39:17.021 --> 39:20.446
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

39:20.608 --> 39:23.828
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

39:27.448 --> 39:28.791
Oh! And then it could go...

39:34.497 --> 39:36.465
And what if everything was on fire?

39:37.292 --> 39:39.340
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

39:39.586 --> 39:43.762
Inspired! You have the spirit of an artist.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.429
The dancers exit.
The music fades, the lights go out.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.815
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!

39:55.894 --> 39:56.941
Huh?

39:57.061 --> 39:59.189
He does a couple of songs,
the sun rises, everyone cheers...

39:59.314 --> 40:01.817
Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?

40:01.983 --> 40:03.986
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

40:04.152 --> 40:07.622
He's too busy hosting that fancy party
at the top of his tower.

40:11.492 --> 40:15.338
<i>Chamaco,</i> you can't run off on me
like that. Stop pestering the celebrities.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.378
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

40:17.540 --> 40:20.214
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.799
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

40:22.879 --> 40:25.633
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

40:25.798 --> 40:28.517
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

40:28.676 --> 40:31.680
Hey, Gustavo!
You know anything about this party?

40:31.804 --> 40:33.101
It's the hot ticket!

40:33.181 --> 40:37.061
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never getting in, <i>Chorizo.</i>

40:37.226 --> 40:39.479
Hey! It's <i>Chorizo! Choricito!</i>

40:39.604 --> 40:42.949
- A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny.
- <i>Chorizo?</i>

40:43.066 --> 40:47.071
Oh, this guy's famous!
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.538
I don't want to talk about it.

40:48.696 --> 40:51.450
He choked on some <i>chorizo!</i>

40:54.035 --> 40:57.539
I didn't choke, okay? I got food
poisoning which is a big difference.

40:58.873 --> 41:02.048
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.796
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

41:04.921 --> 41:08.801
If you really want to get to Ernesto,
there is that music competition...

41:08.883 --> 41:12.763
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.025
No, no<i>. Chamaco,</i> you're <i>loco</i> if you think...

41:17.183 --> 41:19.186
I need to get
my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

41:19.352 --> 41:21.070
You know where I can get a guitar?

41:23.064 --> 41:24.907
I know a guy.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.714
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

41:40.748 --> 41:43.422
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.671
- Size seven!
- And a half.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.426
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.479
Why the heck would you want to be a musician?

41:59.559 --> 42:01.687
My great-great-grandpa was a musician!

42:01.811 --> 42:05.532
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.236
No thank you. No! <i>Guácala!</i>

42:07.316 --> 42:11.287
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

42:11.446 --> 42:12.322
We're almost there.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.003
Keep up, <i>chamaco.</i> Come on.

42:27.962 --> 42:32.468
- Cousin Héctor!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, <i>Tío!</i>

42:32.633 --> 42:35.307
- <i>¿Qué onda?</i>
- These people are all your family?

42:36.512 --> 42:39.812
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or <i>ofrendas.</i>

42:39.974 --> 42:42.602
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

42:43.144 --> 42:47.399
So, we all call each other cousin,
or <i>tío,</i> or whatever.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.871
- Héctor!
- <i>Tía</i> Chelo!

42:55.740 --> 42:57.663
<i>Muchas gracias!</i>

42:58.117 --> 43:00.336
Hey! Save some for me! Is Chicharrón around?

43:00.536 --> 43:04.291
Eh, in the bungalow. I don't know
if he's in the mood for visitors.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.385
Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?

43:16.677 --> 43:18.350
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Chicharrón!

43:18.513 --> 43:20.982
I don't want to see your stupid face, Héctor.

43:21.099 --> 43:24.524
Come on. It's <i>Día de Muertos.</i>
I brought you a little offering.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.237
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.278
But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel...

43:30.441 --> 43:32.239
We really need to borrow your guitar.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.987
- My guitar?
- Yes.

43:34.112 --> 43:37.867
- My prized beloved guitar?
- I promise we'll bring it right back.

43:38.032 --> 43:41.912
Like the time you promised to bring
back my van? Or my mini-fridge?

43:42.036 --> 43:43.788
- Ah, you see...
- Or my good napkins?

43:43.871 --> 43:45.498
My lasso? My femur?

43:45.665 --> 43:48.168
- Well, no, not like those times.
- Where is my femur? You...

43:51.295 --> 43:54.799
- You okay, <i>amigo?</i>
- I'm fading, Héctor.

43:55.716 --> 44:01.268
I can feel it. I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.732
You play me something.

44:06.894 --> 44:10.569
No. You know I don't play anymore,
Cheech. The guitar is for the kid.

44:11.190 --> 44:14.569
You want it, you got to earn it.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.907
<i>Ay,</i> only for you, <i>amigo.</i>

44:21.742 --> 44:23.085
Any requests?

44:24.412 --> 44:26.915
You know my favorite, Héctor.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.894
<i>Well, everyone knows Juanita</i>

44:49.770 --> 44:52.774
<i>Her eyes each a different color</i>

44:54.609 --> 44:59.081
<i>Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in</i>

45:00.406 --> 45:02.625
<i>And her...</i>

45:03.743 --> 45:06.792
<i>Knuckles they drag on the floor</i>

45:07.121 --> 45:09.465
- Those aren't the words.
- There are children present.

45:09.624 --> 45:13.174
<i>Her hair is like a briar</i>

45:14.503 --> 45:18.133
<i>She stands in a bow-legged stance</i>

45:20.134 --> 45:24.139
<i>And if I weren't so ugly</i>

45:26.140 --> 45:31.363
<i>She'd possibly give me a chance</i>

45:37.360 --> 45:39.658
Brings back memories.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.827
<i>Gracias.</i>

46:17.066 --> 46:18.818
Wait. What happened?

46:19.485 --> 46:20.862
He's been forgotten.

46:21.529 --> 46:24.248
When there's no one left in
the living world who remembers you...

46:24.407 --> 46:29.379
you disappear from this world.
We call it the final death.

46:30.079 --> 46:32.173
Where did he go?

46:32.331 --> 46:33.674
No one knows.

46:33.833 --> 46:37.508
But I've met him.
I could remember him when I go back!

46:37.670 --> 46:39.263
No, it doesn't work like that, <i>chamaco.</i>

46:40.089 --> 46:44.720
Our memories, they have to be passed
down by those who knew us in life...

46:44.885 --> 46:47.388
in the stories they tell about us.

46:48.431 --> 46:51.105
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.942
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

46:56.105 --> 46:58.733
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.874
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.918
How do you think
I knew your great-great-grandpa?

47:17.084 --> 47:19.678
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.

47:20.338 --> 47:23.513
<i>No manches!</i>
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz...

47:23.674 --> 47:25.392
the greatest musician of all time?

47:25.551 --> 47:29.101
Ah, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.936
But his music? Eh, not so much.

47:31.057 --> 47:32.900
You don't know what you're talking about.

47:35.436 --> 47:40.283
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
Showtime, <i>chamaco!</i>

47:46.614 --> 47:49.208
<i>Llévelo!</i> T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

47:55.998 --> 47:59.343
<i>Bienvenidos a todos!</i>

48:01.921 --> 48:05.300
Who's ready for some <i>música?</i>

48:06.384 --> 48:08.762
It's a battle of the bands, <i>amigos.</i>

48:09.136 --> 48:14.142
The winner gets to play for the maestro
himself, Ernesto de la Cruz...

48:14.308 --> 48:16.652
at his <i>fiesta</i> tonight!

48:17.061 --> 48:18.608
That's our ticket, <i>muchacho.</i>

48:20.606 --> 48:23.451
Let the competition begin!

48:40.167 --> 48:42.090
So, what's the plan? What are you gonna play?

48:42.253 --> 48:43.596
Definitely <i>Remember Me.</i>

48:43.754 --> 48:46.929
- No! Not that one. No.
- Come on. It's his most popular song!

48:47.091 --> 48:48.343
It's too popular.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.432
<i>Remember me Though I have to travel far</i>

48:50.594 --> 48:53.689
- <i>Remember me...
- Don't let it make you cry...</i>

48:58.352 --> 49:01.697
- What about <i>Poco Loco?</i>
- <i>Epa!</i> Now that's a song!

49:01.856 --> 49:05.360
De la Cruzcito? You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.700
Los Chachalacos!

49:19.957 --> 49:21.800
You always this nervous before a performance?

49:21.959 --> 49:24.963
I don't know. I've never performed before.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.093
What? You said you were a musician!

49:27.173 --> 49:28.766
I am! I mean, I will be.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.226
- <i>Ay!</i>
- Once I win.

49:30.551 --> 49:34.556
That's your plan? No. You have to win.
Your life literally depends on...

49:34.722 --> 49:37.225
you winning. And you've never
done this before! I'll go up there.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.644
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

49:39.810 --> 49:43.861
If I can't go out and play one song,
how can I call myself a musician?

49:44.023 --> 49:44.990
What does that matter?

49:45.107 --> 49:47.201
Because I don't just want to get
de la Cruz's blessing...

49:47.401 --> 49:51.247
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.

49:51.989 --> 49:56.620
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment
at such a bad time!

49:59.580 --> 50:03.210
Okay! Okay. You want to perform?
Then you got to perform!

50:03.334 --> 50:06.429
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

50:10.925 --> 50:12.388
Now give me your best <i>grito.</i>

50:12.468 --> 50:15.017
- My best <i>grito?</i>
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.

50:18.224 --> 50:21.319
Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.447
Oh, come on, kid.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.038
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

50:41.121 --> 50:44.876
Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me.
You can do this.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.802
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.472
Make them listen, <i>chamaco.</i> You've got this.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.758
De la Cruzcito!

51:00.641 --> 51:02.644
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

51:03.394 --> 51:05.647
Bring back the singing dogs!

51:17.408 --> 51:20.207
<i>Qué bien! Vámonos!</i> Whoo!

51:28.294 --> 51:31.798
<i>What color is the sky? Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:31.964 --> 51:35.594
<i>You tell me that it's red
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:35.759 --> 51:39.138
<i>Where should I put my shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:39.263 --> 51:44.110
<i>You say put them on your head
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:44.226 --> 51:48.698
<i>You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco</i>

51:49.023 --> 51:52.072
<i>The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing</i>

51:52.651 --> 51:55.120
<i>I'll count it as a blessing</i>

51:55.237 --> 51:59.162
<i>That I'm only un poco loco</i>

52:00.701 --> 52:02.203
No! No! No!

52:08.876 --> 52:12.881
- Not bad for a dead guy!
- Not so bad yourself, <i>gordito! Eso!</i>

52:20.220 --> 52:21.767
He's close! Find him!

52:21.889 --> 52:25.564
<i>The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy</i>

52:25.851 --> 52:27.524
<i>The sense that you're not making</i>

52:27.686 --> 52:29.563
<i>The liberties you're taking</i>

52:29.688 --> 52:35.661
<i>Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco</i>

52:45.162 --> 52:47.790
- We're looking for a living kid.
- About twelve?

52:47.915 --> 52:49.667
Have you seen a living boy?

52:50.584 --> 52:55.932
<i>Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to loco</i>

53:04.056 --> 53:08.903
Hey! You did good! I'm proud of you<i>. Eso!</i>

53:09.895 --> 53:12.944
<i>Otra! Otra! Otra!</i>

53:18.404 --> 53:20.618
- Hey! Where are you going?
- We got to get out of here!

53:20.698 --> 53:22.917
What? Are you crazy?
We're about to win this thing.

53:24.284 --> 53:27.788
<i>Damas y caballeros,</i>
I have an emergency announcement.

53:27.955 --> 53:33.303
Please be on the lookout for a living
boy. Answers to the name of Miguel.

53:33.460 --> 53:36.964
Earlier tonight he ran away from his family.

53:37.089 --> 53:39.808
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.054
Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.972
The only person who could send you home.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.391
I do have other family, but...

53:46.557 --> 53:48.230
You could have taken my photo back
this whole time?

53:48.350 --> 53:51.229
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

53:51.311 --> 53:53.314
- You lied to me!
- You're one to talk.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.736
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.614
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

53:57.776 --> 54:00.325
I'm not gonna miss my one chance
to cross that bridge because...

54:00.487 --> 54:03.241
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.580
- It's not stupid!
- I'm taking you to your family.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.165
- Let go of me!
- You'll thank me later.

54:07.327 --> 54:09.751
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

54:10.414 --> 54:13.338
Keep your dumb photo. Stay away from me!

54:13.500 --> 54:14.501
No!

54:16.170 --> 54:18.969
Hey, <i>chamaco!</i> Where did you go?

54:20.340 --> 54:23.719
<i>Chamaco!</i> I'm sorry! Come back!

54:33.687 --> 54:38.113
Dante, <i>cállate!</i> No! Dante, stop it.

54:38.275 --> 54:43.031
He can't help me. Dante! Stop!

54:43.155 --> 54:45.078
Stop it! Leave me alone!

54:45.532 --> 54:49.662
You're not a spirit guide. You're just
a dumb dog! Now get out of here!

54:49.953 --> 54:52.547
- It's him!
- It's that living boy!

54:52.706 --> 54:54.208
- I heard about him. Look!
- He's alive!

54:54.333 --> 54:55.710
- He's alive.
- The boy is alive!

55:06.220 --> 55:08.644
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

55:08.806 --> 55:11.480
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.064
I don't want your blessing!

55:14.394 --> 55:16.237
Miguel, stop!

55:18.232 --> 55:22.203
Come back! Miguel!

55:27.074 --> 55:28.826
I am trying to save your life!

55:28.951 --> 55:30.919
- You're ruining my life!
- What?

55:31.203 --> 55:35.584
Music's the only thing that makes me
happy. And you want to take it away.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.918
You'll never understand.

55:41.171 --> 55:45.847
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

55:46.009 --> 55:49.764
<i>No dejaré de quererte...</i>

55:51.265 --> 55:52.938
I thought you hated music.

55:53.058 --> 55:58.064
I loved it! I remember that feeling...

55:58.772 --> 56:04.780
when my husband would play, and
I would sing and nothing else mattered.

56:06.196 --> 56:10.952
But when we had Coco, suddenly
there was something in my life that...

56:11.118 --> 56:16.215
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

56:17.249 --> 56:19.923
He wanted to play for the world.

56:21.253 --> 56:24.473
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.884
Now you must make a choice.

56:27.050 --> 56:29.804
But I don't want to pick sides!

56:29.970 --> 56:34.316
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's supposed to do.

56:34.474 --> 56:39.105
Support you. But you never will.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.089
- Have a good time.
- Oh, how exciting!

57:02.753 --> 57:07.350
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan! You mind if I...

57:12.512 --> 57:14.355
<i>Gracias, Señor.</i>

57:17.851 --> 57:19.649
- Invitation?
- It's okay.

57:19.811 --> 57:21.688
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

57:33.283 --> 57:36.537
- <i>Disculpen, señores...</i>
- Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

57:36.703 --> 57:39.047
- You were on fire tonight!
- You too!

57:39.206 --> 57:42.710
Hey, musician to musician... I need a favor.

57:45.379 --> 57:49.054
The competition winners.
Congratulations, <i>chicos.</i>

57:59.851 --> 58:00.898
Thanks, guys!

58:13.490 --> 58:16.539
- Hey! Enjoy the party, little <i>músico!</i>
- <i>Gracias!</i>

58:21.081 --> 58:21.798
Oh!

58:31.883 --> 58:33.601
Look! It's Ernesto!

58:35.345 --> 58:36.312
De la Cruz!

58:37.764 --> 58:39.232
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz!

58:41.476 --> 58:45.401
Pardon me! <i>Señor</i> de la Cruz! <i>Señor</i> de la...

58:50.944 --> 58:53.948
<i>When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

58:54.114 --> 58:55.787
<i>You must seize it.</i>

58:55.949 --> 58:57.952
<i>This one has a wise spirit.</i>

59:12.758 --> 59:14.476
<i>We're almost there, Dante.</i>

59:18.472 --> 59:21.100
<i>Señor</i> de la Cruz! <i>Señor</i> de la...

59:26.980 --> 59:29.403
<i>But what can we do? It is hopeless...</i>

59:29.483 --> 59:33.158
- <i>You must have faith, sister.</i>
- <i>But</i> Padre, <i>he will never listen.</i>

59:33.320 --> 59:35.869
<i>He will listen... to music.</i>

1:00:00.472 --> 1:00:04.978
<i>Señoras y señores, buenas tardes,
buenas noches</i>

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:08.902
<i>Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Señoritas y señores</i>

1:00:09.022 --> 1:00:13.368
<i>To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy! Qué alegría</i>

1:00:13.652 --> 1:00:18.158
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

1:00:19.533 --> 1:00:24.209
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

1:00:25.539 --> 1:00:30.966
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:32.755
<i>For this music is my lang...</i>

1:00:45.225 --> 1:00:46.727
Are you all right, <i>niño?</i>

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:55.903
It's you! You are that boy! The one
who came from the Land of the Living.

1:00:56.069 --> 1:00:58.037
You... know about me?

1:00:58.155 --> 1:01:02.911
You are all anyone has been talking
about. Why have you come here?

1:01:03.702 --> 1:01:07.878
I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson.

1:01:09.249 --> 1:01:11.752
I... have a great-great-grandson?

1:01:11.877 --> 1:01:15.675
I need your blessing so I can go
back home and be a musician.

1:01:15.755 --> 1:01:20.682
Just like you. The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:24.018
But I hoped you would.

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:30.567
My boy, with a talent like yours,
how could I not listen?

1:01:33.732 --> 1:01:36.030
I have a great-great-grandson!

1:01:42.782 --> 1:01:46.036
- Look! It's Frida!
- Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

1:01:46.411 --> 1:01:49.256
- It is an honor, <i>Señora.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:57.135
Hey, Negrete! Infante! Have you
met my great-great-grandson?

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:59.387
My great-great-grandson.

1:01:59.507 --> 1:02:01.805
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

1:02:01.927 --> 1:02:03.804
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

1:02:03.929 --> 1:02:04.976
No dimple!

1:02:05.096 --> 1:02:06.393
<i>To our friendship.</i>

1:02:06.514 --> 1:02:10.485
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

1:02:11.895 --> 1:02:13.317
Poison!

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:15.608
You know, I did all my own stunts.

1:02:15.732 --> 1:02:19.407
<i>Though I have to say goodbye Remember me...</i>

1:02:21.488 --> 1:02:24.788
All of this came from my amazing fans
in the Land of the Living.

1:02:26.576 --> 1:02:29.955
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

1:02:30.664 --> 1:02:33.964
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

1:02:34.125 --> 1:02:37.345
- No! It's all great!
- But?

1:02:37.462 --> 1:02:41.592
It's just... I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

1:02:42.384 --> 1:02:45.479
You're the guy who actually did it!

1:02:46.263 --> 1:02:51.941
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music over everything else?

1:02:52.978 --> 1:02:58.235
It was hard. Saying goodbye to
my hometown. Heading off on my own...

1:02:59.651 --> 1:03:00.698
Leaving your family?

1:03:01.695 --> 1:03:05.871
<i>Sí.</i> But I could not have done it differently.

1:03:06.533 --> 1:03:09.378
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.

1:03:10.036 --> 1:03:14.166
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

1:03:16.710 --> 1:03:21.216
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:23.717
The world is our family.

1:03:25.343 --> 1:03:27.971
The fireworks have begun!

1:03:38.565 --> 1:03:42.069
Soon the party will move across town
for my Sunrise Spectacular.

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:47.742
Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!

1:03:47.907 --> 1:03:50.001
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

1:03:52.662 --> 1:03:56.667
I can't. I have to get home before sunrise.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:58.836
Oh! I really do need to get you home.

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:07.762
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1:04:08.553 --> 1:04:09.930
I hope you die very soon.

1:04:12.724 --> 1:04:14.146
You know what I mean.

1:04:16.686 --> 1:04:20.907
- Miguel, I give you my bless...
- We had a deal, <i>chamaco.</i>

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:24.278
Who are you? What is the meaning of this?

1:04:25.445 --> 1:04:27.448
Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.

1:04:28.448 --> 1:04:31.293
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:33.286
You know this man?

1:04:33.453 --> 1:04:36.673
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

1:04:37.582 --> 1:04:39.209
Héctor?

1:04:39.793 --> 1:04:42.717
Please, Miguel. Put my photo up.

1:04:44.422 --> 1:04:48.263
My friend, you're being forgotten.

1:04:48.343 --> 1:04:50.640
- And whose fault is that?
- Héctor, please...

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:53.519
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:54.391
What?

1:04:54.474 --> 1:04:57.649
If I'm being forgotten, it's because
you never told anyone that I wrote them!

1:04:57.769 --> 1:05:00.864
That's crazy!
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

1:05:01.231 --> 1:05:03.108
You want to tell him or should I?

1:05:03.233 --> 1:05:08.990
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but you died...

1:05:09.072 --> 1:05:13.999
and I only sang your songs because
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.628
How generous!

1:05:15.787 --> 1:05:17.915
You really did play together.

1:05:18.081 --> 1:05:22.132
I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.

1:05:22.293 --> 1:05:25.968
Miguel can put my photo up,
and I can cross over the bridge.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:31.558
I can see my girl.
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

1:05:31.678 --> 1:05:33.055
That was a long time ago.

1:05:33.179 --> 1:05:36.524
We drank together and you told me
you would move Heaven and Earth...

1:05:36.683 --> 1:05:40.483
for your <i>amigo.</i> Well, I'm asking you to now.

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:43.156
Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie?

1:05:43.273 --> 1:05:45.742
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1:05:46.151 --> 1:05:48.154
In the de la Cruz movie, <i>El Camino a Casa.</i>

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:52.124
- I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
- No! It's in there. Look!

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:56.871
<i>Never were truer words spoken.
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!</i>

1:05:57.537 --> 1:05:59.631
<i>I would move Heaven</i>
<i>and Earth for you,</i> mi amigo.

1:05:59.747 --> 1:06:02.796
But in the movie,
Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1:06:03.293 --> 1:06:05.887
- <i>Salud!</i>
- Poison!

1:06:08.214 --> 1:06:11.559
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:14.478
<i>We'd been performing on the road
for months. I got homesick...</i>

1:06:16.681 --> 1:06:18.228
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:22.437
You want to give up now when
we're this close to reaching our dream?

1:06:22.562 --> 1:06:24.405
This was your dream. You'll manage.

1:06:24.522 --> 1:06:26.240
I can't do this without your songs, Héctor.

1:06:26.357 --> 1:06:30.032
I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me
if you want, but my mind is made up.

1:06:33.907 --> 1:06:39.505
I could never hate you. If you must go,
then I'm sending you off with a toast.

1:06:43.291 --> 1:06:44.588
To our friendship.

1:06:44.751 --> 1:06:48.927
I would move Heaven and Earth for you,
<i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:57.765
<i>You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.</i>

1:06:58.681 --> 1:07:00.274
<i>I thought it must have been something I ate.</i>

1:07:00.433 --> 1:07:02.276
Perhaps it was that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

1:07:02.936 --> 1:07:05.155
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1:07:08.775 --> 1:07:10.527
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

1:07:12.445 --> 1:07:14.618
You poisoned me.

1:07:14.781 --> 1:07:18.035
You're confusing movies with reality, Héctor.

1:07:18.201 --> 1:07:21.455
All this time,
I thought it was just bad luck.

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:24.795
<i>I never thought that you might have...
That you...</i>

1:07:30.755 --> 1:07:32.348
- How could you?
- Héctor!

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:33.432
Security! Security!

1:07:34.801 --> 1:07:38.431
You took everything away from me! You rat!

1:07:39.889 --> 1:07:42.358
Have him taken care of. He's not well.

1:07:42.892 --> 1:07:46.692
I just wanted to go back home. No! No!

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:52.285
I apologize. Where were we?

1:07:52.652 --> 1:07:54.780
You were going to give me your blessing.

1:07:54.946 --> 1:07:57.119
Yes<i>. Sí.</i>

1:08:00.034 --> 1:08:03.163
Miguel, my reputation...

1:08:03.496 --> 1:08:09.469
It is very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:13.011
That you murdered Héctor for his songs?

1:08:15.174 --> 1:08:18.053
You don't think that. Do you?

1:08:18.177 --> 1:08:22.774
I... No. Everyone knows you're the good guy.

1:08:29.689 --> 1:08:32.192
<i>Papá</i> Ernesto, my blessing?

1:08:34.861 --> 1:08:39.333
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:41.793
What? But I'm your family!

1:08:41.909 --> 1:08:44.037
And Héctor was my best friend.

1:08:45.204 --> 1:08:48.208
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:53.135
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes to seize your moment.

1:08:54.339 --> 1:08:55.886
I know you understand.

1:08:56.049 --> 1:08:58.052
No! No!

1:09:00.219 --> 1:09:03.098
Let go! No!

1:09:25.703 --> 1:09:32.086
Help! Can anyone hear me? I want to go home.

1:09:50.937 --> 1:09:52.439
- Héctor?
- Kid?

1:09:52.605 --> 1:09:58.283
Héctor! You were right.
I should have gone back to my family.

1:09:58.444 --> 1:10:02.699
They told me not to be like de la Cruz,
but I didn't listen.

1:10:02.782 --> 1:10:05.627
I told them
I didn't care if they remembered me.

1:10:05.785 --> 1:10:08.789
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

1:10:08.913 --> 1:10:11.667
Hey, <i>chamaco.</i> It's okay. It's okay.

1:10:11.791 --> 1:10:14.260
I told them I didn't care.

1:10:18.297 --> 1:10:21.142
Héctor! Héctor?

1:10:22.176 --> 1:10:24.804
She's forgetting me.

1:10:25.722 --> 1:10:28.646
- Who?
- My daughter.

1:10:31.102 --> 1:10:35.027
She's the reason
you wanted to cross the bridge.

1:10:35.898 --> 1:10:41.325
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

1:10:42.947 --> 1:10:44.790
I wish I could apologize.

1:10:45.158 --> 1:10:48.162
I wish I could tell her that
her <i>papá</i> was trying to come home.

1:10:49.162 --> 1:10:51.290
That he loved her so much.

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:55.088
My Coco...

1:10:57.837 --> 1:10:59.259
Coco?

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:17.820
Where did you get this?

1:11:18.566 --> 1:11:22.491
That's my <i>Mamá</i> Coco. That's my <i>Mamá</i> Imelda.

1:11:23.529 --> 1:11:26.328
Is that you?

1:11:30.203 --> 1:11:33.503
We're... family?

1:11:46.052 --> 1:11:50.558
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.

1:11:51.224 --> 1:11:54.899
Maybe put up my photo. But it never happened.

1:11:56.229 --> 1:11:57.526
You know the worst part?

1:11:58.064 --> 1:12:00.738
Even if I never got to see Coco
in the living world...

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:05.827
I thought at least one day I'd see
her here. Give her the biggest hug.

1:12:08.157 --> 1:12:10.626
But she's the last person who remembers me.

1:12:11.619 --> 1:12:13.792
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1:12:14.247 --> 1:12:19.845
You disappear... from this one.
You'll never get to see her.

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:21.595
Ever again.

1:12:24.882 --> 1:12:27.385
You know, I wrote her a song once.

1:12:28.094 --> 1:12:31.519
We used to sing it every night
at the same time.

1:12:32.181 --> 1:12:34.434
No matter how far apart we were.

1:12:35.768 --> 1:12:41.116
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her
one... last... time.

1:12:43.109 --> 1:12:46.284
<i>Remember me</i>

1:12:46.779 --> 1:12:51.125
<i>Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me</i>

1:12:52.952 --> 1:12:55.875
<i>Don't let it make you cry</i>

1:12:55.955 --> 1:13:01.132
<i>For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart</i>

1:13:01.252 --> 1:13:06.554
<i>I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart</i>

1:13:07.967 --> 1:13:10.470
<i>Remember me</i>

1:13:11.053 --> 1:13:12.100
<i>Papá!</i>

1:13:12.221 --> 1:13:16.317
<i>Though I have to travel far
Remember me</i>

1:13:17.602 --> 1:13:20.822
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:27.237
<i>Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be</i>

1:13:29.572 --> 1:13:33.793
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

1:13:35.995 --> 1:13:42.344
<i>Remember me</i>

1:13:48.466 --> 1:13:51.686
He stole your guitar. He stole your songs.

1:13:52.511 --> 1:13:56.015
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

1:13:56.182 --> 1:14:00.358
I didn't write <i>Remember Me</i>
for the world. I wrote it for Coco.

1:14:02.563 --> 1:14:04.691
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

1:14:04.857 --> 1:14:08.737
Are you kidding? A minute ago
I thought I was related to a murderer.

1:14:08.861 --> 1:14:13.663
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life, there's been something...

1:14:13.824 --> 1:14:17.374
that made me different.
And I never knew where it came from.

1:14:18.079 --> 1:14:20.707
But now I know. It comes from you.

1:14:21.832 --> 1:14:27.009
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

1:14:34.053 --> 1:14:37.102
I'm proud to be his family!

1:14:51.737 --> 1:14:53.080
Dante?

1:14:55.241 --> 1:14:56.459
Dante!

1:14:58.744 --> 1:15:00.371
It's Dante!

1:15:11.507 --> 1:15:14.431
- Imelda!
- Héctor.

1:15:15.302 --> 1:15:16.645
You look good.

1:15:28.107 --> 1:15:31.282
Dante! You knew he was my
<i>Papá</i> Héctor the whole time!

1:15:31.444 --> 1:15:33.367
You are a real spirit guide.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:35.953
Who's the good spirit guide? You are!

1:15:56.052 --> 1:15:57.349
Dante!

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:21.999
There they are!

1:16:22.161 --> 1:16:26.792
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:30.799
<i>Gracias, Dios mío. Qué bueno.</i>

1:16:45.267 --> 1:16:49.238
<i>Mijo,</i> I was so worried!
Thank goodness we found you in time.

1:16:50.523 --> 1:16:54.027
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

1:16:54.193 --> 1:16:54.910
Imelda.

1:16:55.027 --> 1:16:58.372
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

1:16:58.531 --> 1:17:02.001
I spent decades protecting my family
from your mistakes.

1:17:02.118 --> 1:17:05.543
He spends five minutes with you
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1:17:05.704 --> 1:17:07.331
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.

1:17:07.456 --> 1:17:11.882
He was in there because of me.
He was just trying to get me home!

1:17:12.545 --> 1:17:16.049
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.

1:17:16.674 --> 1:17:18.551
Nothing's more important than family.

1:17:20.219 --> 1:17:22.893
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1:17:23.055 --> 1:17:27.060
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1:17:27.643 --> 1:17:29.395
To get Héctor's photo.

1:17:29.562 --> 1:17:30.900
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:34.359
Héctor should be on our <i>ofrenda.</i>
He's part of our family.

1:17:34.441 --> 1:17:35.613
He left this family!

1:17:35.734 --> 1:17:39.204
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him!

1:17:40.531 --> 1:17:44.411
- It's true, Imelda.
- And so what if it's true?

1:17:44.577 --> 1:17:46.750
You leave me alone with a child to raise...

1:17:46.912 --> 1:17:48.915
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

1:17:49.081 --> 1:17:50.082
Imelda, I...

1:17:51.041 --> 1:17:52.293
Héctor!

1:17:55.171 --> 1:17:58.425
I'm running out of time. It's Coco.

1:17:59.717 --> 1:18:01.185
She's forgetting you.

1:18:02.511 --> 1:18:07.313
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.

1:18:09.852 --> 1:18:12.150
I wanted to forget you.

1:18:13.439 --> 1:18:16.193
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

1:18:16.358 --> 1:18:18.952
This is my fault. Not yours.

1:18:21.363 --> 1:18:23.161
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1:18:27.453 --> 1:18:32.584
Miguel, if we help you get his photo,
you will return home?

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:34.126
No more music?

1:18:35.461 --> 1:18:37.759
Family comes first.

1:18:40.132 --> 1:18:43.261
I can't forgive you.

1:18:45.429 --> 1:18:46.976
But I will help you.

1:18:50.100 --> 1:18:51.352
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

1:18:52.394 --> 1:18:54.772
I might know a way.

1:19:45.531 --> 1:19:47.625
- Good luck, <i>muchacho.</i>
- <i>Gracias,</i> Frida.

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:58.377
- Here, let me help you with...
- Don't touch me!

1:19:59.461 --> 1:20:01.634
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Héctor's photo.

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:03.640
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

1:20:03.882 --> 1:20:05.009
Got your petals?

1:20:06.719 --> 1:20:08.392
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1:20:08.554 --> 1:20:09.305
Yes?

1:20:10.764 --> 1:20:12.311
Don't I know you?

1:20:13.475 --> 1:20:15.523
That's for murdering the love of my life!

1:20:15.644 --> 1:20:17.988
- Who... Who the...
- She's talking about me!

1:20:18.147 --> 1:20:20.901
- I'm the love of your life?
- I don't know. I'm still angry at you.

1:20:21.025 --> 1:20:22.447
Héctor! How did you...

1:20:22.568 --> 1:20:25.367
And that's for trying to murder my grandson.

1:20:25.571 --> 1:20:27.323
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:31.831
You! Wait. You're related to Héctor?

1:20:32.036 --> 1:20:33.083
The photo!

1:20:37.583 --> 1:20:38.710
After him!

1:20:40.878 --> 1:20:42.926
Security! <i>Ayúdenme!</i>

1:20:43.047 --> 1:20:45.971
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

1:20:46.091 --> 1:20:47.218
That's what I heard.

1:21:01.106 --> 1:21:03.109
Places, <i>Señor.</i> You're on in thirty seconds.

1:21:09.782 --> 1:21:12.376
<i>Ay!</i> Miguel! I have it!

1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:29.722
Hurry! Come on!

1:21:31.929 --> 1:21:33.147
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1:21:33.305 --> 1:21:39.233
<i>the one... the only... Ernesto de la Cruz!</i>

1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:49.572
Get her off the stage.

1:21:58.330 --> 1:22:00.503
Sing! Sing!

1:22:06.672 --> 1:22:11.849
<i>Ay, de mi Llorona</i>

1:22:12.719 --> 1:22:17.566
<i>Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1:22:19.852 --> 1:22:23.903
<i>Ay, de mi Llorona</i>

1:22:25.190 --> 1:22:29.366
<i>Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1:22:31.822 --> 1:22:36.043
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:44.841
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

1:22:47.045 --> 1:22:50.720
<i>Me subí al pino más alto, Llorona</i>

1:22:50.883 --> 1:22:53.307
<i>A ver si te divisaba</i>

1:22:53.469 --> 1:22:57.394
<i>Como el pino era tierno, Llorona</i>

1:22:58.140 --> 1:23:01.144
<i>Al verme llorar, lloraba</i>

1:23:01.310 --> 1:23:07.943
<i>Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1:23:08.358 --> 1:23:15.162
<i>Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste</i>

1:23:15.491 --> 1:23:19.337
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

1:23:19.495 --> 1:23:22.465
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

1:23:22.581 --> 1:23:26.256
- Let go of me!
- <i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

1:23:26.877 --> 1:23:36.887
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

1:23:38.764 --> 1:23:41.267
<i>Ay, ay, ay</i>

1:23:50.150 --> 1:23:52.118
I forgot what that felt like.

1:23:52.569 --> 1:23:54.947
You still got it.

1:24:01.078 --> 1:24:03.797
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

1:24:05.457 --> 1:24:10.964
To go home, to put up our photos
and to never...

1:24:11.129 --> 1:24:12.847
Never play music again.

1:24:14.508 --> 1:24:19.230
To never forget
how much your family loves you.

1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:23.437
You're going home.

1:24:26.937 --> 1:24:28.610
You're not going anywhere.

1:24:30.566 --> 1:24:31.658
Imelda!

1:24:31.984 --> 1:24:37.286
Stay back! Stay back! All of you,
stay back. Not one more step.

1:24:39.199 --> 1:24:40.792
Dante!

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:46.211
Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone.

1:24:46.331 --> 1:24:50.461
I've worked too hard, Héctor.
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1:24:50.586 --> 1:24:52.680
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1:24:52.838 --> 1:24:54.181
He's a threat!

1:24:54.339 --> 1:24:57.843
<i>You think I'd let him go back to
the Land of the Living with your photo?</i>

1:24:57.968 --> 1:25:01.017
To keep your memory alive? No.

1:25:01.138 --> 1:25:03.562
- You're a coward!
- I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1:25:03.682 --> 1:25:05.685
The greatest musician of all time!

1:25:05.809 --> 1:25:07.652
Héctor's the real musician.

1:25:07.769 --> 1:25:10.272
<i>You're just the guy who murdered him
and stole his songs!</i>

1:25:10.355 --> 1:25:11.277
Murdered?

1:25:11.398 --> 1:25:15.323
I am the one who's willing to do
what it takes to seize my moment.

1:25:16.403 --> 1:25:17.495
Whatever it takes.

1:25:20.032 --> 1:25:21.124
No!

1:25:23.285 --> 1:25:24.503
Miguel!

1:25:25.370 --> 1:25:28.715
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

1:26:11.917 --> 1:26:13.669
Please, please, <i>mi familia.</i>

1:26:13.794 --> 1:26:15.637
Murderer!

1:26:15.754 --> 1:26:18.098
Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one...

1:26:20.926 --> 1:26:24.601
<i>Remember me Though I have to s...</i>Hey!

1:26:26.515 --> 1:26:27.562
Look!

1:26:48.370 --> 1:26:49.622
Nice kitty.

1:26:53.458 --> 1:26:58.555
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

1:27:06.930 --> 1:27:08.432
No! No!

1:27:20.444 --> 1:27:21.536
What did I miss?

1:27:21.820 --> 1:27:23.288
Good boy, Dante!

1:27:23.572 --> 1:27:24.790
Miguel!

1:27:26.241 --> 1:27:30.166
Héctor! The photo... I lost it!

1:27:30.746 --> 1:27:32.749
It's okay, <i>mijo.</i> It's o...

1:27:33.582 --> 1:27:36.085
Héctor! Héctor?

1:27:37.419 --> 1:27:38.295
Coco.

1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:40.343
No! We can still find the photo.

1:27:40.922 --> 1:27:42.549
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1:27:43.842 --> 1:27:45.344
No, no. I can't leave you.

1:27:45.635 --> 1:27:50.107
I promised I'd put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.

1:27:50.265 --> 1:27:52.268
We're both out of time, <i>mijo.</i>

1:27:53.685 --> 1:27:56.860
Oh no! No! She can't forget you!

1:27:57.022 --> 1:28:00.868
I just wanted her to know that I loved her.

1:28:01.943 --> 1:28:05.823
- Héctor!
- You have our blessing, Miguel.

1:28:05.947 --> 1:28:07.199
No conditions.

1:28:08.366 --> 1:28:11.085
No! <i>Papá</i> Héctor, please!

1:28:15.332 --> 1:28:16.379
No!

1:28:17.959 --> 1:28:21.805
- Go home.
- I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1:28:49.032 --> 1:28:50.250
There he is!

1:28:51.701 --> 1:28:53.624
Miguel! Stop!

1:28:58.750 --> 1:29:01.595
- Where have you been?
- I need to see <i>Mamá</i> Coco, please.

1:29:01.753 --> 1:29:04.427
What are you doing with that...
Give it to me!

1:29:05.090 --> 1:29:09.436
Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!

1:29:10.762 --> 1:29:14.562
<i>Mamá</i> Coco? Can you hear me? It's Miguel.

1:29:15.225 --> 1:29:18.729
I saw your <i>papá.</i> Remember? <i>Papá?</i>

1:29:20.063 --> 1:29:25.570
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

1:29:26.319 --> 1:29:27.446
Miguel, open this door!

1:29:27.612 --> 1:29:32.038
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?

1:29:34.911 --> 1:29:40.793
See? There he is! <i>Papá!</i> Remember? <i>Papá?</i>

1:29:44.462 --> 1:29:48.308
- Miguel!
- <i>Mamá</i> Coco, please! Don't forget him.

1:29:55.056 --> 1:29:57.855
What are you doing to that poor
woman? It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i> It's okay.

1:29:57.976 --> 1:29:59.478
What's gotten into you?

1:30:06.318 --> 1:30:07.991
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

1:30:08.153 --> 1:30:09.575
I'm sorry, <i>Papá.</i>

1:30:09.738 --> 1:30:12.787
We're all together now. That's what matters.

1:30:13.825 --> 1:30:14.952
Not all of us.

1:30:15.076 --> 1:30:20.253
It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i> Miguel,
you apologize to your <i>Mamá</i> Coco.

1:30:23.668 --> 1:30:25.090
<i>Mamá</i> Coco?

1:30:29.841 --> 1:30:31.593
Well? Apologize!

1:30:35.972 --> 1:30:41.775
<i>Mamá</i> Coco?
Your <i>papá,</i> he wanted you to have this.

1:30:43.688 --> 1:30:45.486
<i>Mamá,</i> wait!

1:30:45.649 --> 1:30:49.495
<i>Remember me</i>

1:30:50.820 --> 1:30:53.619
<i>Though I have to say goodbye</i>

1:30:53.782 --> 1:30:56.376
<i>Remember me</i>

1:30:57.035 --> 1:30:59.709
<i>Don't let it make you cry</i>

1:30:59.871 --> 1:31:03.375
<i>For even if I'm far away</i>

1:31:03.541 --> 1:31:09.389
<i>I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

1:31:09.506 --> 1:31:12.726
<i>Each night we are apart</i>

1:31:13.468 --> 1:31:16.813
<i>Remember me</i>

1:31:17.722 --> 1:31:20.817
<i>Though I have to travel far</i>

1:31:20.934 --> 1:31:23.608
<i>Remember me</i>

1:31:23.728 --> 1:31:27.403
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

1:31:28.733 --> 1:31:34.581
<i>Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be</i>

1:31:36.574 --> 1:31:40.875
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

1:31:42.664 --> 1:31:48.467
<i>Remember me</i>

1:31:56.094 --> 1:31:59.223
Elena? What's wrong, <i>mija?</i>

1:32:00.432 --> 1:32:04.232
Nothing, <i>Mamá.</i> Nothing at all.

1:32:05.270 --> 1:32:08.615
My <i>papá</i> used to sing me that song.

1:32:09.274 --> 1:32:11.402
He loved you, <i>Mamá</i> Coco.

1:32:12.068 --> 1:32:15.698
Your <i>papá</i> loved you so much.

1:32:34.299 --> 1:32:37.644
I kept his letters.

1:32:38.303 --> 1:32:42.558
Poems he wrote me. And...

1:33:02.077 --> 1:33:04.671
<i>Papá</i> was a musician.

1:33:05.330 --> 1:33:07.082
When I was a little girl...

1:33:09.834 --> 1:33:13.009
he and <i>Mamá</i> would sing such beautiful songs.

1:33:25.767 --> 1:33:29.863
And right over here, one of
Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.

1:33:30.105 --> 1:33:33.700
The home of the esteemed song writer,
Héctor Rivera.

1:33:34.484 --> 1:33:38.114
The letters Héctor wrote home for
his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics...

1:33:38.279 --> 1:33:41.829
for all of your favorite songs.
Not just <i>Remember Me.</i>

1:33:45.787 --> 1:33:47.881
And that man is your <i>Papá</i> Julio.

1:33:48.039 --> 1:33:51.214
And there's <i>Tía</i> Rosita and your <i>Tía</i> Victoria.

1:33:51.376 --> 1:33:54.221
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

1:33:54.879 --> 1:33:57.348
These aren't just old pictures,
they're our family...

1:33:57.507 --> 1:33:59.555
and they're counting on us to remember them.

1:34:17.402 --> 1:34:22.659
<i>Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool</i>

1:34:26.786 --> 1:34:28.709
Enjoy your visit, Héctor.

1:34:30.582 --> 1:34:33.427
<i>But last night it seemed that
I dreamed about you</i>

1:34:36.838 --> 1:34:39.762
- <i>Papá!</i>
- Coco!

1:34:39.924 --> 1:34:44.600
<i>When I opened my mouth
what came out was a song</i>

1:34:44.762 --> 1:34:50.440
<i>And you know every word and we all sang along</i>

1:34:53.980 --> 1:34:57.735
<i>To a melody played
on the strings of our souls</i>

1:34:57.901 --> 1:35:02.703
<i>And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone</i>

1:35:02.864 --> 1:35:07.620
<i>Our love for each other will live on forever</i>

1:35:09.204 --> 1:35:14.131
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

1:35:14.292 --> 1:35:18.798
<i>Our love for each other will live on forever</i>

1:35:20.131 --> 1:35:24.728
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

1:35:28.139 --> 1:35:32.190
<i>Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente</i>

1:35:32.602 --> 1:35:36.448
<i>Canten a coro
Let it be known</i>

1:35:36.606 --> 1:35:40.281
<i>Our love for each other will live on forever</i>

1:35:40.443 --> 1:35:44.448
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

1:35:45.073 --> 1:35:49.078
<i>Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente</i>

1:35:49.202 --> 1:35:52.877
<i>Canten a coro
Let it be known</i>

1:35:52.997 --> 1:35:55.045
<i>Our love for each other will live on forever</i>

1:35:57.001 --> 1:36:01.473
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>
