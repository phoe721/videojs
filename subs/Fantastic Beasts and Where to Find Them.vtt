02:13.400 --> 02:17.090
Dougal... you settle down now, please.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.590
It won't be long.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.050
Next.

02:45.740 --> 02:47.720
- British, huh? - Yes.

02:48.410 --> 02:50.260
- First trip to New York? - Yes.

02:51.390 --> 02:53.810
- Anything edible in there? - No.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.210
Livestock?

03:02.560 --> 03:05.070
Must get that fixed... ahh, no.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.670
Let me take a look.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.110
- Welcome to New York. - Thank you.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.340
Next!

03:38.560 --> 03:41.280
And it was like a... like a wind

03:41.280 --> 03:44.020
or like a... like a ghost...

03:44.070 --> 03:48.190
but dark... and I saw its eyes.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.110
Shining white eyes...

03:54.750 --> 03:57.270
A dark wind... with eyes.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.070
Like a dark mass,

04:00.280 --> 04:03.490
and it dove down there, down underground.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.170
Someone ought do something about it.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.990
It's everywhere this thing. It's out of control.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.420
- Get anything? - Dark wind, blah blah.

04:17.180 --> 04:20.240
It's some atmospheric hooey. Or electrical.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.360
- Hey, you thirsty? - Nah, I'm on the wagon.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.240
Promised Martha I'd lay off.

04:29.550 --> 04:30.910
It's atmospheric.

05:10.570 --> 05:15.470
This great city sparkles with the jewels of man's invention!

05:15.590 --> 05:18.140
Movie theaters, automobiles,

05:18.140 --> 05:21.040
the wireless, electric lights.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.360
- All dazzle and bewitch us! - So sorry.

05:24.110 --> 05:27.970
But where there is light there is shadow, friend.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.680
Something is stalking our city,

05:30.920 --> 05:32.040
wreaking destruction

05:32.040 --> 05:34.570
and then disappearing without a trace.

05:35.350 --> 05:40.040
Listen to me. We have to fight, join us,

05:40.170 --> 05:42.830
the Second Salemers, in our fight!

05:42.830 --> 05:44.350
- Excuse me, doll. - You hear me?

05:44.350 --> 05:47.000
- Just trying to get to the bank. - We have to fight together...

05:47.190 --> 05:49.400
- Excuse me, trying... - Watch it!

05:49.560 --> 05:51.410
So sorry, my case.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.070
No harm done.

05:55.240 --> 05:59.430
- Excuse me! - You, friend!

06:02.620 --> 06:04.340
What drew you to our meeting today?

06:05.430 --> 06:06.900
Oh... I was just passing.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.460
Are you a seeker?

06:09.140 --> 06:10.870
A seeker after truth?

06:12.520 --> 06:14.270
I'm more of a chaser, really.

06:16.590 --> 06:20.260
Hear my words and heed my warning.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.340
And laugh if you dare.

06:25.940 --> 06:27.920
Witches live among us!

06:28.650 --> 06:30.250
We have to fight together

06:30.250 --> 06:33.380
for the sake of our children, for the sake of tomorrow!

06:33.850 --> 06:35.550
What do you say to that, friend?

06:46.900 --> 06:47.880
Excuse me.

07:07.330 --> 07:09.330
Can I help you, sir?

07:11.590 --> 07:13.930
No, I was just... just... waiting.

07:25.070 --> 07:25.870
Hi.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.320
What brings you here?

07:30.420 --> 07:31.430
Same as you...

07:32.900 --> 07:35.670
- You're here to get a loan to open up a bakery? - Yes.

07:37.490 --> 07:38.730
What are the odds of that?

07:41.800 --> 07:44.280
- Well, may the best man win, I guess. - Excuse me.

07:46.540 --> 07:50.060
Hey, mister... Hey, mister!

07:51.770 --> 07:52.710
Hey, fella!

07:52.780 --> 07:55.440
Mr. Kowalski, Mr. Bingley will see you now.

07:57.240 --> 07:57.980
Okay...

08:00.040 --> 08:00.880
Okay.

08:24.580 --> 08:29.580
You are currently working in a canning factory?

08:29.580 --> 08:30.390
That's the best I can do...

08:30.390 --> 08:34.000
I only got back in 24'.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.540
- Got back? - From Europe, sir.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.960
Yeah... I was part of the Expeditionary Forces there.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.450
- All right. - Mr. Kowalski.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.250
You gotta try the paczki. Okay?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.240
It's my grandmother's recipe,

09:19.470 --> 09:20.880
the orange zest... just...

09:21.000 --> 09:22.210
Mr. Kowalski,

09:22.900 --> 09:26.400
what do you propose to offer the bank as collateral?

09:27.880 --> 09:29.720
- Collateral? - Collateral.

09:32.010 --> 09:33.780
There are machines now

09:33.960 --> 09:36.950
that can produce hundreds of doughnuts an hour...

09:36.950 --> 09:38.000
I know, I know,

09:38.010 --> 09:39.750
but they're nothing like what I can do.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.240
The bank must be protected, Mr. Kowalski.

09:43.740 --> 09:44.710
Good day to you.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.400
Hey, Mr. English guy!

10:08.540 --> 10:10.170
I think your egg is hatching.

10:22.410 --> 10:24.720
What? What just happened?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.010
But...

10:39.370 --> 10:40.420
Excuse me...

10:46.030 --> 10:47.050
I was... over there.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.420
I was... over there?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.180
- In you hop... - Hello?

10:56.700 --> 11:01.140
No. Everyone settle down. Stay.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.580
Dougal, don't make me come in there.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.290
Don't make me come down there.

11:08.870 --> 11:12.620
Absolutely not! Alohomora!

11:15.330 --> 11:18.420
Oh, so you're gonna steal the money, huh?

11:19.510 --> 11:20.880
Petrificus Totalus!

11:24.080 --> 11:25.050
Mr. Bingley!

11:27.480 --> 11:29.140
Kowalski!

11:34.660 --> 11:35.480
Really?

11:50.350 --> 11:54.060
No... Don't do that. Look.

11:59.890 --> 12:04.390
Oh no... No, no, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

12:05.160 --> 12:05.900
What?

12:05.980 --> 12:08.060
For the last time, you pilfering pest...

12:08.060 --> 12:10.160
paws off what doesn't belong to you.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.740
I'm awfully sorry about all that.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.390
What the hell was that?

12:17.810 --> 12:19.190
Nothing that need concern you.

12:19.370 --> 12:22.780
Now unfortunately you have seen far too much,

12:23.120 --> 12:23.760
so if you wouldn't mind...

12:23.760 --> 12:24.770
if you just stand there,

12:25.130 --> 12:27.550
- this will be over in a jiffy. - Sure, yeah.

12:30.660 --> 12:31.500
Sorry...

12:36.090 --> 12:37.010
Bugger.

12:53.930 --> 12:56.660
- Who are you? - I'm sorry?

12:56.950 --> 12:57.860
Who are you?

12:58.870 --> 13:00.210
Newt Scamander. And you are?

13:00.220 --> 13:01.530
What's that thing in your case?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.640
That's my Niffler.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.100
You've got something on your...

13:06.900 --> 13:08.300
Why in the name of Deliverance Dane

13:08.300 --> 13:09.470
did you let that thing loose?

13:09.470 --> 13:11.110
I didn't mean to, he's incorrigible,

13:11.110 --> 13:12.140
you see, anything shiny,

13:12.150 --> 13:13.520
- he's all over the place. - You didn't mean to?

13:13.520 --> 13:14.020
No.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.750
You could not have chosen a worse time to let that creature loose!

13:17.360 --> 13:19.260
We're in the middle of a situation here!

13:21.300 --> 13:22.490
I'm taking you in.

13:22.790 --> 13:24.390
You're taking me where?

13:25.160 --> 13:27.640
Magical Congress of the United States of America.

13:30.550 --> 13:32.050
So, you work for MACUSA?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.480
What are you, some kind of investigator?

13:38.170 --> 13:40.120
Can you please tell me you took care of the No-Maj?

13:40.690 --> 13:41.370
The what?

13:41.370 --> 13:46.210
The No-Maj! No-magic... the non-wizard!

13:47.160 --> 13:48.380
Oh, sorry, we call them Muggles.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.080
You wiped his memory, right?

13:50.480 --> 13:51.910
The No-Maj with the case?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.230
That's a Section 3A, Mr. Scamander.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.020
I'm taking you in.

14:09.510 --> 14:10.250
Come on.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.320
Er... sorry, but I do have things to do, actually.

14:14.610 --> 14:17.320
Well, you'll have to rearrange them!

14:18.410 --> 14:20.240
What are you doing in New York anyway?

14:20.650 --> 14:22.190
I came to buy a birthday present.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.240
Couldn't you have done that in London?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.540
No, there's only one breeder of Appaloosa Puffskeins in the world

14:27.540 --> 14:29.180
and he lives in New York, so no.

14:30.590 --> 14:31.990
I got a Section 3A.

14:35.390 --> 14:39.400
By the way, we don't allow the breeding of magical creatures in New York.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.200
We closed that guy down a year ago.

15:30.620 --> 15:31.910
Hey, Goldstein.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.630
Hey, Red.

15:37.830 --> 15:40.140
- Major Investigation Department. - I thought you was...

15:40.140 --> 15:42.710
Major Investigation Department! I got a Section 3A!

15:50.650 --> 15:52.150
The International Confederation

15:52.150 --> 15:53.740
is threatening to send a delegation.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.030
They think this is related to Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.

15:58.030 --> 16:02.210
I was there. This is a beast.

16:02.710 --> 16:06.200
No human could do what this thing is capable of, Madam President.

16:07.260 --> 16:08.970
Whatever it is, one thing's clear,

16:08.980 --> 16:10.420
it must be stopped.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.980
It's terrorizing No-Majs

16:11.990 --> 16:14.830
and when No-Majs are afraid, they attack.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.740
This could mean exposure. It could mean war.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.430
I made your position here quite clear, Miss Goldstein.

16:29.430 --> 16:31.000
Yes, Madam President, but I...

16:31.000 --> 16:32.500
You are no longer an Auror.

16:35.750 --> 16:39.740
- No, Madam President, but... - Goldstein.

16:40.400 --> 16:40.910
There's been a minor incident...

16:40.910 --> 16:44.870
Well, this office is currently concerned with very major incidents.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.530
- Get out. - Yes, ma'am.

17:13.310 --> 17:14.970
So, you got your wand permit?

17:15.050 --> 17:17.080
All foreigners have to have them in New York.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.810
I made a postal application weeks ago.

17:24.390 --> 17:28.830
Scamander... And you were just in Equatorial Guinea?

17:29.190 --> 17:30.630
I've just completed a year in the field.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.720
I'm writing a book about magical creatures.

17:33.330 --> 17:34.910
Like... an extermination guide?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.630
No. A guide to help people understand

17:37.630 --> 17:39.160
why we should be protecting these creatures

17:39.160 --> 17:39.780
instead of killing them.

17:39.780 --> 17:42.330
Goldstein! Where is she?

17:42.760 --> 17:45.010
Where is she? Goldstein!

17:46.570 --> 17:47.540
Goldstein!

17:49.510 --> 17:51.840
Did you just butt in on the Investigative Team again?

17:56.650 --> 17:58.910
- Where've you been? - What?

18:00.210 --> 18:03.480
- Where'd she pick you up? - Me?

18:05.540 --> 18:07.930
Have you been tracking them Second Salemers again?

18:08.240 --> 18:09.440
Of course not, sir.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.960
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir!

18:14.400 --> 18:16.330
Afternoon, Abernathy.

18:17.010 --> 18:19.580
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.210
He has a crazy creature in that case

18:21.210 --> 18:23.880
and it got out and caused mayhem in a bank, sir.

18:25.130 --> 18:26.400
Let's see the little guy.

18:30.050 --> 18:30.950
But, sir...

18:54.520 --> 18:55.420
Tina...

19:16.490 --> 19:17.780
I'm sorry, Grandma.

20:05.080 --> 20:09.000
My momma, your momma, gonna catch a witch.

20:09.190 --> 20:12.990
My momma, your momma, flying on a switch.

20:13.280 --> 20:17.050
My momma, your momma, witches never cry.

20:17.420 --> 20:21.240
My momma, your momma, witches gonna die!

20:21.860 --> 20:25.750
Witch number one, drown in a river!

20:26.010 --> 20:30.080
Witch number two, gotta noose to give her!

20:44.640 --> 20:48.160
Witch number three, gonna watch her burn.

20:48.670 --> 20:51.920
Witch number four, flogging take a turn.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.730
Collect your leaflets before you get food, children.

21:16.590 --> 21:18.630
Is it a witch's mark, ma'am?

21:23.430 --> 21:26.360
No. He's okay.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.220
I can't believe you didn't obliviate that man!

21:41.370 --> 21:43.210
If there's an inquiry, I'm finished!

21:43.520 --> 21:45.110
So why would you be finished? I'm the one that's...

21:45.110 --> 21:47.420
I'm not supposed to go near the Second Salemers!

21:54.200 --> 21:55.380
What was that?

21:56.860 --> 21:59.070
Er... moth, I think. Big moth.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.670
Hey, quiet down. I'm trying to get a statement.

22:05.670 --> 22:08.210
I'm telling you it's a gas explosion again.

22:08.380 --> 22:09.520
I ain't taking the kids

22:09.520 --> 22:10.950
back up there until it's safe.

22:10.950 --> 22:12.860
Sorry, ma'am. There ain't no smell of gas.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.450
It wasn't gas, Officer, I seen it!

22:14.450 --> 22:19.310
It was a... gigantic... a huge hippopotto gas.

22:19.580 --> 22:20.320
Gas.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.940
I don't know.

22:48.570 --> 22:49.700
Mr. Scamander.

23:11.580 --> 23:12.510
It was open?

23:13.270 --> 23:14.260
Just a smidge...

23:14.570 --> 23:16.530
That crazy Niffler thing's on the loose again?

23:17.540 --> 23:18.460
It might be.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.360
Then look for it!

23:21.690 --> 23:22.540
Look!

23:24.030 --> 23:26.660
His neck's bleeding, he's hurt!

23:27.680 --> 23:29.580
Wake up, Mr. No-Maj.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.360
Mercy Lewis, what is that?

23:34.990 --> 23:39.540
Nothing to worry about. That is a Murtlap.

23:41.290 --> 23:42.540
What else have you got in there?

23:44.530 --> 23:46.470
- You! - Hello.

23:47.110 --> 23:48.420
Easy, Mr...

23:48.870 --> 23:50.410
Kowalski... Jacob.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.100
You can't obliviate him!

23:52.690 --> 23:53.960
We need him as a witness.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.570
I'm sorry, you've just yelled at me the length

23:55.570 --> 23:56.870
of New York for not doing it in the first place.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.550
He's hurt! He looks ill!

23:58.550 --> 23:59.180
He'll be fine.

23:59.180 --> 24:00.690
Murtlap bites aren't serious.

24:06.190 --> 24:08.740
I admit that is a slightly more severe reaction than I've seen,

24:09.420 --> 24:11.160
but if it was really serious, he'd have...

24:13.400 --> 24:14.230
What?

24:15.770 --> 24:18.050
Well, the first symptom would be flames out of his anus...

24:18.060 --> 24:18.870
This is balled up!

24:18.870 --> 24:20.930
It'll last forty-eight hours at most!

24:20.950 --> 24:22.750
- I can keep him if you want me to. - Oh, keep him?

24:23.190 --> 24:24.310
We don't keep them!

24:25.010 --> 24:25.690
Mr. Scamander,

24:25.690 --> 24:29.650
do you know anything about the wizarding community in America?

24:29.930 --> 24:31.150
I do know a few things, actually.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.780
I know you have rather backwards laws

24:32.790 --> 24:34.570
about relations with non-magic people.

24:35.700 --> 24:36.980
That you're not meant to befriend them,

24:36.980 --> 24:37.830
that you can't marry them,

24:37.830 --> 24:38.840
which seems mildly absurd to me.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.000
Who's going to marry him?

24:41.450 --> 24:42.680
You're both coming with me.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.630
I don't see why I need to come with you.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.680
- Help me! - I'm dreaming, right?

24:47.250 --> 24:48.720
- Please. - Yeah, I'm tired,

24:48.860 --> 24:50.190
I never went to the bank.

24:51.510 --> 24:53.490
This is all just some big nightmare, right?

24:53.490 --> 24:55.310
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.480
And so this is the newsroom. Let's go.

25:58.010 --> 26:01.760
Hey, how are you? Make way for the Barebones!

26:03.270 --> 26:06.960
Now, they're just putting the papers to bed, as they say.

26:11.660 --> 26:14.470
Mr. Shaw, sir, he's with the senator.

26:14.470 --> 26:16.910
Never mind that, Barker, I wanna see my father!

26:19.750 --> 26:21.050
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your son insisted.

26:21.050 --> 26:23.380
Father, you're going to want to hear this.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.460
I've got something huge!

26:28.460 --> 26:30.640
Your brother and I are busy here, Langdon.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.560
Working on his election campaign.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.130
We don't have time for this.

26:34.130 --> 26:35.970
This is Mary Lou Barebone

26:35.970 --> 26:38.490
from the New Salem Preservation Society,

26:38.540 --> 26:40.150
and she's got a big story for you!

26:41.680 --> 26:43.320
Oh, she has, has she?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.820
There's strange things going on all over the city.

26:45.820 --> 26:48.690
The people behind this, they are not like you and me.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.790
This is witchcraft, don't you see.

26:50.790 --> 26:53.180
- Langdon. - She doesn't want any money.

26:53.890 --> 26:55.700
Then either her story is worthless,

26:55.700 --> 26:57.040
or she's lying about the cost.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.120
Nobody gives away anything valuable for free, Langdon.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.680
You are right, Mr. Shaw.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.930
What we desire is infinitely more valuable than money.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.960
It's your influence.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.110
Millions of people read your newspapers

27:08.110 --> 27:10.380
and they need to be made aware about this danger.

27:10.380 --> 27:15.380
The crazy disturbances in the subway, just look at the pictures!

27:15.380 --> 27:16.550
I'd like you and your friends to leave.

27:16.550 --> 27:18.870
No, you're missing a trick here.

27:19.230 --> 27:21.690
- Just look at the evidence. - Really.

27:21.690 --> 27:25.770
Langdon, just listen to Father and go. And...

27:27.700 --> 27:28.780
Take the freaks with you.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.790
- This is Father's office, not yours. - Okay.

27:30.790 --> 27:32.210
And I'm sick of this every time I walk in here...

27:32.210 --> 27:35.340
That's it. Thank you.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.580
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

27:42.810 --> 27:44.590
We're not difficult to find.

27:45.470 --> 27:48.940
Until then, we thank you for your time.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.820
Hey, boy.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.940
You dropped something.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.260
Here you go, freak.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.490
Why don't you put that in the trash where you all belong.

28:24.090 --> 28:25.290
Take a right here.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.700
Okay, before we go in...

28:37.720 --> 28:40.170
I'm not supposed to have men on the premises.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.710
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I can easily seek other accommodation.

28:42.710 --> 28:44.150
Oh no, you don't!

28:45.270 --> 28:46.410
Watch your step.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.010
That you, Tina?

28:56.040 --> 28:59.310
- Yes, Mrs. Esposito! - Are you alone?

28:59.720 --> 29:01.960
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito!

29:15.770 --> 29:18.700
Teenie, you brought men home?

29:20.710 --> 29:23.340
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

29:25.550 --> 29:28.560
- You want to put something on, Queenie? - Sure.

29:44.820 --> 29:48.960
- So, who are they? - That's Mr. Scamander.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.970
He's committed a serious

29:49.970 --> 29:52.500
infraction of the National Statute of Secrecy.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.970
He's a criminal?

29:54.830 --> 29:57.080
And this is Mr. Kowalski, he's a No-Maj.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.000
A No-Maj?

29:59.570 --> 30:01.100
Teen, what are you up to?

30:01.310 --> 30:03.850
He's sick, it's a long story.

30:04.700 --> 30:08.770
Mr. Scamander has lost something, I'm going to help him find it.

30:09.790 --> 30:13.300
You need to sit down, honey. Hey, he hasn't eaten all day.

30:14.890 --> 30:19.050
That's rough, he didn't get the money he wanted for his bakery.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.420
You bake, honey?

30:22.410 --> 30:24.810
- I love to cook. - You're a Legilimens?

30:24.810 --> 30:29.080
Uh-huh, yeah. But I always have trouble with your kind. Brits.

30:29.330 --> 30:30.720
It's the accent.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.890
- You know how to read minds? - Don't worry, honey.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.350
Most guys think what you was thinking, first time they see me.

30:40.170 --> 30:42.960
Now, you need food.

30:56.390 --> 30:58.630
- Hot dog... again? - Don't read my mind!

30:58.630 --> 31:00.600
Not a very wholesome lunch.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.880
Hey, Mr. Scamander,

31:19.190 --> 31:20.900
you prefer pie or strudel?

31:23.750 --> 31:25.870
I really don't have a preference.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.770
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?

31:35.110 --> 31:36.300
Strudel it is.

31:56.050 --> 31:58.060
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.550
We're not going to poison you.

32:38.710 --> 32:39.850
You're upset.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.080
It's your mother again.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.940
Somebody's said something, what did they say? Tell me.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.650
- Do you think I'm a freak? - No,

32:51.340 --> 32:52.790
I think you're a very special young man

32:52.790 --> 32:55.880
or I wouldn't have asked you to help me, would I?

33:00.720 --> 33:04.530
- Have you any news? - I'm still looking.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.220
Mr. Graves, if I knew whether it was a girl or boy...

33:11.220 --> 33:14.830
My vision showed only the child's immense power.

33:15.110 --> 33:17.510
He or she is no older than ten,

33:19.060 --> 33:21.830
and I saw this child in close proximity to your mother.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.150
She I saw so plainly.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.870
- That could be any one of hundreds. - There is something else.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.290
Something I haven't told you.

33:29.290 --> 33:31.850
I saw you beside me in New York.

33:33.460 --> 33:36.270
You're the one that gains this child's trust.

33:36.310 --> 33:39.180
You are the key, I saw this.

33:39.270 --> 33:42.360
You want to join the wizarding world.

33:42.740 --> 33:46.820
I want those things too, Credence. I want them for you.

33:48.340 --> 33:52.950
So find the child. Find the child and we'll all be free.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.030
The job ain't that glamorous.

33:57.030 --> 33:59.560
I mean, I spend most days making coffee,

33:59.560 --> 34:03.200
unjinxing the john. Tina's the career girl.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.340
Nah. We're orphans.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.200
Ma and Pa died of dragon pox when we were kids.

34:13.350 --> 34:16.550
You're sweet. But we got each other!

34:18.630 --> 34:21.350
Could you stop reading my mind for a second?

34:22.700 --> 34:25.200
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

34:27.170 --> 34:31.670
This meal, it's insanely good! This is what I do, I'm a cook.

34:31.670 --> 34:36.140
And this is, like, the greatest meal I have ever had in my life.

34:39.130 --> 34:44.050
Oh, you slay me! I ain't never really talked to a No-Maj before.

34:45.770 --> 34:46.780
Really?

34:53.930 --> 34:55.330
I am not flirting!

35:00.640 --> 35:02.460
I'm just saying, don't go getting attached,

35:02.460 --> 35:04.670
he's going to have to be obliviated!

35:05.990 --> 35:07.400
It's nothing personal.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.790
- Hey, you okay, honey? - Miss Goldstein,

35:10.790 --> 35:13.820
I think Mr. Kowalski could do with an early night.

35:13.970 --> 35:15.790
And besides, you and I will need to be up early tomorrow morning

35:15.800 --> 35:17.580
to find my Niffler, so...

35:18.980 --> 35:22.480
- What's a Niffler? - Don't ask.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.040
Okay, you guys can bunk in here.

35:41.070 --> 35:44.350
I thought you might like a hot drink?

35:56.470 --> 36:00.400
Hey, Mr. Scamander... Look, cocoa!

36:02.650 --> 36:06.470
- The toilet's down the hall to the right. - Thanks...

36:09.980 --> 36:11.770
Very much.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.080
Come on.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.400
For the love of...

37:08.470 --> 37:11.830
- Will you sit down? - Good idea.

37:16.940 --> 37:18.660
That's definitely the Murtlap.

37:18.660 --> 37:20.440
You must be particularly susceptible.

37:21.400 --> 37:25.600
See, you're a Muggle. So our physiologies are subtly different.

37:33.890 --> 37:38.010
Stay still. Now that should stop the sweating.

37:38.180 --> 37:40.070
And one of those should sort the twitch.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.630
Take that.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.830
Come on...

37:57.390 --> 38:02.390
- What you got there? - This the locals call Swooping Evil?

38:03.120 --> 38:06.990
Not the friendliest of names. It's quite an agile fellow.

38:11.090 --> 38:13.470
I've been studying him. And I am pretty sure his venom

38:13.470 --> 38:15.670
could be quite useful if properly diluted.

38:16.140 --> 38:18.470
Just to remove bad memories, you know.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.100
Probably shouldn't let him loose in here, though.

38:30.570 --> 38:31.630
Come on.

38:46.870 --> 38:49.380
Come on. Down you come.

38:55.370 --> 38:56.410
Come on.

39:04.380 --> 39:06.140
Oh, thank Paracelsus.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.840
If you'd have got out that could have been quite catastrophic.

39:11.250 --> 39:13.680
You see, he's the real reason I came to America.

39:17.970 --> 39:19.710
To bring Frank home.

39:21.940 --> 39:24.900
No, sorry, stay there, he's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.

39:26.350 --> 39:30.570
Here you are, here you are. He was trafficked, you see.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.800
I found him in Egypt, he was all chained up.

39:35.070 --> 39:37.490
Couldn't leave him there, had to bring him back.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.590
I'm going to put you back where you belong, aren't I, Frank?

39:42.190 --> 39:44.500
To the wilds of Arizona.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.980
Here they come.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.920
- Here who comes? - The Graphorns.

40:30.550 --> 40:32.180
You're all right. You're all right.

40:34.550 --> 40:37.340
Hello, hello!

40:39.760 --> 40:42.370
So they're the last breeding pair in existence.

40:42.710 --> 40:45.030
If I hadn't managed to rescue them,

40:45.030 --> 40:47.550
that could have been the end of Graphorns, forever.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.810
All right.

40:58.850 --> 41:01.670
- What, you rescue these creatures? - Yes, that's right.

41:01.670 --> 41:04.200
Rescue, nurture, and protect them,

41:04.200 --> 41:06.800
and I'm gently trying to educate my fellow wizards about them.

41:07.620 --> 41:08.680
Come on.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.440
Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?

41:26.450 --> 41:29.730
He had a cold. He needed some body warmth.

41:31.610 --> 41:32.790
Right, on you hop.

41:36.880 --> 41:41.010
See, he has some attachment issues. Now, come on, Pickett.

41:42.940 --> 41:47.030
Pickett. No, they're not going to bully you. Now, come on.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.390
Pickett!

41:50.430 --> 41:55.010
All right. But that is exactly why they accuse me of favoritism.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.210
I wonder where Dougal's gone.

41:59.800 --> 42:03.500
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming, Mum's here. Mum's here.

42:03.530 --> 42:08.530
- Hello, you, let me take a look at you. - I know these guys.

42:12.450 --> 42:15.900
- Your Occamy. - You mean my Occamy?

42:15.920 --> 42:18.150
Yes, do you want to...

42:19.760 --> 42:22.440
Yeah, sure. Okay.

42:28.820 --> 42:33.460
- Hey. - No, sorry, don't pet them.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.840
They learn to defend themselves early.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.950
See, their shells are made of silver so they're incredibly valuable.

42:38.950 --> 42:42.560
- Okay. - Their nests tend to get ransacked by hunters.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.690
Thank you.

42:45.900 --> 42:48.550
- Mr. Scamander? - Call me Newt.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.370
Newt, I don't think I'm dreaming.

42:51.550 --> 42:55.870
- What gave it away? - I ain't got the brains to make this up.

42:58.910 --> 42:59.720
Actually, would you mind

42:59.720 --> 43:02.360
throwing some of those pellets in with the Mooncalves over there?

43:04.420 --> 43:06.370
- Yeah, sure. - Just over there...

43:09.910 --> 43:14.760
Bugger, Niffler's gone. Of course he has, little bugger.

43:14.910 --> 43:17.510
Any chance to get his hands on something shiny.

43:54.870 --> 43:56.500
What did you do today, Jacob?

43:57.110 --> 43:58.650
I was inside a suitcase.

43:58.650 --> 44:03.640
Hey. Hello, fellas. All right, all right.

44:03.930 --> 44:06.840
Take it easy, take it easy.

44:14.530 --> 44:18.270
Cutie. There it is.

45:04.170 --> 45:06.400
- Step back. - Jeez...

45:06.410 --> 45:09.950
- Step back. - What's the matter with this?

45:09.950 --> 45:12.300
- I said step away. - Yeah.

45:13.060 --> 45:17.160
- What the hell is this thing? - It's an Obscurus.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.600
I need to get going,

45:20.510 --> 45:22.670
find everyone who's escaped before they get hurt.

45:22.670 --> 45:23.620
Before they could get hurt?

45:23.620 --> 45:27.130
Yes, Mr. Kowalski. They're currently in alien terrain,

45:27.130 --> 45:28.050
surrounded by millions

45:28.060 --> 45:30.150
of the most vicious creatures on the planet.

45:32.450 --> 45:33.610
Humans.

45:35.560 --> 45:38.450
So where would you say that a medium-sized creature

45:39.080 --> 45:40.740
that likes broad, open plains,

45:40.740 --> 45:44.500
trees, water holes, that kind of thing, where might she go?

45:44.500 --> 45:45.730
In New York City?

45:45.810 --> 45:47.520
- Yes. - Plains?

45:49.450 --> 45:51.630
- Central Park? - And where is that exactly?

45:51.630 --> 45:53.240
Where is Central Park?

45:57.950 --> 46:00.770
Well, look, I would come and show you,

46:00.770 --> 46:03.020
but don't you think it's kind of a double cross?

46:03.020 --> 46:06.070
The girls take us in, they make us hot cocoa.

46:06.070 --> 46:07.810
You do realize that when they see you've stopped sweating,

46:07.810 --> 46:09.370
they'll obliviate you in a heartbeat.

46:09.370 --> 46:10.350
What does obliviate Mean?

46:10.350 --> 46:13.510
It'll be like you wake up and all memory of magic is gone.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.880
- I won't remember any of this? - No.

46:25.690 --> 46:27.870
All right, yeah, okay, I'll help you.

46:32.830 --> 46:33.910
Come on, then.

46:52.030 --> 46:54.320
Credence, where have you been?

46:57.070 --> 46:59.310
I was looking for a place for tomorrow's meeting.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.180
There's a corner on Thirty-Second Street that could...

47:13.330 --> 47:16.220
I'm sorry, Ma. I didn't realize it was so late.

48:10.730 --> 48:12.520
- I was watching you at dinner. - Yeah.

48:13.810 --> 48:15.710
People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski?

48:16.320 --> 48:20.440
Well, I'm sure people like you too.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.190
No, not really. I annoy people.

48:25.960 --> 48:27.740
Why did you decide to be a baker?

48:28.300 --> 48:32.790
Well, because I'm dying in that canning factory.

48:33.090 --> 48:34.010
Everyone there's dying.

48:34.010 --> 48:36.560
It just crushes the life outta you.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.690
- You like canned food? - No.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.020
Yeah. Me neither. That's why I want to make pastries, you know.

48:42.020 --> 48:44.510
It makes people happy. We're going this way.

48:44.970 --> 48:46.410
So did you get your loan?

48:47.850 --> 48:50.700
No, I ain't got no collateral.

48:50.930 --> 48:53.100
Stayed in the army too long, apparently, I don't know.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.450
- You fought in the war? - Of course I fought in the war,

48:55.450 --> 48:57.860
everyone fought in the war. You didn't fight in the war?

48:57.860 --> 49:01.070
I worked mostly with dragons, Ukrainian Ironbellies,

49:01.300 --> 49:02.540
Eastern Front.

49:32.030 --> 49:33.140
Finestra.

50:36.030 --> 50:37.140
Accio!

50:56.940 --> 50:58.930
All right? Happy?

51:01.980 --> 51:03.930
One down, two to go.

51:13.860 --> 51:17.990
- They went that way, Officer. - Hands up!

51:21.930 --> 51:23.130
What the hell is that?

51:25.960 --> 51:27.040
Lion...

51:36.320 --> 51:41.170
You know, New York is considerably more interesting than I'd expected.

51:57.550 --> 51:58.650
Put this on.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.320
Why would I have to wear something like this?

52:02.320 --> 52:03.580
Because your skull is

52:03.580 --> 52:05.780
susceptible to breakage under immense force.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.490
But we made them cocoa.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.340
Right.

52:35.810 --> 52:40.700
- Okay, if you just, pop this on. - Okay.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.620
Now, there's absolutely nothing for you to worry about.

52:44.450 --> 52:45.180
Tell me, has anyone ever

52:45.180 --> 52:47.330
believed you when you told them not to worry?

52:47.490 --> 52:50.650
My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.

52:56.050 --> 52:59.740
She's in season. She needs to mate.

53:04.490 --> 53:07.450
Erumpent musk, she is mad for it.

54:15.930 --> 54:17.350
Good girl...

54:18.740 --> 54:21.360
Come on, into the case.

54:31.630 --> 54:32.650
Get...

54:38.680 --> 54:39.900
Oh, no.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.550
Repar...

55:12.590 --> 55:14.100
Merlin's beard!

55:20.140 --> 55:22.170
They're exactly the same.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.910
- Same thing. - Newt!

55:30.260 --> 55:31.580
No, no, no, don't!

55:33.550 --> 55:34.800
I'm so sorry.

56:32.950 --> 56:34.610
Good show, Mr. Kowalski!

56:37.760 --> 56:39.140
Call me Jacob.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.790
Two down, one to go.

56:55.540 --> 56:56.740
In you hop.

57:13.200 --> 57:14.620
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:15.050 --> 57:18.040
tonight's keynote speaker,

57:18.530 --> 57:20.980
needs no introduction from me.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.570
He's been mentioned as a future president.

57:25.450 --> 57:27.140
And if you don't believe me,

57:27.490 --> 57:29.230
just read his daddy's newspapers.

57:32.840 --> 57:33.810
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:33.810 --> 57:36.340
I'll give you the senator for New York,

57:36.340 --> 57:38.570
Henry Shaw!

57:43.810 --> 57:44.970
Thank you.

57:46.420 --> 57:47.530
Thank you!

57:52.030 --> 57:53.100
Thank you.

58:18.010 --> 58:21.650
And it's true we have made some progress,

58:22.570 --> 58:25.500
but there is no reward for idleness.

58:25.650 --> 58:29.870
So just as the odious saloons have been banished...

58:36.350 --> 58:37.670
What's going on?

58:44.260 --> 58:47.580
So now the pool halls,

58:47.580 --> 58:49.940
and these private parlors...

59:02.180 --> 59:03.500
What is that?

59:53.860 --> 59:55.120
Witches!

1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:05.330
Our American friends have

1:00:05.330 --> 1:00:08.100
permitted a breach of the Statute of Secrecy,

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:11.220
that threatens to expose us all.

1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:13.220
I will not be lectured by the man

1:00:13.220 --> 1:00:14.530
who let Gellert Grindelwald

1:00:14.530 --> 1:00:15.520
slip through his fingers.

1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:17.280
Madam President, I'm so sorry to interrupt,

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.290
but this is critical.

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:34.220
You'd better have an excellent

1:00:34.220 --> 1:00:37.020
excuse for this intrusion, Miss Goldstein.

1:00:37.530 --> 1:00:39.510
Yes, I do.

1:00:42.710 --> 1:00:47.550
Madam. Yesterday a wizard entered New York with a case.

1:00:47.970 --> 1:00:50.130
This case full of magical creatures,

1:00:50.130 --> 1:00:52.380
and unfortunately, some have escaped.

1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:54.270
He arrived yesterday?

1:00:55.710 --> 1:00:57.950
You have known for twenty-four hours

1:00:57.950 --> 1:01:01.880
that an unregistered wizard set magical beasts loose in New York.

1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:05.040
and you see fit to tell us only when a man has been killed?

1:01:07.210 --> 1:01:10.620
- Who has been killed? - Where is this man?

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:52.830
Scamander?

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.250
Hello, Minister.

1:01:56.250 --> 1:01:59.000
Theseus Scamander? The war hero?

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.510
No, this is his little brother.

1:02:01.650 --> 1:02:03.860
And what are you doing in New York?

1:02:03.950 --> 1:02:06.850
- I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskein, sir.- Right.

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:09.130
What are you really doing here?

1:02:10.270 --> 1:02:13.000
Goldstein, and who is this?

1:02:13.670 --> 1:02:15.440
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President,

1:02:15.450 --> 1:02:18.100
he's a No-Maj who got bitten by one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.

1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:20.310
- No-Maj? - Obliviated?

1:02:20.310 --> 1:02:21.690
Obliviate him!

1:02:26.050 --> 1:02:27.160
Merlin's beard.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:30.000
You know which of your creatures was responsible,

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.280
Mr. Scamander?

1:02:36.550 --> 1:02:38.150
No creature did this.

1:02:39.510 --> 1:02:40.700
Don't pretend!

1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:43.940
You must know what that was, look at the marks...

1:02:48.390 --> 1:02:49.890
That was an Obscurus.

1:02:53.030 --> 1:02:55.130
You go too far, Mr. Scamander.

1:02:55.890 --> 1:02:58.620
There is no Obscurial in America.

1:03:01.410 --> 1:03:03.310
Impound that case, Graves!

1:03:03.870 --> 1:03:05.990
- Wait. No. Give that back. - Arrest them!

1:03:10.930 --> 1:03:12.530
Don't hurt those creatures.

1:03:13.150 --> 1:03:14.170
Please, you don't understand,

1:03:14.170 --> 1:03:16.400
nothing in there is dangerous, nothing!

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:20.100
We'll be the judges of that! Take them to the cells!

1:03:20.850 --> 1:03:24.120
Don't hurt those creatures, nothing in there is dangerous!

1:03:24.340 --> 1:03:25.530
Please, don't hurt my creatures!

1:03:25.530 --> 1:03:28.720
They aren't dangerous! Please, they are not dangerous!

1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:31.020
They are not dangerous!

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.680
I am so sorry about your creatures, Mr. Scamander.

1:03:42.380 --> 1:03:43.710
I truly am.

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:46.550
Can someone please tell me

1:03:46.550 --> 1:03:50.120
what this Obscurial or Obscurus thing is? Please?

1:03:52.330 --> 1:03:54.640
There hasn't been one for centuries.

1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:58.450
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:03.430
There used to be more of them but they still exist.

1:04:07.250 --> 1:04:09.460
Before wizards went underground,

1:04:10.450 --> 1:04:12.960
when we were still being hunted by Muggles,

1:04:14.230 --> 1:04:15.590
young wizards and witches

1:04:15.590 --> 1:04:19.760
sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution.

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:24.900
Instead of learning to harness or to control their powers,

1:04:26.030 --> 1:04:28.940
they developed what was called an Obscurus.

1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:34.290
It's an unstable, uncontrollable Dark force

1:04:34.290 --> 1:04:36.380
that busts out and attacks...

1:04:39.690 --> 1:04:41.170
and then vanishes.

1:04:45.060 --> 1:04:47.390
Obscurials can't survive long, can they?

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:48.830
There's no documented case

1:04:48.830 --> 1:04:51.760
of any Obscurial surviving past the age of ten.

1:04:53.340 --> 1:04:55.770
The one I met in Africa was eight when she...

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.970
She was eight when she died.

1:05:05.870 --> 1:05:07.470
What are you telling me here,

1:05:07.470 --> 1:05:11.010
that Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

1:05:16.220 --> 1:05:19.650
My momma, your momma, flying on a switch.

1:05:19.930 --> 1:05:23.440
My momma, your momma, witches never cry.

1:05:23.710 --> 1:05:27.310
My momma, your momma, witches gonna die!

1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.020
Witch number one, drown in a river!

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:33.750
Witch number two, gotta noose to give her!

1:05:33.750 --> 1:05:36.550
- Hand out your leaflets! - Witch number three...

1:05:36.550 --> 1:05:38.340
I'll know if you dump them.

1:05:39.420 --> 1:05:41.790
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.

1:06:11.550 --> 1:06:13.760
It was good to make your acquaintance,Jacob

1:06:14.310 --> 1:06:16.080
and I hope you get your bakery.

1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:29.240
You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.

1:06:29.250 --> 1:06:30.550
Mr. Graves...

1:06:39.660 --> 1:06:42.640
You were thrown out of Hogwarts for endangering human life...

1:06:42.650 --> 1:06:45.370
- That was an accident! - With a beast.

1:06:45.890 --> 1:06:49.370
Yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion.

1:06:49.370 --> 1:06:50.510
And now...

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:56.880
What makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?

1:07:02.260 --> 1:07:03.800
I really couldn't say.

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:07.000
So setting a pack of dangerous creatures loose here was...

1:07:10.380 --> 1:07:13.150
Was just another accident, is that right?

1:07:13.330 --> 1:07:15.160
Why would I do it deliberately?

1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:16.980
To expose wizardkind.

1:07:18.290 --> 1:07:21.470
To provoke war between the magical and non-magical worlds.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:24.550
Mass slaughter for the greater good, you mean?

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:30.460
Yes. Quite.

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:35.370
I'm not one of Grindelwald's fanatics, Mr. Graves.

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:43.400
I wonder what you can tell me about this, Mr. Scamander?

1:07:57.910 --> 1:08:01.240
It's an Obscurus. But it's not what you think so.

1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:03.190
I managed to separate it from the Sudanese girl

1:08:03.190 --> 1:08:04.650
from the Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.

1:08:04.650 --> 1:08:06.820
Wanted to take it home, to study it.

1:08:06.820 --> 1:08:08.270
But it cannot survive outside that,

1:08:08.270 --> 1:08:10.290
it could not hurt anyone, Tina!

1:08:10.290 --> 1:08:12.110
So it's useless without the host?

1:08:13.290 --> 1:08:17.290
"Useless?" "Useless?"

1:08:19.610 --> 1:08:24.110
That is a parasitical magical force that killed a child.

1:08:24.110 --> 1:08:26.000
What on earth would you use it for?

1:08:32.670 --> 1:08:34.650
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

1:08:34.950 --> 1:08:36.080
You brought this Obscurus into the

1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:38.810
city of New York in the hope of causing mass disruption,

1:08:38.810 --> 1:08:41.470
breaking the Statute of Secrecy and revealing the magical world.

1:08:41.470 --> 1:08:43.320
You know that can't hurt anyone, you know that!

1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.050
You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal

1:08:45.050 --> 1:08:47.450
of your fellow wizards and are sentenced to death.

1:08:47.700 --> 1:08:49.740
Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you...

1:08:49.740 --> 1:08:51.010
No, she's done nothing of the kind.

1:08:51.010 --> 1:08:53.090
She receives the same sentence.

1:08:55.140 --> 1:08:56.970
Just do it immediately.

1:08:57.380 --> 1:08:59.670
- I will inform President Picquery myself. - Tina.

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:02.620
Please.

1:09:16.290 --> 1:09:19.070
Don't do this, Bernadette, please...

1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:21.600
It don't hurt.

1:09:59.180 --> 1:10:03.240
- Tina... - Momma... - Tina...

1:10:05.650 --> 1:10:09.880
Come on, pumpkin, time for bed. Are you ready?

1:10:10.510 --> 1:10:12.690
Don't that look good?

1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:18.690
You wanna get in?

1:10:27.950 --> 1:10:29.720
- Hey, Sam! - Hey, Queenie.

1:10:29.730 --> 1:10:31.090
They need you downstairs.

1:10:31.090 --> 1:10:33.480
- I'll obliviate this guy. - You ain't qualified.

1:10:35.140 --> 1:10:36.510
Hey, Sam.

1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:39.170
Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?

1:10:41.550 --> 1:10:43.060
- How'd you... - Let me obliviate this guy

1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:44.730
and she'll never hear about it from me.

1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:50.020
What are you doing?

1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:52.800
Teen's in trouble, I'm trying to listen...

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:54.480
Jacob, where's Newt's case?

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:56.440
I think that guy Graves took it.

1:10:56.860 --> 1:10:58.520
Okay, come on.

1:10:58.740 --> 1:11:00.320
What? You're not gonna obliviate me?

1:11:01.020 --> 1:11:04.110
Of course not, you're one of us now!

1:11:32.230 --> 1:11:33.390
It's okay.

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:45.000
Alohomora.

1:11:48.010 --> 1:11:49.310
Aberto...

1:11:50.130 --> 1:11:52.640
He would know a fancy spell to lock his office.

1:11:55.790 --> 1:11:58.740
Okay, let's get the good stuff out of you.

1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:20.490
Witch!

1:12:30.970 --> 1:12:33.830
- It's just gonna eat me! - Don't panic!

1:12:33.830 --> 1:12:35.780
What do you suggest I do instead?

1:12:41.580 --> 1:12:42.660
Jump.

1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:48.060
- Are you crazy? - Jump on him.

1:12:50.990 --> 1:12:54.230
Tina, listen to me. I'll catch you.

1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:56.990
Tina!

1:13:02.850 --> 1:13:04.090
I'll catch you.

1:13:05.910 --> 1:13:08.570
I've got you, Tina. Go!

1:13:14.330 --> 1:13:15.380
Come on!

1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:24.750
Coming through!

1:13:26.550 --> 1:13:27.510
Move!

1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:36.130
Leave his brains, come on!

1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:37.650
Come on!

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:43.120
- What is that thing? - Swooping Evil.

1:13:43.130 --> 1:13:44.600
Well, I love it!

1:13:59.850 --> 1:14:00.860
Get in.

1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:12.690
Queenie!

1:14:17.990 --> 1:14:19.260
Where you going?

1:14:21.690 --> 1:14:23.660
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.

1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:27.000
Again?

1:14:28.950 --> 1:14:30.490
Well, what've you got there?

1:14:31.350 --> 1:14:32.780
Ladies things.

1:14:33.650 --> 1:14:35.620
You wanna take a look? I don't mind.

1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:38.040
Good gravy, no! I...

1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:44.030
- You get well now! - Thanks.

1:14:58.230 --> 1:14:59.760
Credence. Have you found the child?

1:15:02.150 --> 1:15:03.330
I can't.

1:15:04.330 --> 1:15:05.410
Show me.

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:18.370
My boy, the sooner we find this child,

1:15:18.380 --> 1:15:21.360
the sooner you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.

1:15:23.870 --> 1:15:25.950
I want you to have this, Credence.

1:15:26.930 --> 1:15:30.070
I would trust very few with it.

1:15:32.390 --> 1:15:33.550
Very few.

1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.280
But you...

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:41.730
You're different.

1:15:43.050 --> 1:15:44.780
When you find the child,

1:15:44.790 --> 1:15:47.370
touch this symbol and I will know, and I will come to you.

1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:55.160
Do this and you will be honored among wizards.

1:15:55.970 --> 1:15:57.260
Forever.

1:15:59.950 --> 1:16:02.260
The child is dying, Credence.

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.190
Time is running out.

1:16:20.260 --> 1:16:24.220
Your grandfather kept pigeons? Mine bred owls.

1:16:25.590 --> 1:16:27.590
I used to love feeding them.

1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:31.540
Graves always insisted the disturbances were caused by a beast.

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:33.040
We need to catch all your creatures

1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:35.230
so he can't keep using them as a scapegoat.

1:16:35.230 --> 1:16:36.920
There's only one still missing.

1:16:37.380 --> 1:16:38.840
Dougal, my Demiguise.

1:16:39.510 --> 1:16:40.550
Dougal?

1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:42.930
Slight problem is that...

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:44.950
He's invisible.

1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:51.720
- Invisible? - Yes, most of the time... He does...

1:16:55.070 --> 1:16:57.340
- How do you catch something that...? - With immense difficulty.

1:17:08.110 --> 1:17:10.070
- Gnarlak! - Excuse me?

1:17:10.070 --> 1:17:13.750
Gnarlak, he was an informant of mine when I was an Auror!

1:17:14.710 --> 1:17:17.590
He used to trade in magical creatures on the side.

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:21.240
He wouldn't happen to have an interest in paw prints, would he?

1:17:23.340 --> 1:17:26.000
He's interested in anything he can sell.

1:18:00.410 --> 1:18:04.970
*When the dragon snapped up his best girl*

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:09.260
*And the Billywig forgot to twirl*

1:18:10.070 --> 1:18:13.940
*When his sweetheart left him cold*

1:18:14.170 --> 1:18:19.030
*And the unicorn done lost his horn*

1:18:21.350 --> 1:18:23.050
How do I get a drink in this joint?

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:27.210
What? Ain't you ever seen a house-elf before?

1:18:27.910 --> 1:18:31.710
No, no, of course I have. I love house-elves.

1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:33.780
My uncle's a house-elf.

1:18:35.420 --> 1:18:36.530
Yeah...

1:18:39.570 --> 1:18:42.740
Six shots of gigglewater and a lobe blaster, please.

1:18:50.260 --> 1:18:52.060
Are all No-Majs like you?

1:18:53.130 --> 1:18:55.570
No, I'm the only one like me.

1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:16.580
I've arrested half of the people in here.

1:19:17.310 --> 1:19:19.000
You can tell me to mind my own business, but...

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:22.480
I saw something in that death potion back there.

1:19:24.380 --> 1:19:27.160
I saw you hugging that Second Salem boy.

1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:29.170
His name's Credence.

1:19:30.980 --> 1:19:32.350
His mother beats him.

1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:36.810
She beats all those kids she adopted,

1:19:36.810 --> 1:19:38.730
but she seems to hit him the most.

1:19:41.010 --> 1:19:42.870
And she was the No-Maj you attacked?

1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:46.270
That's how I lost my job.

1:19:47.590 --> 1:19:50.660
I went for her in front of a meeting of her crazy followers.

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:53.250
They all had to be obliviated.

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:54.520
It was a big scandal.

1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:55.990
It's him.

1:20:04.430 --> 1:20:05.390
So...

1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:11.310
You're the guy with the case full of monsters, huh?

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:13.270
News travels fast.

1:20:14.980 --> 1:20:16.310
I was hoping you'd be able

1:20:16.310 --> 1:20:18.840
to tell me if there have been any sightings.

1:20:20.340 --> 1:20:21.750
Tracks. That sort of thing.

1:20:23.830 --> 1:20:26.590
You've got a big price on your head, Mr. Scamander.

1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:32.120
Why should I help you instead of turning you in?

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:34.490
I take it I'll have to make it worth your while?

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:37.730
Let's consider it a cover charge.

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:46.140
MACUSA's offering more than that.

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:50.990
Lunascope?

1:20:53.940 --> 1:20:55.240
I got five.

1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:04.370
Frozen Ashwinder egg.

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:05.990
You see, now we're...

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:08.720
Wait a minute.

1:21:11.620 --> 1:21:15.200
That's Bow... That's a Bowtruckle, right?

1:21:16.570 --> 1:21:17.400
No.

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:19.540
Come on. They pick locks, am I right?

1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:21.330
You're not having him.

1:21:25.630 --> 1:21:28.410
Good luck getting back alive, Mr. Scamander,

1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:30.800
what with the whole of MACUSA on your back.

1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:33.950
All right.

1:21:43.390 --> 1:21:44.300
Pickett...

1:21:56.710 --> 1:22:00.110
Something invisible's been wreaking havoc around Fifth Avenue.

1:22:00.690 --> 1:22:03.420
You may wanna check out Macy's department store.

1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:04.970
Might help with what you're looking for.

1:22:04.970 --> 1:22:05.880
Dougal.

1:22:06.260 --> 1:22:07.260
One last thing.

1:22:08.540 --> 1:22:11.160
There's a Mr. Graves who works at MACUSA.

1:22:11.970 --> 1:22:14.050
I was wondering what you knew of his background.

1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:16.000
You ask a lot of questions,

1:22:16.790 --> 1:22:17.840
Mr. Scamander.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.450
That can get you killed.

1:22:24.980 --> 1:22:26.370
MACUSA are coming!

1:22:26.970 --> 1:22:28.060
You tipped them off!

1:22:36.290 --> 1:22:37.500
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak...

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.570
Reminds me of my foreman!

1:23:14.460 --> 1:23:15.910
What are you doin? Credence?

1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:24.760
Where'd you get this?

1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:27.750
Give it back, Credence. It's just a toy!

1:23:32.870 --> 1:23:33.990
What is this?

1:23:38.550 --> 1:23:39.550
Take it off!

1:24:05.220 --> 1:24:07.260
- Ma... - I am not your Ma!

1:24:09.940 --> 1:24:14.940
Your mother was a wicked, unnatural woman!

1:24:16.420 --> 1:24:20.750
- It was mine. - Modesty...

1:24:33.570 --> 1:24:34.850
What is this?

1:25:27.350 --> 1:25:29.610
So Demiguises are fundamentally peaceful,

1:25:30.250 --> 1:25:32.870
but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.

1:25:34.770 --> 1:25:37.300
You two, head that way.

1:25:37.910 --> 1:25:40.020
And try very hard not to be predictable.

1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:46.940
Was that the Demiguise?

1:25:47.290 --> 1:25:51.020
No, I think it might be the reason that the Demiguise is here.

1:26:06.010 --> 1:26:08.260
Its sight operates on probability,

1:26:08.470 --> 1:26:11.660
so it can foresee the most likely immediate future.

1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:17.730
- So what's it doing? - It's babysitting.

1:26:19.270 --> 1:26:22.190
- What did you just say? - This is my fault.

1:26:24.140 --> 1:26:24.830
I thought I had them all,

1:26:24.830 --> 1:26:27.860
but I must have miscounted.

1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:34.170
It was babysitting that?

1:26:47.460 --> 1:26:49.730
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:53.220
So they grow to fill available space.

1:26:58.220 --> 1:26:59.240
Mummy's here.

1:27:20.750 --> 1:27:22.050
We need an insect,

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:25.710
any kind of insect and a teapot!

1:27:26.830 --> 1:27:28.070
Find a teapot!

1:27:51.910 --> 1:27:53.440
I got it. I got it!

1:27:57.100 --> 1:27:58.080
Teapot!

1:28:11.470 --> 1:28:13.790
Roach in teapot...

1:29:08.980 --> 1:29:10.200
Choranaptyxic.

1:29:11.850 --> 1:29:14.020
They also shrink to fit the available space.

1:29:19.910 --> 1:29:20.970
Tell me the truth.

1:29:23.070 --> 1:29:23.760
Was that everything that

1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:26.870
- came out of the case? - That's everything.

1:29:28.810 --> 1:29:29.940
And that's the truth.

1:29:34.150 --> 1:29:37.620
- Here she comes. - Happy to be home?

1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:39.950
Bet you're exhausted, buddy.

1:29:39.950 --> 1:29:43.880
Come on. There you go, that's right.

1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:13.050
Right. I think we need to talk.

1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:19.800
I wouldn't have let him keep you, Pickett.

1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:22.930
Pick, I would rather chop off my hand than get rid of you.

1:30:22.930 --> 1:30:25.120
After everything you have done for me, now come on.

1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.770
Pick, we've talked about sulking before, haven't we?

1:30:30.630 --> 1:30:31.550
Pickett...

1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.260
Come on, give me a smile.

1:30:35.910 --> 1:30:36.890
Pickett, give me a...

1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:42.200
All right. Now, that is beneath you.

1:30:50.220 --> 1:30:51.260
Newt.

1:30:53.580 --> 1:30:56.830
- Who is she? - That's no one.

1:30:59.100 --> 1:31:00.510
Leta Lestrange?

1:31:02.170 --> 1:31:03.620
I've heard of that family.

1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:07.640
Aren't they kinda, you know?

1:31:07.730 --> 1:31:09.080
Please don't read my mind.

1:31:21.220 --> 1:31:22.830
Sorry, I asked you not to.

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:25.020
I know, I'm sorry.

1:31:26.590 --> 1:31:27.650
I can't help it.

1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:30.190
People are easiest to

1:31:30.190 --> 1:31:32.520
- read when they're hurting. - I'm not hurting.

1:31:34.200 --> 1:31:35.750
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

1:31:45.140 --> 1:31:47.490
That was a real close friendship you had at school.

1:31:50.530 --> 1:31:52.330
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:56.320
- So we became quite... - You became real close.

1:31:58.890 --> 1:31:59.830
For years.

1:32:04.470 --> 1:32:09.330
She was a taker. You need a giver.

1:32:10.410 --> 1:32:14.060
- What are you two talking about? - Nothing.

1:32:14.790 --> 1:32:16.760
- School. - School.

1:32:18.140 --> 1:32:21.930
Did you say school? Is there a school?

1:32:22.070 --> 1:32:25.570
A wizardry school here? In America?

1:32:25.570 --> 1:32:27.870
Of course, Ilvermorny!

1:32:27.870 --> 1:32:30.620
It's only the best wizard school in the whole world!

1:32:30.620 --> 1:32:31.610
I think you'll find the best

1:32:31.610 --> 1:32:34.100
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts!

1:32:35.230 --> 1:32:36.720
Hogwash!

1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:47.870
Danger.

1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:52.380
He senses danger.

1:33:32.300 --> 1:33:35.020
The Obscurial was here?

1:33:36.050 --> 1:33:37.070
Where did she go?

1:33:39.390 --> 1:33:43.050
Help me. Help me.

1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:48.220
Didn't you tell me you had another sister?

1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:51.710
Please help me.

1:33:52.510 --> 1:33:53.270
Where's your other sister,

1:33:53.270 --> 1:33:54.560
- Credence? - Please, help me.

1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:57.090
- The little one? Where did she go? - Please...

1:34:00.830 --> 1:34:03.700
Your sister's in grave danger.

1:34:05.420 --> 1:34:06.570
We need to find her.

1:34:16.070 --> 1:34:19.650
- What is this place? - Ma adopted Modesty out of here.

1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:21.640
From a family of twelve.

1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:24.000
She misses her brothers and sisters.

1:34:24.010 --> 1:34:25.610
She still talks about them.

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:29.290
Where is she?

1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:32.760
I don't know.

1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:36.270
You're a Squib, Credence.

1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:39.810
I could smell it off you the minute I met you.

1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:41.880
What?

1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:45.710
You have magical ancestry, but no power.

1:34:47.090 --> 1:34:48.620
But you said you could teach me.

1:34:48.620 --> 1:34:49.860
You're unteachable.

1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:53.500
Your mother's dead. That's your reward.

1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:56.190
I'm done with you.

1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:06.300
Modesty?

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:19.610
Modesty.

1:35:21.310 --> 1:35:25.180
There's no need to be afraid.

1:35:26.970 --> 1:35:29.400
I'm here with your brother, Credence.

1:35:34.500 --> 1:35:35.820
Out you come, now.

1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:15.690
Credence, I owe you an apology.

1:36:16.830 --> 1:36:18.180
I trusted you.

1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:25.450
I thought you were my friend. That you were different.

1:36:27.950 --> 1:36:31.490
You can control it, Credence.

1:36:36.990 --> 1:36:39.090
But I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.

1:37:03.350 --> 1:37:07.170
Jeez. Is that the Obscuriathing?

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:11.760
That's more powerful than any Obscurial I have ever heard of.

1:37:16.070 --> 1:37:19.440
If I don't come back, look after my creatures.

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:23.680
Everything that you need to know is in there.

1:37:24.610 --> 1:37:25.530
What?

1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:27.250
They're not killing it.

1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:34.120
Newt! You heard him, look after them!

1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:39.120
- Keep holda that, honey. - No, no, no!

1:37:41.220 --> 1:37:45.510
I can't take you. Please let go of me, Jacob!

1:37:47.190 --> 1:37:49.160
You're the one that said I was one of youse,

1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:52.120
- right? - It's too dangerous.

1:38:22.850 --> 1:38:27.850
To survive so long, with this inside you, Credence,

1:38:29.970 --> 1:38:33.830
is a miracle. You are a miracle.

1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:39.270
Come with me, think of what we could achieve together.

1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:55.110
Newt!

1:38:55.170 --> 1:38:56.370
It's the Second Salem boy.

1:38:56.370 --> 1:38:57.770
He's the Obscurial.

1:38:58.020 --> 1:38:59.160
He's not a child.

1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:01.380
His power must be so strong,

1:39:01.380 --> 1:39:03.810
he's somehow managed to survive.

1:39:08.190 --> 1:39:11.480
Newt! Save him.

1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:20.300
Mr. Graves.

1:39:33.510 --> 1:39:35.700
Tina. You're always turning up where you are least wanted.

1:39:48.500 --> 1:39:51.420
Contain this, or we are exposed

1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:52.890
and it will mean war.

1:40:03.610 --> 1:40:04.610
Credence!

1:40:05.770 --> 1:40:07.140
Credence, I can help you.

1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:47.970
- Bar the area. - Yes, sir.

1:41:47.970 --> 1:41:49.450
I don't want anyone else down there!

1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:03.250
Credence...

1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:07.870
It's Credence, isn't it?

1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.520
I'm here to help you, Credence.

1:42:14.730 --> 1:42:16.290
I'm not here to hurt you.

1:42:36.530 --> 1:42:38.290
I've met someone just like you,

1:42:38.290 --> 1:42:39.150
Credence.

1:42:42.530 --> 1:42:43.450
A girl.

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:47.920
A young girl who'd been imprisoned,

1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:51.470
she had been locked away

1:42:51.470 --> 1:42:53.960
and she'd been punished for her magic.

1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:13.150
Credence...

1:43:16.630 --> 1:43:17.950
Can I come over to you?

1:43:21.810 --> 1:43:22.870
Can I come over?

1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:56.600
That thing killed my son. I want justice!

1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:01.420
I'll expose you for who you are and what you've done.

1:44:25.170 --> 1:44:26.910
Look! Take... Take photos.

1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:56.000
Credence.

1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:36.590
Credence, no!

1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:45.810
Don't do this. Please.

1:45:47.420 --> 1:45:48.910
Keep talking, Tina.

1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:54.460
Keep talking to him, he'll listen to you. He's listening.

1:45:57.520 --> 1:45:59.500
I know what that woman did to you.

1:46:03.970 --> 1:46:05.590
I know that you've suffered.

1:46:08.450 --> 1:46:10.400
You need to stop this now.

1:46:13.010 --> 1:46:15.180
Newt and I will protect you.

1:46:17.980 --> 1:46:22.030
This man... He is using you.

1:46:22.030 --> 1:46:23.640
Don't listen to her, Credence.

1:46:24.490 --> 1:46:26.200
I want you to be free.

1:46:27.780 --> 1:46:31.530
- It's all right. - That's it.

1:46:42.090 --> 1:46:44.430
- Don't, you'll frighten him. - Wands down!

1:46:45.100 --> 1:46:47.880
Anyone harms him, they'll answer to me. Credence!

1:46:47.890 --> 1:46:49.210
Credence...

1:46:51.410 --> 1:46:53.360
- No. - No!

1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:31.800
Credence... You fools.

1:47:34.140 --> 1:47:35.840
Do you realize what you've done?

1:47:36.210 --> 1:47:38.920
The Obscurial was killed on my orders,

1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:40.780
- Mr. Graves. - Yes.

1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:44.650
And history will surely note that, Madam President.

1:47:45.700 --> 1:47:47.460
What was done here tonight was not right!

1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:50.120
He was responsible for the death of a No-Maj.

1:47:50.330 --> 1:47:52.390
He risked the exposure of our community.

1:47:52.390 --> 1:47:54.260
He has broken one of our most sacred laws.

1:47:54.260 --> 1:47:58.000
A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter!

1:47:58.070 --> 1:48:00.680
A law that demands that we conceal our true nature!

1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:03.970
A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear

1:48:03.970 --> 1:48:05.820
lest we risk discovery!

1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:10.390
I ask you, Madam President.

1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:13.450
I ask all of you...

1:48:15.690 --> 1:48:17.450
Who does this law protect?

1:48:19.870 --> 1:48:21.050
Us?

1:48:23.290 --> 1:48:24.650
Or them?

1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:33.950
I refuse to bow down any longer.

1:48:33.980 --> 1:48:35.220
Aurors,

1:48:35.890 --> 1:48:38.360
I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves of his wand

1:48:38.530 --> 1:48:40.320
and escort him back to...

1:49:13.690 --> 1:49:14.850
Accio.

1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:25.960
Revelio.

1:49:50.860 --> 1:49:53.170
Do you think you can hold me?

1:49:55.300 --> 1:49:56.780
We'll do our best,

1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:58.710
Mr. Grindelwald.

1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:18.730
Will we die, just a little?

1:50:32.860 --> 1:50:35.840
I figured somebody oughta keep an eye on this thing.

1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:42.000
Thank you.

1:50:42.010 --> 1:50:44.080
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander.

1:50:45.300 --> 1:50:47.760
But the magical community is exposed!

1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:51.320
We cannot obliviate an entire city.

1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:00.650
Actually, I think we can.

1:51:26.820 --> 1:51:29.640
I was intending to wait until we got to Arizona,

1:51:32.910 --> 1:51:34.070
but it seems like now

1:51:34.070 --> 1:51:35.480
you are our only hope, Frank.

1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:56.290
I'll miss you too.

1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:10.360
You know what you've got to do.

1:54:38.310 --> 1:54:39.800
They won't remember anything.

1:54:41.010 --> 1:54:44.090
That venom has incredibly powerful obliviative properties.

1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:48.960
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.

1:54:52.220 --> 1:54:55.710
Now, get that case out of New York.

1:54:56.340 --> 1:54:57.750
Yes, Madam President.

1:55:04.270 --> 1:55:06.370
Is that No-Maj still here?

1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:14.620
Obliviate him. There can be no exceptions.

1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:19.020
I'm sorry, but even one witness.

1:55:19.140 --> 1:55:20.480
You know the law.

1:55:24.530 --> 1:55:25.980
I'll let you say good-bye.

1:55:41.550 --> 1:55:42.950
This is for the best.

1:55:43.740 --> 1:55:45.770
Yeah, I was,

1:55:46.820 --> 1:55:49.020
I was never even supposed to be here.

1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.840
I was never supposed to know any of this.

1:55:59.500 --> 1:56:01.400
Everybody knows Newt only kept me around

1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:02.750
because...

1:56:05.330 --> 1:56:08.050
Newt, why did you keep me around?

1:56:09.610 --> 1:56:10.850
Because I like you.

1:56:13.530 --> 1:56:15.550
Because you're my friend

1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:17.950
and I'll never forget

1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:19.530
how you helped me, Jacob.

1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:25.280
I'll come with you.

1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:29.100
We'll go somewhere, we'll go anywhere.

1:56:30.580 --> 1:56:34.520
See, I ain't never gonna find anyone like you.

1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:39.050
There's loads like me.

1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:41.710
No. No.

1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:44.840
There's only one like you.

1:56:51.130 --> 1:56:52.430
I gotta go.

1:56:57.500 --> 1:57:01.070
- Jacob! - It's okay. It's okay.

1:57:04.010 --> 1:57:05.180
It's okay.

1:57:10.090 --> 1:57:11.740
It's just like waking up, right?

1:59:15.300 --> 1:59:16.780
So sorry, sorry!

1:59:34.230 --> 1:59:35.770
Dear Mr. Kowalski,

1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:38.270
you are wasted in a canning factory.

1:59:41.450 --> 1:59:43.210
Please take these Occamy eggshells

1:59:43.220 --> 1:59:44.650
as collateral for your bakery.

1:59:45.110 --> 1:59:46.380
A well-wisher.

2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:12.560
- It's been... - Hasn't it?

2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:21.120
Listen, Newt, I wanted to thank you.

2:00:21.780 --> 2:00:23.100
What on earth for?

2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:26.900
Well, you know, if you hadn't said

2:00:26.900 --> 2:00:28.990
all those nice things to Madam Picquery about me,

2:00:28.990 --> 2:00:31.320
I wouldn't be back on the investigative team now.

2:00:32.910 --> 2:00:33.750
Well, I can't think of

2:00:33.750 --> 2:00:36.010
anyone that I'd rather have investigating me.

2:00:39.150 --> 2:00:42.750
- Try not to need investigating for a bit. - I will.

2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:44.780
Quiet life for me from now on.

2:00:45.530 --> 2:00:47.240
Back to the Ministry.

2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:50.210
- Deliver my manuscript. - I'll look out for it.

2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:53.230
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

2:00:59.570 --> 2:01:01.820
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:08.130
- Who? - The girl whose picture you carry.

2:01:10.710 --> 2:01:11.710
I don't really know

2:01:11.710 --> 2:01:16.650
what Leta likes these days, because people change.

2:01:17.550 --> 2:01:19.160
- Yes. - I've changed.

2:01:21.130 --> 2:01:24.570
I think. Maybe a little.

2:01:34.830 --> 2:01:37.050
I'll send you a copy of my book, if I may.

2:01:38.020 --> 2:01:39.320
I'd like that.

2:01:58.220 --> 2:01:59.200
I'm so sorry.

2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:02.470
How would you feel if I gave you your copy in person?

2:02:05.430 --> 2:02:06.760
I'd like that.

2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:11.360
Very much.

2:03:29.050 --> 2:03:30.670
Where do you get your ideas from,

2:03:30.670 --> 2:03:32.650
- Mr. Kowalski? - I don't know.

2:03:32.670 --> 2:03:36.220
I don't know. They just come.

2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:40.380
Here you go. Don't forget this. Enjoy.

2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:43.920
Hey, Henry, storage, all right?

2:03:44.310 --> 2:03:45.580
Thanks, pal.
