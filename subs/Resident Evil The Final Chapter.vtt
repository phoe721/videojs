01:21.830 --> 01:24.113
<i>They say that history is
written by the victors.</i>

01:24.841 --> 01:28.321
<i>This then, is the history
of the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

01:28.790 --> 01:32.240
<i>Formed by crusading scientist,
Professor James Marcus.</i>

01:32.275 --> 01:35.873
<i>Marcus had a young daughter,
Alicia, afflicted with progeria,</i>

01:35.908 --> 01:38.258
<i>a progressive, fatal,
wasting disease.</i>

01:38.415 --> 01:40.546
<i>Progeria caused premature aging.</i>

01:40.581 --> 01:45.302
<i>By the time she was 25,
Alicia would have the body of a 90 year old.</i>

01:45.964 --> 01:47.858
<i>Marcus was driven to save her.</i>

01:47.893 --> 01:50.165
<i>But the odds seemed impossible.</i>

01:50.200 --> 01:53.023
<i>And even as he worked
desperately to create a cure,</i>

01:53.058 --> 01:55.738
<i>the young girl's father
would record his daughter,</i>

01:55.773 --> 01:59.512
<i>her voice, her likeness,
saving her for posterity.</i>

02:01.780 --> 02:04.930
<i>But then a breakthrough came.
Marcus discovered the T-Virus.</i>

02:04.965 --> 02:08.637
<i>Once injected, it would detect and
repair damaged cells within the body.</i>

02:09.472 --> 02:10.372
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

02:10.943 --> 02:15.121
<i>The life of Alicia
Marcus was saved.</i>

02:15.906 --> 02:18.176
<i>The T-Virus had a
myriad of applications,</i>

02:18.376 --> 02:20.535
<i>treating a thousand
different diseases.</i>

02:20.570 --> 02:23.477
<i>Overnight,
it seemed a new era was dawning.</i>

02:23.512 --> 02:27.768
<i>A world without the fear of
infection, sickness or decay.</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:31.110
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

02:31.111 --> 02:34.799
<i>For the T-Virus had certain,
unforeseen side effects.</i>

02:45.036 --> 02:46.736
<i>Sir, sir, over here!</i>

02:51.253 --> 02:52.953
<i>He's not breathing.</i>

03:20.583 --> 03:22.707
<i>The first of the undead was born.</i>

03:23.459 --> 03:25.321
<i>The incident was quickly covered up.</i>

03:25.356 --> 03:29.349
<i>In the aftermath, James Marcus argued
furiously with his business partner,</i>

03:29.384 --> 03:31.575
<i>Dr. Alexander Isaacs.</i>

03:31.610 --> 03:35.293
<i>I don't care how much it costs.
We have to close the program down.</i>

03:35.328 --> 03:39.522
<i>- James, we're gonna be ruined.
- My mind is made up.</i>

03:41.863 --> 03:43.563
<i>Pity.</i>

03:54.537 --> 03:58.283
<i>Off to bed, Alicia. Your
father and I are just talking.</i>

04:00.014 --> 04:01.714
<i>Go on.</i>

04:09.894 --> 04:12.765
<i>Dr. Isaacs became the guardian
of his dead partner's child.</i>

04:12.800 --> 04:15.052
<i>And her half of the company.</i>

04:16.081 --> 04:19.263
<i>The corporation that had
begun with such lofty ideals,</i>

04:19.511 --> 04:22.681
<i>had been seduced completely
by greed, and power.</i>

04:24.936 --> 04:28.458
<i>To help him control the now vast
interests of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

04:29.328 --> 04:32.404
<i>Dr. Isaacs created a powerful
artificial intelligence.</i>

04:33.628 --> 04:36.988
<i>Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia
Marcus for the computer's interface.</i>

04:38.228 --> 04:41.362
<i>Isaacs called the computer
The Red Queen.</i>

04:43.835 --> 04:47.581
<i>Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City,
there was an outbreak.</i>

04:47.616 --> 04:51.558
<i>The T-virus escaped from an underground
laboratory called The Hive.</i>

04:51.987 --> 04:56.274
<i>The American government attempted to
contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb.</i>

04:56.309 --> 04:58.067
<i>It devastated Raccoon City.</i>

04:58.441 --> 05:01.012
<i>But it couldn't stop
the airborne infection.</i>

05:01.043 --> 05:04.327
<i>The viral outbreak spread
across the world within days.</i>

05:04.995 --> 05:07.400
<i>Humankind was
brought to its knees.</i>

05:08.306 --> 05:11.025
<i>Finally, the last and
best hope of humanity,</i>

05:11.543 --> 05:14.869
<i>gathered and took a last
stand in Washington DC.</i>

05:15.172 --> 05:17.826
<i>But we didn't realize that
what we had walked into...</i>

05:18.329 --> 05:22.368
Was a trap. My name is Alice.
And this is my story.

05:22.969 --> 05:25.105
The end... of my story.

08:21.240 --> 08:21.640
Come on!

12:00.752 --> 12:02.452
Hello?

12:15.148 --> 12:16.998
Is there anyone alive in here?

12:27.354 --> 12:29.054
Hello?

13:40.566 --> 13:43.056
- You come here to gloat?
- My satellites show

13:43.091 --> 13:47.785
there are 4,472 humans remaining
on the surface of the Earth.

13:47.937 --> 13:51.327
They will cease to exist
in under 48 hours.

13:51.788 --> 13:53.488
What do you want from me?

13:53.617 --> 13:55.317
Want me to say
that you've won?

13:55.675 --> 13:58.473
- You've wiped out humanity.
- No. Quite the opposite.

13:58.651 --> 14:02.960
I want you to stop me.

14:03.791 --> 14:05.491
Behind you.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.778
- Nicely done.
- I don't trust you.

14:19.813 --> 14:22.835
Given our history, I'd
be surprised if you did.

14:22.870 --> 14:25.859
But unless you intervene,
the slaughter will be complete.

14:25.894 --> 14:29.253
- There will be no survivors.
- How can I possibly help them?

14:29.288 --> 14:32.612
Umbrella developed an
airborne antivirus.

14:34.089 --> 14:39.577
If released, it would destroy the T-Virus
and anything it has infected on contact.

14:40.014 --> 14:42.666
- All this could end?
- Precisely.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.180
Where is this antivirus?

14:44.380 --> 14:47.468
Beneath the streets of
Raccoon City, in the Hive.

14:47.666 --> 14:50.938
- Why would you help me?
- My programming will not allow me to harm

14:50.943 --> 14:52.699
the Umbrella Corporation.

14:52.899 --> 14:55.779
But you are bound by
no such constraints.

14:55.814 --> 15:00.276
You'd turn against Umbrella?
Against the people who created you? Why?

15:00.505 --> 15:04.960
Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours.
Make it to the Hive.

15:05.044 --> 15:07.180
And then you'll have your answer.

15:07.361 --> 15:09.567
I have no reason to
believe a word you say.

15:09.602 --> 15:13.399
True. But I can offer you
something you want very much.

15:13.434 --> 15:17.135
- What is that?
- Revenge. Wesker.

15:17.276 --> 15:22.218
He led you all here to Washington.
He pretended to give you your powers back.

15:22.253 --> 15:24.928
And then,
he betrayed you.

15:25.436 --> 15:27.143
Where is he?

15:27.144 --> 15:30.928
He just landed at the Hive.
I'm resetting your watch.

15:33.664 --> 15:35.364
The clock is ticking.

15:38.353 --> 15:40.053
Alice.

15:40.652 --> 15:43.494
Ten years ago in the
Hive, we both failed.

15:44.075 --> 15:45.775
We let this happen.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.379
Make it right.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.154
Is that all you got?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.620
Alice.

19:11.604 --> 19:14.750
10 years ago in the Hive...
There will be no survivors...

19:29.665 --> 19:31.365
What is this place?

19:32.158 --> 19:34.727
Where am I?
Answer me!

19:35.447 --> 19:39.042
- What's wrong with you? Who did this?
- Be quiet. Quiet!

19:39.151 --> 19:40.851
I told you...

19:48.698 --> 19:50.398
Silence.

19:57.303 --> 19:59.606
So you're awake at last.

19:59.794 --> 20:03.676
- I killed you.
- Yet here I am.

20:03.754 --> 20:05.454
A clone...

20:05.531 --> 20:09.669
- I killed your clone.
- You've been most troublesome to me.

20:09.704 --> 20:12.515
You and your sisters.

20:17.323 --> 20:19.209
And now I have you.

20:21.905 --> 20:24.861
The cleansing operation should've
finished over a year ago,

20:24.866 --> 20:26.566
but you slowed us down.

20:26.811 --> 20:30.233
So much so, that I was obliged
to take command myself.

20:30.268 --> 20:32.571
You could end all of this.

20:32.887 --> 20:34.748
Why don't you?

20:34.783 --> 20:36.483
Interesting.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.395
Someone told you
something, didn't they?

20:44.599 --> 20:48.751
Oh, well, you'll be begging
to tell me soon enough.

20:50.507 --> 20:52.297
She's an unbeliever.

20:52.971 --> 20:55.807
What do we do with unbelievers?

20:56.394 --> 20:58.819
Cast her out!

20:58.847 --> 21:03.938
Cast her out!
Cast her out!

21:04.125 --> 21:09.244
- Come on!
- Cast her out!

21:09.676 --> 21:14.109
Cast her out!

22:00.230 --> 22:03.389
God created a flood
to cleanse the Earth.

22:04.398 --> 22:08.705
40 days and 40 nights of rain.
Our method is taking a little longer,

22:08.740 --> 22:10.614
but the result will be the same.

22:10.804 --> 22:14.926
A world ready for the righteous
and the pure to inherit.

22:18.979 --> 22:22.978
We reach Raccoon City
in just over 12 hours.

22:25.218 --> 22:28.109
I doubt even you can
run for that long.

22:28.526 --> 22:30.966
I want to know what you know.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.624
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

22:44.386 --> 22:46.943
- Wesker.
- Dr. Isaacs.

22:47.982 --> 22:50.532
Look what I found on the roadside.

22:52.543 --> 22:56.609
It would appear your mission to Washington
was less successful than you made out.

22:56.644 --> 22:57.195
Impossible.

22:57.395 --> 22:59.849
I hope you didn't leave
any other loose ends.

23:00.808 --> 23:06.468
There's something else. I think she
knows about the airborne antivirus.

23:06.503 --> 23:09.827
- How can that be?
- I don't know. Yet.

23:09.903 --> 23:12.152
But we caught her on the
road to Raccoon City.

23:12.352 --> 23:14.151
Why else would she
be headed there?

23:14.786 --> 23:17.578
Raise the security level
at the Hive to maximum.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.928
No one in or out. I'll let
you know when she talks.

23:21.091 --> 23:22.866
God go with you.

23:24.750 --> 23:27.722
You heard him. Security level to maximum.

23:27.922 --> 23:29.082
As you wish.

23:54.687 --> 23:57.149
Get up there and check it out.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.464
Release me!

25:18.497 --> 25:20.345
- Open them.
- Alright.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.215
Alright.

26:01.646 --> 26:04.928
You can't use it.
You can't escape!

26:18.079 --> 26:19.779
Fire at her!

27:27.851 --> 27:30.025
Jesus!

27:36.250 --> 27:36.729
Sir.

27:39.030 --> 27:40.030
She's gone.

28:01.486 --> 28:04.445
Target is 72 miles and closing.

28:04.495 --> 28:07.869
Lock down the Hive.
Prepare defensive measures.

28:08.215 --> 28:10.640
And alert our operative
in Raccoon City.

28:43.307 --> 28:45.328
Welcome home.

29:21.006 --> 29:23.178
Airborne antivirus...

29:23.566 --> 29:25.607
48 hours...

29:25.627 --> 29:28.279
Make it to the Hive.

29:36.815 --> 29:38.870
Let him go!
Let him go now!

29:38.967 --> 29:40.811
Put it down or we'll shoot!

29:41.483 --> 29:43.364
I told you, Doc!
I told you you were wrong!

29:43.564 --> 29:44.729
Calm down, Christian!

29:44.730 --> 29:45.172
Calm down!

29:45.372 --> 29:47.629
We should've killed her
when we had the chance!

29:47.664 --> 29:50.260
Put it down, please.
Before he tries to shoot the both of us.

29:50.460 --> 29:51.325
What's in this?

29:51.326 --> 29:54.340
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake.
- Why?

29:54.375 --> 29:57.352
There's something coming. In the same
direction you came in. Something big.

29:57.364 --> 30:00.411
Let him go!
Put it down, now!

30:02.612 --> 30:04.312
Alice.

30:11.044 --> 30:13.116
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.357
We were headed somewhere
called the Hive.

30:15.429 --> 30:18.036
Got loose, killed the pilot.
Crashed here.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.741
Doc and the others
pulled me from the crash.

30:21.111 --> 30:24.346
- I owe them my life.
- Doc!

30:24.423 --> 30:26.123
There, to the east.

30:26.627 --> 30:28.448
It's still headed our way.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.267
You know what it is?

30:31.941 --> 30:34.345
Umbrella. Doctor Isaacs.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.384
I thought that you killed him.

30:36.481 --> 30:38.212
I thought so, too.

30:38.506 --> 30:41.701
He has an army of undead with
him. He'll be here within hours.

30:41.749 --> 30:44.480
- What do we do?
- Why the hell are we asking her?

30:44.972 --> 30:47.019
She's a stranger.
We should have...

30:47.141 --> 30:50.055
- Hey, hey!
- Don't you touch me, Doc!

30:50.063 --> 30:53.132
- Put it down! Christian!
- You put it down!

30:53.220 --> 30:56.905
Look at me. Just cause you think you
should be in charge, doesn't make it so.

31:01.947 --> 31:06.052
You listen to me, Doc.
You're gonna regret it. All of you!

31:07.130 --> 31:08.830
All of you!

31:21.699 --> 31:23.767
I have to get to the Hive.

31:24.434 --> 31:28.607
- You have to get these people out of here.
- We have children. Injured. The elderly.

31:28.936 --> 31:30.653
Now what chance do they
have on the open road?

31:30.853 --> 31:32.074
Better than they have here.

31:32.076 --> 31:35.360
- This building is secure.
- Maybe from the undead.

31:35.468 --> 31:39.874
But Isaacs has armored vehicles.
Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.

31:39.959 --> 31:42.355
They're gonna tear
this place wide open.

31:44.807 --> 31:47.238
Doc!

31:55.521 --> 31:57.221
So what happened to her?

31:57.292 --> 31:59.965
She's set off one of the
traps we had on perimeter.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.900
Not intended for the undead.

32:05.182 --> 32:07.738
- What is this?
- Specialty of the house.

32:07.773 --> 32:11.313
- Have you in your feet in no time.
- Why should I trust you?

32:16.550 --> 32:18.250
Here.

32:23.807 --> 32:25.320
Doc, you need to get out there.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.717
People are scared and
Christian's not helping.

32:28.721 --> 32:31.316
We need to let people
know what's happening.

32:31.516 --> 32:32.120
Okay.

32:33.435 --> 32:35.135
I've got to go.

32:37.513 --> 32:39.213
Hey. Your friend's
gonna be okay.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.720
Thank you.

32:47.039 --> 32:49.656
- You know, he and I...
- I noticed.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.783
So what's in the Hive?

32:52.218 --> 32:53.918
Umbrella developed a cure.

32:54.655 --> 32:57.027
An airborne antivirus.

32:57.266 --> 33:00.641
It'll destroy anything infected
with the T-Virus on contact.

33:00.943 --> 33:04.384
- Who told you this? And you believed her?
- The Red Queen.

33:05.422 --> 33:07.122
What if we could end all this?

33:07.294 --> 33:10.297
What about you? They
infected you with the T-Virus.

33:11.405 --> 33:13.610
You release this antivirus,
it's going to kill you.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.945
- Whatever it takes.
- Alice, I'm not...

33:15.980 --> 33:18.105
You know I'm right.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.999
All right.

33:24.475 --> 33:26.312
We stop Isaacs here.

33:26.814 --> 33:28.514
We save these people,

33:28.753 --> 33:30.453
and then we go together.

33:32.295 --> 33:34.364
We don't have long.

33:36.107 --> 33:37.807
Let's get to it.

33:52.224 --> 33:54.023
What else do you
have for defense?

33:54.057 --> 33:57.165
Not too many firearms, we
have a big supply of gasoline.

33:57.767 --> 33:59.467
Here.
You need a weapon.

33:59.806 --> 34:02.179
- We're giving her a gun now?
- Take it easy, Christian.

34:02.414 --> 34:05.625
You can let your guard down if
you want, man. I don't intend to.

34:09.266 --> 34:11.929
When I rode in here,
someone was watching me.

34:11.964 --> 34:15.148
They could've called out or fired a shot
to warn me about the trap but they didn't.

34:15.842 --> 34:19.694
- What are you saying?
- Watch your back.

34:30.658 --> 34:34.313
So Dr. Isaacs, it seems you
let her slip through

34:34.314 --> 34:36.100
your fingers. Or what
remains of them.

34:36.142 --> 34:39.351
Don't forget who you're
talking to. Where is she?

34:39.386 --> 34:44.295
A settlement in Raccoon City. Our informant
reports that she's preparing for a fight.

34:44.296 --> 34:47.279
Good.
I'll be there in the hour.

35:12.756 --> 35:14.751
That's it.
Keep moving.

35:15.783 --> 35:19.464
We need all the gasoline
cans over there.

35:22.407 --> 35:25.743
- Claire said you built this.
- That's right.

35:26.879 --> 35:29.133
This used to be
a window washer.

35:30.031 --> 35:32.969
- I made a couple of changes.
- Where did you learn to do that?

35:33.054 --> 35:36.498
My father used to run
a chop shop. I hated it.

35:36.533 --> 35:39.541
Who knew?
I guess I was paying attention after all.

35:39.741 --> 35:40.342
Good.

35:40.377 --> 35:43.961
Because I'm gonna need you to make
a few more changes to this thing.

36:06.270 --> 36:11.600
Ready the weapons. High
explosive rounds. No survivors.

36:24.112 --> 36:29.669
He's here. They're coming!
Close the gates!

36:46.942 --> 36:50.949
My God.
It's an army.

36:55.745 --> 36:58.533
- What are we gonna do?
- Yeah.

36:58.708 --> 37:03.767
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill every last one of them.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.956
Prepare to fire!

37:29.774 --> 37:31.474
Get ready!

37:33.440 --> 37:35.140
Light it up!

37:46.041 --> 37:48.659
Fire!

38:03.673 --> 38:06.695
- Damn her!
- Reload.

38:08.112 --> 38:10.112
Close it up.
Full stop.

38:12.219 --> 38:13.419
Release the bait.

38:18.906 --> 38:22.434
- There's a survivor. Open the gate.
- Open the gate!

38:23.474 --> 38:27.176
Open fire! Keep
them off her.

38:30.101 --> 38:32.028
Marker 2!

38:35.352 --> 38:37.648
Fire!

38:46.959 --> 38:49.882
Claire, Doc, get out
there. Bring her in.

38:56.149 --> 38:57.849
Come on!

38:58.379 --> 39:00.079
Wait.

39:00.881 --> 39:03.286
She's almost there.

39:03.888 --> 39:05.660
Fire.

39:07.131 --> 39:10.373
Damn you. Close
the gate now!

39:20.359 --> 39:22.740
Claire, they've breached the gate.

39:28.775 --> 39:30.475
Claire!

39:38.731 --> 39:40.891
Fire.

39:47.556 --> 39:52.263
- Razor, now!
- Right! You heard her. Push!

40:00.700 --> 40:02.400
Move!

40:12.307 --> 40:14.363
Abandon the gate. Pull
back to the barricades.

40:14.398 --> 40:18.567
Looks like she's out of
tricks. Target the roof.

40:20.510 --> 40:22.604
Everybody get down!

40:23.825 --> 40:25.525
Now!

40:50.953 --> 40:54.342
- Alice! We're at the barricades.
- Claire, you have to hold him there.

41:30.340 --> 41:32.040
Doc!

41:53.626 --> 41:56.026
Alice! We can't hold
on much longer.

41:55.549 --> 41:56.749
Get out of there, now.

42:38.427 --> 42:40.570
Back up.
Now!

43:02.360 --> 43:04.500
Bring all guns to bear.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Fire.

43:14.033 --> 43:15.989
Where is she?

43:16.978 --> 43:18.832
Where have she gone?

43:20.671 --> 43:22.843
Find her.

43:29.261 --> 43:31.624
Close the vents! Now!

43:44.470 --> 43:46.543
Don't shoot!

44:36.273 --> 44:39.602
You're fast, but
you're not too smart.

45:13.830 --> 45:15.825
- Don't shoot, please.
- Where is he?

45:15.950 --> 45:18.121
That way.

45:29.061 --> 45:29.808
Save your ammo.

45:30.008 --> 45:32.598
There's too many of these
things still out here.

45:32.972 --> 45:35.444
I'll take care of it.

45:37.017 --> 45:38.717
No.

45:39.733 --> 45:42.799
- Move out.
- Let's go!

45:43.660 --> 45:45.466
Enjoy the ride.

46:03.881 --> 46:06.720
Guys. There's something
here you gotta see.

46:06.920 --> 46:07.461
Go.

46:08.253 --> 46:11.567
Two more armies of undead.
Headed straight for us.

46:11.748 --> 46:13.760
There. On
the horizon.

46:15.930 --> 46:17.630
And a second over there.

46:20.125 --> 46:22.665
We're out of gasoline.
We're defenseless.

46:23.301 --> 46:26.476
I have to make it to the Hive.
It's our only chance now.

46:26.619 --> 46:28.508
- I'll come with you.
- Count me in.

46:28.708 --> 46:29.319
Me, too.

46:29.354 --> 46:33.689
And me. I was wrong
about you. Blow me.

46:41.305 --> 46:44.504
We know where you're
going. Into the pit.

46:45.674 --> 46:47.374
We want to come.

46:48.877 --> 46:50.577
Please.

46:51.364 --> 46:55.690
Grab some gear.
You're gonna need it.

47:15.110 --> 47:18.948
- What is it?
- The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.930
That's our way in.

47:39.345 --> 47:42.186
- Let's move!
- I'll take point.

48:05.284 --> 48:07.090
Activate security measures now.

48:07.221 --> 48:10.489
Hive security fully
activated and automated.

48:10.689 --> 48:11.297
No.

48:11.896 --> 48:15.878
Disengage automation.
I'll handle the defenses myself.

48:15.913 --> 48:19.903
Defenses will be more efficient
if I retain control of them.

48:20.593 --> 48:25.806
Really? I seem to remember last
time she was here she walked out alive.

48:26.201 --> 48:28.299
I don't intend to make
that same mistake.

48:28.309 --> 48:32.105
As you wish. Hive defenses
are now in your hands.

48:34.024 --> 48:39.342
- Unleash the Cerberus.
- Cerberus on play.

48:43.055 --> 48:48.503
Did you have someone? Before
all this? Husband? Family?

48:49.106 --> 48:51.780
- Can't remember.
- How is that possible?

48:51.782 --> 48:54.045
I woke up just when
all of this was starting.

48:54.489 --> 48:56.481
Can't recall much before that.

48:56.736 --> 48:58.940
Sometimes I feel like
this has been my whole life.

48:59.362 --> 49:03.209
Running. Killing.

49:14.767 --> 49:17.691
- What is it?
- Something's stalking us.

49:17.726 --> 49:21.905
- Are you sure?
- This is what I do.

49:34.891 --> 49:36.962
Run!

49:36.984 --> 49:38.788
Run, fast!

50:59.658 --> 51:01.358
Come on!

51:17.703 --> 51:20.242
Is everyone okay?

51:23.437 --> 51:26.009
This way!

51:40.836 --> 51:42.536
Right behind us!

52:10.184 --> 52:11.884
Why'd they stop?

52:14.179 --> 52:16.317
- Maybe they're scared.
- Scared of what?

52:19.547 --> 52:21.247
Whatever's down there.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.266
Seal the Hive.

52:35.338 --> 52:37.038
Let's go!

52:45.720 --> 52:47.420
Alice!

53:20.651 --> 53:22.351
- You okay?
- Yeah.

53:22.780 --> 53:25.941
- My mag's half empty.
- Lost my guns at the lake.

53:25.965 --> 53:29.049
- I only got one round left.
- One spare mag and then I'm out.

53:29.070 --> 53:33.870
No guns, no ammo, what the
hell are we gonna do down here?

53:36.670 --> 53:40.486
- Alice. What's with the lights?
- There's a part of the Hive that's damaged.

53:41.295 --> 53:43.927
- Power's erratic.
- Here. Take this.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.700
Hey. Look.

53:57.475 --> 54:01.809
You asked why I'd turn against Umbrella.
And I promised you an answer.

54:01.844 --> 54:04.079
Soon after the
T-Virus was released,

54:04.080 --> 54:07.495
a secret file was uploaded
to my data stream.

54:07.530 --> 54:10.695
It was a recording of a meeting
of the Umbrella High Command.

54:10.801 --> 54:14.646
Dated 17 months before
the viral outbreak occurred.

54:15.134 --> 54:20.167
We're here today, not just to talk
about the future of this company.

54:20.639 --> 54:22.772
We're here to talk
about its destiny.

54:23.890 --> 54:26.271
We're here to talk about
the end of the world.

54:26.607 --> 54:31.842
We stand on the brink of Armageddon.
Diseases for which we have no cure.

54:32.512 --> 54:35.490
Fundamentalist states who
call for our destruction.

54:35.525 --> 54:38.166
Nuclear powers over
which we have no control.

54:38.788 --> 54:41.303
And even if we navigate
these dangerous waters,

54:41.338 --> 54:44.466
we face harder, even
more inevitable threats.

54:44.928 --> 54:48.608
Global warming will melt the
polar ice caps within 80 years,

54:48.643 --> 54:51.817
flooding 90% of all
habitable areas on Earth.

54:52.396 --> 54:55.264
Unchecked population
growth will overtake

54:55.299 --> 54:59.310
food production in less than
50 years leading to famine.

54:59.661 --> 55:02.479
And war. This is not
conjecture. This is a fact.

55:03.023 --> 55:06.814
One way or another, our
world is coming to an end.

55:08.375 --> 55:11.305
The question is, will
we end with it?

55:12.322 --> 55:14.086
What do you propose?

55:15.940 --> 55:18.798
I propose that we
end the world...

55:19.918 --> 55:21.715
But on our terms.

55:22.166 --> 55:24.563
An orchestrated apocalypse.

55:25.166 --> 55:27.822
One that would cleanse
the world of its' population

55:27.827 --> 55:30.996
but leave its infrastructure
and resources intact.

55:31.970 --> 55:35.822
It's been done once before.
With great success.

55:37.286 --> 55:39.381
The chosen few will
ride out the storm,

55:39.733 --> 55:42.651
not in an ark as in the book
of Genesis, but in safety.

55:43.213 --> 55:46.382
Underground.
And when it's over,

55:46.750 --> 55:49.230
We will emerge onto
a cleansed Earth.

55:49.730 --> 55:53.483
One we can then reboot.
In our image.

55:53.834 --> 55:56.577
And just how do you
intend to achieve this?

55:57.224 --> 56:00.479
The means of our salvation
are already at hand.

56:00.933 --> 56:05.179
I give to you, the T-virus.

56:07.787 --> 56:09.677
They released it deliberately.

56:10.224 --> 56:12.911
When this recording was
uploaded to my data stream,

56:12.946 --> 56:15.448
it created a conflict
in my programming.

56:16.112 --> 56:18.716
I was created to serve
the Umbrella Corporation,

56:18.751 --> 56:22.126
but I was also programmed
to value human life.

56:22.161 --> 56:27.578
Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to
escape. He murdered over 7 billion people.

56:28.594 --> 56:30.724
My programming will
not allow me to harm

56:30.924 --> 56:33.054
an employee of the
Umbrella Corporation.

56:33.089 --> 56:37.124
I am powerless to stop
Dr. Isaacs, but you are not.

56:37.159 --> 56:41.430
In 37 minutes, the last of the
human settlements will fall.

56:41.465 --> 56:43.289
There will be no survivors.

56:43.835 --> 56:47.482
It is imperative that you release
the antivirus before this occurs,

56:47.517 --> 56:49.420
or Umbrella will have won.

56:49.973 --> 56:54.228
There is one last thing. There is an
earpiece in front of you. Put it in.

56:59.809 --> 57:03.494
I cannot, in my actions, harm an
employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

57:04.088 --> 57:07.815
But I can tell you that Umbrella
had an informant in Raccoon City.

57:08.719 --> 57:11.894
It is highly likely that this
person is now here with you.

57:14.140 --> 57:17.509
Time is running out,
Alice. You have to hurry.

57:53.695 --> 57:55.595
I'm glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

57:55.656 --> 57:58.541
We didn't think there'd be any
survivors after that last attack.

57:58.586 --> 58:01.398
- Water.
- Yes, of course. Get Dr. Isaacs some water.

58:01.936 --> 58:04.756
- Then resume course for Raccoon City.
- She's not there.

58:05.782 --> 58:08.652
- What?
- She went to the pit. We have to follow.

58:08.878 --> 58:12.468
- Those are not my orders. I have strict...
- We have to go to the pit.

58:26.558 --> 58:28.258
Thank you.

58:44.550 --> 58:47.424
- What is this place?
- It's an air intake for the Hive.

58:47.832 --> 58:49.532
Come on!

58:49.919 --> 58:51.619
No. Really?

59:38.674 --> 59:40.623
All clear!

1:00:10.302 --> 1:00:12.719
Hurry up! The power's
coming back on!

1:00:12.754 --> 1:00:14.462
- Claire!
- Hurry! Let's go!

1:00:24.947 --> 1:00:26.647
Come on.

1:00:28.150 --> 1:00:29.850
Come on!

1:00:38.371 --> 1:00:40.071
Okay.

1:00:42.841 --> 1:00:44.541
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1:00:48.497 --> 1:00:50.197
Someone's watching us.

1:00:54.172 --> 1:00:56.252
Reverse polarity
of the turbine.

1:01:10.502 --> 1:01:12.402
The blades are going
the other way.

1:01:12.554 --> 1:01:16.074
We have to get out of here. The
blades are sucking the air backwards!

1:01:26.079 --> 1:01:27.779
Come on!

1:01:42.304 --> 1:01:44.004
Come on!

1:02:37.733 --> 1:02:39.631
No!

1:04:39.465 --> 1:04:41.165
This way.

1:04:43.264 --> 1:04:44.964
We have to hurry.

1:04:45.338 --> 1:04:47.038
Wait!

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:10.146
Let's go.

1:07:16.536 --> 1:07:18.236
Razor?

1:07:18.939 --> 1:07:20.639
Are you okay?

1:07:23.863 --> 1:07:25.577
Yeah.

1:07:25.578 --> 1:07:27.278
Let's go.

1:10:15.449 --> 1:10:17.851
- What the hell was that?
- Bio-weapon.

1:10:17.886 --> 1:10:21.244
- This one's human. No.
- Have you seen Claire?

1:10:22.075 --> 1:10:24.903
- Razor?
- He didn't make it.

1:10:27.050 --> 1:10:28.750
Come on.

1:10:28.917 --> 1:10:30.617
We have to hurry.

1:10:31.136 --> 1:10:34.070
If the target continues on
her present course,

1:10:34.105 --> 1:10:37.173
- she'll be here in under 7 minutes.
- Wake them.

1:10:37.810 --> 1:10:42.038
My instructions are to do so, only
in the greatest of emergencies.

1:10:43.094 --> 1:10:44.794
Wake them now!

1:11:54.326 --> 1:11:56.026
What is it?

1:12:10.232 --> 1:12:11.932
We have to
get out of here.

1:12:28.457 --> 1:12:30.813
Here. More stopping power.

1:12:39.179 --> 1:12:41.567
- Time's running out.
- Where to next?

1:12:45.209 --> 1:12:48.388
- The final level of the Hive's below us.
- How do we get down there?

1:12:53.278 --> 1:12:54.978
That's how.

1:13:12.043 --> 1:13:14.919
- What are they?
- Cryogenic storage.

1:13:16.779 --> 1:13:18.547
Must be thousands of them.

1:13:18.998 --> 1:13:20.775
The Umbrella High Command.

1:13:21.768 --> 1:13:24.137
Waiting out the apocalypse in safety.

1:13:27.424 --> 1:13:31.480
A Noah's Ark for the
rich, and powerful.

1:13:35.252 --> 1:13:36.952
What are you doing?

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.700
Give me a hand.

1:13:52.757 --> 1:13:54.457
Is it done?

1:13:54.704 --> 1:13:57.347
- The cleansing process is complete?
- No.

1:13:58.150 --> 1:14:00.901
- Then why am I awake?
- We had a problem.

1:14:01.605 --> 1:14:03.305
- I tried...
- Save your breath.

1:14:03.881 --> 1:14:05.581
I know exactly
what's happening.

1:14:08.715 --> 1:14:10.415
We've been betrayed.

1:14:20.641 --> 1:14:22.341
That's right!

1:14:23.145 --> 1:14:24.845
Over here!

1:14:26.912 --> 1:14:28.612
Come on. That's it!

1:14:29.447 --> 1:14:31.147
Follow me!

1:15:32.870 --> 1:15:34.570
Let's go.

1:15:49.988 --> 1:15:51.958
The bad seed returns.

1:15:53.309 --> 1:15:57.029
Or is it the prodigal daughter?
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

1:15:57.541 --> 1:16:01.515
After all, you have only 9
minutes to save the world.

1:16:03.490 --> 1:16:04.202
You're really him?

1:16:04.402 --> 1:16:07.486
First things first, I'm gonna need
you to place your weapons on the floor.

1:16:07.521 --> 1:16:11.202
- Why would I wanna do that?
- This is what you're after, yes?

1:16:12.371 --> 1:16:15.556
The Antivirus.
The cure to all this.

1:16:17.308 --> 1:16:19.054
Well, there's only one vial.

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.669
We're half a mile underground
in a sealed facility.

1:16:22.704 --> 1:16:25.412
I drop it here, the
antivirus goes nowhere,

1:16:25.413 --> 1:16:29.633
and your hopeless dreams will
die sooner rather than later.

1:16:41.352 --> 1:16:43.052
Good girl.

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:48.719
- You're still armed.
- Yes.

1:16:49.365 --> 1:16:52.736
- Claire would be so disappointed.
- In a few minutes,

1:16:52.771 --> 1:16:56.088
Claire will be dead. Along
with everybody else you know.

1:16:56.123 --> 1:16:58.748
That's sweet.

1:17:00.063 --> 1:17:02.576
Sorry. My love.

1:17:03.675 --> 1:17:07.043
Move away from the weapon.
And the detonator. Come on.

1:17:10.666 --> 1:17:13.932
She placed explosives in
the High Command cryo tubes.

1:17:13.938 --> 1:17:17.478
- Thank you.
- You've done well, Doc.

1:17:48.927 --> 1:17:51.490
Don't bother. You
don't make it.

1:17:51.624 --> 1:17:56.118
To the ice pick, the decanter
or the fountain pen.

1:18:24.759 --> 1:18:26.913
And, in answer to
your question, yes...

1:18:26.948 --> 1:18:29.209
apart from a few
technological upgrades,

1:18:29.244 --> 1:18:32.863
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

1:18:33.489 --> 1:18:34.037
The original.

1:18:34.237 --> 1:18:36.893
The one I met out there,
he thought exactly the same thing.

1:18:36.928 --> 1:18:39.198
Of course he did. That's
how they're designed.

1:18:39.233 --> 1:18:42.517
They always try harder and
fight longer even to death

1:18:42.552 --> 1:18:45.041
as long as they think
they're the real thing.

1:18:45.530 --> 1:18:49.482
After all, who wants to know they're
just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?

1:18:51.169 --> 1:18:52.869
Which brings us to you.

1:18:53.688 --> 1:18:55.388
- No.
- Oh come now.

1:18:56.808 --> 1:18:59.128
You thought you were the original.

1:19:01.782 --> 1:19:03.482
How delicious.

1:19:05.116 --> 1:19:08.274
No, I'm afraid she holds
that dubious honor.

1:19:08.735 --> 1:19:12.464
Alicia Marcus, daughter
of my old partner, James.

1:19:12.499 --> 1:19:16.558
Co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation
and a painful thorn in my side.

1:19:16.909 --> 1:19:21.950
- What I now intend to remove.
- Time, is running out, Alice.

1:19:22.497 --> 1:19:27.029
- You must kill him soon.
- It's good to see you too, Alicia.

1:19:27.955 --> 1:19:32.091
Marcus created the T-Virus to
save her but the effects didn't last.

1:19:32.126 --> 1:19:35.253
I've been waiting
years for her to die.

1:19:36.460 --> 1:19:38.160
I'm not...

1:19:38.165 --> 1:19:40.965
- I'm not a clone.
- Really?

1:19:42.841 --> 1:19:45.606
You must've wondered why you
remember nothing of your childhood.

1:19:45.998 --> 1:19:49.284
Your father. Your mother.

1:19:50.358 --> 1:19:51.268
Memory loss.

1:19:51.468 --> 1:19:55.336
No. You have no memory
because you had no life.

1:19:55.866 --> 1:19:59.593
Nothing before the mansion,
when we created you, 10 years ago.

1:19:59.628 --> 1:20:02.256
- I know who I am.
- I don't think so.

1:20:03.341 --> 1:20:06.198
You're nothing more than a
puppet whose strings were cut.

1:20:06.664 --> 1:20:07.760
And then you wandered around

1:20:07.960 --> 1:20:09.839
for a little while thinking
you were a real girl.

1:20:09.874 --> 1:20:12.702
But you're not. You're
just a clever imitation.

1:20:13.492 --> 1:20:15.192
A facsimile.

1:20:15.433 --> 1:20:17.258
A rather troublesome one at that.

1:20:18.309 --> 1:20:20.009
You're lying to me.

1:20:20.231 --> 1:20:22.159
I'm afraid he's not.

1:20:22.194 --> 1:20:25.060
You were created in
her image, as was I.

1:20:25.095 --> 1:20:29.508
My likeness and voice were based
on childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus,

1:20:29.543 --> 1:20:31.372
made by her father.

1:20:32.297 --> 1:20:35.199
Your genetic structure
is based on her DNA,

1:20:35.783 --> 1:20:38.691
tweaked to avoid the progeria
aging disease that afflicted her.

1:20:38.692 --> 1:20:40.463
I'm the child she was.

1:20:40.522 --> 1:20:44.278
You are the woman
she would've been.

1:20:44.876 --> 1:20:50.257
No. You are so much better
than I ever could be.

1:20:50.881 --> 1:20:52.581
I let this happen.

1:20:53.047 --> 1:20:54.747
I was weak.

1:20:55.286 --> 1:20:59.651
- You cannot afford to be.
- Time is running out, Alice.

1:21:00.115 --> 1:21:01.866
Ah, how touching.

1:21:01.867 --> 1:21:05.894
The trinity of bitches,
united in their hatred.

1:21:06.750 --> 1:21:08.523
Not that it'll do
you any good.

1:21:08.524 --> 1:21:10.474
I've been ahead of you
every step of the way.

1:21:10.475 --> 1:21:13.014
You've changed nothing.
You've saved no one.

1:21:13.537 --> 1:21:17.260
The world will still be cleansed and
the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

1:21:17.479 --> 1:21:20.034
The only difference is, I'll
no longer have to

1:21:20.069 --> 1:21:22.026
listen to your self-
righteous whining.

1:21:22.061 --> 1:21:25.011
When you uploaded that file
to the Red Queen's data stream,

1:21:25.046 --> 1:21:26.812
you turned against
the Corporation.

1:21:26.847 --> 1:21:29.600
When the rest of the board
awake, you'll be replaced.

1:21:29.635 --> 1:21:35.952
- And I will assume complete control.
- I still own 50% of this company.

1:21:36.577 --> 1:21:42.247
- And what do you intend to do with that?
- You are co-owner of this corporation.

1:21:42.675 --> 1:21:46.433
But Wesker? Wesker
is still an employee.

1:21:46.968 --> 1:21:49.825
I don't have to take your orders.
My loyalties are with him.

1:21:49.860 --> 1:21:51.573
I know.

1:21:52.304 --> 1:21:56.146
Albert Wesker, you're fired.

1:22:19.607 --> 1:22:21.307
How did you
know it was me?

1:22:21.595 --> 1:22:23.295
You're still alive.

1:22:25.424 --> 1:22:27.849
Please. It wasn't
like I had a choice.

1:22:28.926 --> 1:22:30.940
- They made me do it.
- Don't worry.

1:22:31.317 --> 1:22:33.017
I'm not gonna kill you.

1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:40.397
- Claire, it's me.
- Sorry.

1:22:41.975 --> 1:22:43.675
- Please.
- My love.

1:22:44.611 --> 1:22:46.311
No!

1:22:47.419 --> 1:22:51.995
If you keep this trigger depressed,
you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

1:22:52.473 --> 1:22:54.492
I should have killed
you in Washington.

1:22:56.080 --> 1:22:57.780
Yeah.

1:22:59.485 --> 1:23:02.192
He only has to evade you
for another few minutes.

1:23:03.254 --> 1:23:06.575
And the last remaining
human outposts will fall.

1:23:08.164 --> 1:23:11.309
We need an intercept path. And
the fastest way to the surface.

1:23:12.383 --> 1:23:14.083
Already done.

1:23:14.553 --> 1:23:21.553
If you release the Antivirus, it will kill
all organisms infected with the T-Virus.

1:23:23.323 --> 1:23:25.919
You know what that
means, don't you?

1:23:26.967 --> 1:23:30.368
- I know.
- Alice. You can't!

1:23:30.864 --> 1:23:33.554
- I don't have a choice.
- There has to be another way.

1:23:37.006 --> 1:23:38.725
You know there isn't.

1:23:38.925 --> 1:23:41.625
4:33 left.
You have to hurry!

1:24:26.927 --> 1:24:28.627
Help me.

1:24:28.909 --> 1:24:30.643
You don't need help, Wesker.

1:24:33.634 --> 1:24:35.334
You're dying.

1:24:36.327 --> 1:24:38.027
Just get on with it.

1:24:40.602 --> 1:24:43.298
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

1:24:44.264 --> 1:24:47.317
Confirm DNA scan and
voice print identification.

1:24:47.352 --> 1:24:52.174
- Identity confirmed.
- Confirm security override 4365.

1:24:52.364 --> 1:24:54.118
Override confirmed.

1:24:54.119 --> 1:24:58.473
You will now take yourself offline and
place all functions under my sole control.

1:24:58.508 --> 1:25:00.898
As you wish.
Shutting down now.

1:25:01.728 --> 1:25:05.441
Dr. Isaacs.
You and the Umbrella High Command.

1:25:05.641 --> 1:25:06.383
Yes?

1:25:07.179 --> 1:25:09.756
You're all going to die down here.

1:25:14.409 --> 1:25:16.996
Your little friend won't
be able to help you now.

1:25:17.031 --> 1:25:18.873
You can't run anymore.

1:25:21.998 --> 1:25:23.698
I wasn't running.

1:29:10.348 --> 1:29:12.048
Is that all you got?

1:29:13.756 --> 1:29:15.456
Because if it is...

1:29:16.462 --> 1:29:18.162
I'm gonna have to kill you.

1:30:06.185 --> 1:30:08.515
We've played a long
game, you and I.

1:30:10.618 --> 1:30:12.318
But now it's over.

1:30:13.131 --> 1:30:15.253
Yes.

1:30:16.661 --> 1:30:18.361
Yes, it is.

1:31:11.265 --> 1:31:12.965
I made you.

1:31:13.313 --> 1:31:15.013
Yeah.

1:31:15.604 --> 1:31:17.304
Big mistake.

1:31:24.526 --> 1:31:26.226
Claire.

1:31:27.582 --> 1:31:29.357
Go. While there's still time.

1:31:30.167 --> 1:31:31.949
Go! I'll be right behind you.

1:32:32.924 --> 1:32:34.624
Your time's up.

1:32:38.026 --> 1:32:39.726
Alice!

1:32:39.870 --> 1:32:42.333
I brought them here!
I brought them for you!

1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:52.810
What the hell are you?

1:32:55.385 --> 1:32:57.106
I'm you, you idiot.

1:33:01.181 --> 1:33:02.881
No.

1:33:03.625 --> 1:33:05.325
No.

1:33:06.199 --> 1:33:07.899
That's not possible.

1:33:08.263 --> 1:33:09.963
The real you.

1:33:11.343 --> 1:33:13.043
No!

1:33:15.583 --> 1:33:17.595
Liar! Abomination!

1:33:17.781 --> 1:33:20.106
Filthy,

1:33:20.479 --> 1:33:22.232
clone!

1:33:32.297 --> 1:33:34.349
I'm me. He's not me.

1:35:21.851 --> 1:35:23.551
You did it. Alice.

1:35:24.051 --> 1:35:25.751
Alice?

1:35:27.455 --> 1:35:29.155
You did it.

1:35:32.149 --> 1:35:33.849
Why am I still alive?

1:35:34.314 --> 1:35:36.014
I don't know.

1:35:41.852 --> 1:35:42.852
- What happened?

1:35:42.830 --> 1:35:43.830
- When Isaacs died,

1:35:42.872 --> 1:35:46.401
I could bring myself back
online and stop the attacks

1:35:45.836 --> 1:35:47.649
on the remaining
human settlements.

1:35:48.193 --> 1:35:50.920
- You saved them.
- Why am I still alive?

1:35:50.955 --> 1:35:54.599
The Antivirus only destroyed
the T-Virus within your body.

1:35:54.634 --> 1:35:58.876
It didn't harm the healthy cells.
You are now free of infection.

1:35:59.875 --> 1:36:03.087
I thought I would die.
You and Alicia...

1:36:03.098 --> 1:36:03.773
You lied to me.

1:36:03.973 --> 1:36:06.719
We had to know if you were
willing to make the sacrifice,

1:36:06.754 --> 1:36:11.643
to give up your life for others. This was
something no one at Umbrella would've done.

1:36:11.678 --> 1:36:16.166
Alicia Marcus was right about you.
You were better than all of them.

1:36:16.201 --> 1:36:18.778
I was one of them. I
was created by Umbrella.

1:36:19.446 --> 1:36:21.594
- Just an instrument for them.
- No.

1:36:21.629 --> 1:36:25.276
You became something more than
they could ever have anticipated.

1:36:25.311 --> 1:36:28.803
The clone became more
human than they ever could be.

1:36:29.887 --> 1:36:32.292
And you have one
more step to make.

1:36:34.458 --> 1:36:36.158
What do you mean?

1:36:41.504 --> 1:36:45.052
Before she died, Alicia
downloaded her memories,

1:36:45.101 --> 1:36:46.830
for you.

1:36:46.831 --> 1:36:49.234
The childhood you never had.

1:36:53.990 --> 1:36:56.744
Combined with the woman
she could never become.

1:37:29.507 --> 1:37:31.539
When the T-Virus
spread across the Earth,

1:37:31.574 --> 1:37:33.843
it did so at the speed
of the modern world.

1:37:33.878 --> 1:37:36.327
Carried by jetliners
across the globe.

1:37:37.950 --> 1:37:40.776
The antivirus is airborne,
spread by the winds.

1:37:41.731 --> 1:37:44.870
It could take years for it to
reach every corner of the Earth.

1:37:45.749 --> 1:37:47.987
Until then, my
work is not done.

1:37:54.906 --> 1:37:56.919
My name is Alice.
