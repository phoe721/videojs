"Despicable Me 3 (2017)" ^ (Run time  01:22:25)

01:02.557 --> 01:06.005
Starring young Balthazar Bratt
as a child prodigy

01:06.030 --> 01:10.633
and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.

01:10.658 --> 01:12.639
There he is!
Get him!

01:15.488 --> 01:18.709
I've been a bad boy!

01:18.734 --> 01:21.607
Bratt was the biggest child actor
of the 1980s,

01:21.632 --> 01:24.964
striking a chord with audiences
all over the world.

01:24.989 --> 01:26.220
- Yay!
- Yeah!

01:26.397 --> 01:27.546
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

01:27.571 --> 01:28.809
There he is!
Get him!

01:28.834 --> 01:31.632
But it all came to an end
in season three,

01:31.657 --> 01:32.658
When...

01:32.683 --> 01:35.212
I've been a bad boy!

01:35.237 --> 01:38.714
- The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.
- Boy? Boy?

01:39.137 --> 01:41.934
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

01:41.959 --> 01:45.373
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral.

01:45.398 --> 01:50.589
Starting to actually believed he was
the character he played on TV.

01:50.614 --> 01:52.560
What are you looking at?

01:52.585 --> 01:54.461
Leading us all to wonder...

01:54.486 --> 01:56.777
Where is he now?

02:03.112 --> 02:04.429
You know what, Clive?

02:04.454 --> 02:06.953
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

02:06.978 --> 02:10.458
but being one in real life
is even better.

02:10.483 --> 02:11.864
Heist music!

02:11.889 --> 02:13.717
Here it comes.

02:15.854 --> 02:17.601
Ow! What?
Clive!

02:17.626 --> 02:20.444
What are you doing?
How is that heist music?

02:20.469 --> 02:22.503
Sorry, my bad.

02:55.866 --> 02:56.757
Ewww!

02:56.782 --> 02:58.949
Wha-whoa!
Gah!

03:01.700 --> 03:03.631
Mommy!

03:04.187 --> 03:05.535
Stop him!

03:08.045 --> 03:11.527
Sir, the ship has been boarded by
some kind of... monster.

03:11.552 --> 03:13.412
Wait, that's not a monster.

03:13.437 --> 03:16.330
That's a man
wearing shoulder pads.

03:16.355 --> 03:20.226
There's only one supervillain whose
fashion sense is quite that dated

03:20.251 --> 03:22.213
Balthazar Bratt.

03:22.238 --> 03:24.941
Blast it!
The Dupont Diamond is on that ship!

03:24.966 --> 03:29.384
I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately.

03:30.791 --> 03:33.336
Ha, ha, ha... !

03:33.376 --> 03:34.358
Woo-hoo!

03:34.383 --> 03:37.200
We're already here!
Agents Grucy are closing in fast.

03:37.225 --> 03:39.917
Yes... wait, wha?
What did you call us?

03:39.942 --> 03:42.855
Grucy. You know,
Gru and Lucy mushed together.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.903
Try it.

03:43.928 --> 03:46.334
Haha!
I like it, but not a lot,

03:46.359 --> 03:47.975
I don't like it.

03:52.759 --> 03:53.774
Stop!

03:53.799 --> 03:55.150
On the ground!

04:16.048 --> 04:17.804
The jewel!
Move!

04:17.829 --> 04:19.432
Go, go, go!

04:24.360 --> 04:25.655
Uh?

04:33.660 --> 04:37.939
Too late again, Gru.
Ha, ha, ha... !

04:44.057 --> 04:46.221
WHAAA... ?

04:46.246 --> 04:47.259
He's getting away!!

04:47.284 --> 04:49.109
That's what he thinks.

04:52.182 --> 04:55.054
- Wahooo!
- Ha, ha!

04:55.079 --> 04:56.855
Go, go!

04:57.374 --> 04:59.080
Ugh!
Go, go.

04:59.105 --> 05:01.004
Go, go, go!

05:04.087 --> 05:05.908
I don't think
we can make it, Gru.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.620
We can make it!

05:09.337 --> 05:13.900
We can make it... !

05:13.925 --> 05:16.641
No, we can't!

05:17.135 --> 05:19.340
Get ready!

05:19.896 --> 05:24.004
Get ready for whaaa... !

05:32.551 --> 05:34.884
Hey.
How're you doing?

05:37.378 --> 05:38.617
Are you okay?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.657
- Hello.
- Oh.

05:40.682 --> 05:42.578
You guys are so cute.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.518
Go get him, Gru Gru!

05:44.884 --> 05:46.722
Hello, Gru.

05:47.428 --> 05:48.928
How's your transition coming?

05:48.953 --> 05:52.636
You know, from world's worst villain
to world's worst agent?

05:52.661 --> 05:55.051
Oh, that's hilarious!
You should be on TV!

05:55.076 --> 05:57.104
Oh, that's right,
you were...

05:57.129 --> 05:59.174
but then you got canceled.

05:59.588 --> 06:01.104
Ha ha!

06:01.326 --> 06:02.791
What about that?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.997
What?
Oh! Girls… !

06:05.022 --> 06:06.026
Oh!

06:08.129 --> 06:09.614
Dance fight!

06:22.374 --> 06:23.761
Ow!

06:27.669 --> 06:29.881
Alpha team, the diamond is secure.

06:29.906 --> 06:31.644
Come and pick up the package.

06:31.669 --> 06:34.157
Copy that, Alpha team on approach.

06:39.541 --> 06:40.945
Gru.

06:40.970 --> 06:43.308
- Did you actually think
I was unconscious?
- Oh.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.437
It's called acting, hoser!

06:45.462 --> 06:48.335
And clearly I've still got it!

07:02.857 --> 07:07.193
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

07:07.218 --> 07:08.421
Freeze!
Don't move!

07:08.446 --> 07:09.818
Son of a Betamax!

07:09.843 --> 07:11.354
Go! Go!
Get him! Get him!

07:11.379 --> 07:13.186
He's getting away!

07:14.239 --> 07:16.686
This isn't over, Gru!
You hear me?

07:16.711 --> 07:18.740
This is not over!

07:18.765 --> 07:22.217
Yeah?
Well, I still have the diamond!

07:22.242 --> 07:27.975
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to...

07:28.000 --> 07:33.496
Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.

07:33.521 --> 07:38.051
Happy birthday to you.

07:38.076 --> 07:41.111
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

07:41.246 --> 07:43.548
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah!

07:43.573 --> 07:47.436
Party!
Party, everyone!

07:52.478 --> 07:56.743
DESPICABLE ME 3

08:00.475 --> 08:02.453
Hey!
Watch it!

08:08.490 --> 08:11.449
I can't believe
Bratt got away, again.

08:11.474 --> 08:14.316
How is this possible?
How...

08:21.599 --> 08:25.376
And it's not just that he got away!
It's that he's so smug about it!

08:25.401 --> 08:29.061
Ewww.
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!

08:29.086 --> 08:30.648
Edna, hey.

08:30.673 --> 08:32.459
Looking hot... today.

08:32.484 --> 08:34.404
Got the... cats on you.

08:34.436 --> 08:36.632
And it was just so humiliating.

08:36.657 --> 08:39.830
Dangling there in the
bubble-gum Speedo.

08:39.855 --> 08:42.233
And I didn't have time to go
to the gym this week!

08:42.258 --> 08:44.821
And I had a big breakfast!

08:44.846 --> 08:47.686
I was feeling a little bloated!

08:49.355 --> 08:51.560
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.

08:51.585 --> 08:56.001
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

08:56.026 --> 08:57.545
And another thing!

08:57.570 --> 09:02.856
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

09:07.060 --> 09:10.778
Thank you all for coming
in such short notice.

09:10.803 --> 09:15.923
It is with great sadness that
I inform you that as of today

09:15.948 --> 09:20.147
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

09:21.599 --> 09:23.169
Oh no.

09:23.194 --> 09:30.986
Your new leader is coming directly from
head office, effective immediately.

09:31.011 --> 09:38.932
She is the very gifted, very ambitious
Miss Valerie Da Vinci.

09:38.957 --> 09:44.798
As I look out over all of your faces,
I am flooded with so many memories.

09:44.823 --> 09:48.071
- Oh boy, this is a snoozeday.
- I... Excuse me.

09:48.096 --> 09:52.130
Blah blah blah. We understand.
You're old, you're fat, you're done.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.258
Let me breathe in.

09:55.604 --> 09:58.036
Woo.
Broke a little sweat there.

09:58.741 --> 10:01.080
First order of business.

10:01.105 --> 10:04.335
Which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?!

10:05.224 --> 10:07.511
Uh… that would be me.

10:07.536 --> 10:11.929
Although I don't know
if I'd say 'loser' per Se,

10:11.954 --> 10:13.751
kind of a...
Huh!

10:15.472 --> 10:19.010
Oh, it's the girls.
Not a good time.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.502
- Hey!
- Aaah!

10:20.527 --> 10:23.483
Yes, sir.
Huh, uh... ma'am.

10:23.508 --> 10:24.874
You're making me nervous.

10:24.899 --> 10:27.916
How could you let Balthazar Bratt,

10:27.941 --> 10:31.617
the AVL's most-wanted villain,
just get away?

10:31.642 --> 10:33.929
That is the opposite of
what we do here!

10:33.954 --> 10:38.122
Okay, okay, yes,
maybe he got away... again,

10:38.147 --> 10:40.922
but he didn't get the diamond!

10:40.947 --> 10:44.038
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

10:44.063 --> 10:46.269
This close!

10:46.299 --> 10:48.074
Huh?
Interesting.

10:48.099 --> 10:49.408
You're fired!

10:49.433 --> 10:50.589
Huh!
What?

10:50.614 --> 10:53.475
This is totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.880
You know what?
If you fire him,

10:54.905 --> 10:57.318
you're going to have to fire me,
sister sister.

10:57.343 --> 11:01.049
And do you really want to do that?
Do ya?

11:01.074 --> 11:02.940
No, no, no, no, no.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.962
Well, I guess she did!

11:16.518 --> 11:18.288
Honey, you didn't have to do that.

11:18.313 --> 11:20.075
I know how much
you love your job.

11:20.100 --> 11:23.238
Well, I love other things more.

11:25.229 --> 11:27.664
You know, we're going to
have to tell the girls.

11:27.689 --> 11:29.457
Can you do it?

11:29.482 --> 11:32.288
The whole Mom thing is
still kind of new to me.

11:32.313 --> 11:34.106
Oh, sure.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.423
Hello?

12:00.533 --> 12:02.792
- Aloha!
- Aloha!

12:02.998 --> 12:04.357
Oh!

12:04.820 --> 12:07.233
This is unexpected.

12:07.258 --> 12:09.722
Well, you never got to go
on a honeymoon, so…

12:09.747 --> 12:11.007
We made you dinner!

12:11.032 --> 12:12.175
It's a luau!

12:12.200 --> 12:14.981
We got pineapples and
coconuts and lukuleles!

12:15.006 --> 12:17.308
- Oh ho, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:17.333 --> 12:21.212
Hey!
Ya malatika tika, hee ha!

12:21.237 --> 12:23.226
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

12:23.251 --> 12:25.623
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

12:30.560 --> 12:31.559
Ahem.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.249
The soup of the day,
madame and monsieur.

12:35.274 --> 12:37.817
The gummy bears were my idea.

12:41.645 --> 12:45.039
Mmmmmm…
Looks too good to even eat!

12:45.064 --> 12:46.680
Am I right?

12:47.121 --> 12:50.319
- But I made it for you.…
- Oh.

12:53.596 --> 13:00.961
Good soup! I love the combination
of gummy bears and meat!

13:06.340 --> 13:08.004
I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth,

13:08.029 --> 13:09.989
because it's so good
I don't want to swallow it.

13:10.014 --> 13:11.673
So.
How was work?

13:11.698 --> 13:15.032
Did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

13:15.057 --> 13:19.733
Well, actually,
today Lucy and I

13:19.758 --> 13:24.835
were invited to not work
at the AVL anymore.

13:25.015 --> 13:27.072
Huh!
No!

13:28.900 --> 13:30.052
You got fired?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.941
Oh no!
No, no, no...

13:34.102 --> 13:35.671
- Yes.
- What?

13:35.696 --> 13:37.650
But don't worry,

13:37.675 --> 13:40.334
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs real soon.

13:40.359 --> 13:42.602
Even better ones.

13:42.627 --> 13:46.203
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

13:46.977 --> 13:49.508
Oh, I know!
You could gamble online!

13:49.533 --> 13:51.583
That's what Katie's dad does!

13:51.608 --> 13:54.473
Okay, we will definitely
look into that.

13:54.498 --> 13:56.347
That's a good suggestion.

13:56.372 --> 14:00.711
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

14:02.215 --> 14:03.296
Hmm.

14:06.944 --> 14:09.545
Guys, shhhhhh.
I don't think you heard me right.

14:09.570 --> 14:13.221
No, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean
that we are going back to being villains.

14:13.246 --> 14:15.007
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:15.032 --> 14:16.489
Boring!
Anything, please!

14:16.514 --> 14:18.641
Okay, alright,
I get it.

14:18.666 --> 14:21.247
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately,

14:21.272 --> 14:27.188
especially with Doctor Nefario
accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,

14:29.098 --> 14:29.695
Ow!

14:29.720 --> 14:33.504
but our life of crime is over!

14:34.319 --> 14:37.861
Mel.
Mel, you're with me on this, right?

14:38.271 --> 14:39.573
Look.

14:39.598 --> 14:41.216
- Good...
- Yay!

14:41.241 --> 14:43.196
- Boring!
- Boo!

14:43.221 --> 14:44.895
- Good...
- Yay!

14:44.920 --> 14:47.071
- Boring!
- Ohh!

14:47.096 --> 14:48.906
- Good...
- Yay!

14:48.931 --> 14:51.630
- Boring!
- Boo!

14:51.655 --> 14:54.178
Minions… no more boring!!

14:54.203 --> 14:56.600
Boring!
Boring!

14:56.625 --> 14:59.620
Guys!
Listen to me and read my lips!

14:59.645 --> 15:04.131
Lissa me lippo, pomodoro la comquit!

15:06.344 --> 15:09.848
What?
What did I say?

15:11.141 --> 15:14.112
Oh, okay,
pomodoro la kumquat.

15:14.137 --> 15:16.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say no more crime?

15:16.453 --> 15:17.289
I cannot accept this.

15:17.314 --> 15:18.925
Don't take that tone with me!

15:18.950 --> 15:20.991
We're not going back to villainy.

15:21.016 --> 15:22.336
Uh.
No villainy?

15:22.361 --> 15:26.085
Yes. And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

15:29.282 --> 15:31.884
Look, if you guys
don't stop that right now,

15:31.909 --> 15:33.813
there will be consequences!

15:33.838 --> 15:35.880
Huh!
I can do whatever I want.

15:35.905 --> 15:36.345
Hey.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.521
Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.372
Oh. Listen to this.
I quit!

15:41.611 --> 15:43.095
Bye to you!

15:43.120 --> 15:45.250
What?
You quit?

15:45.649 --> 15:48.266
You're serious?
Come on.

15:51.129 --> 15:53.384
Uh. Uh.
Bud-Buddy?

15:53.409 --> 15:55.725
Dave!
Jerry!

15:56.525 --> 15:59.780
Great news, guys...
you've been promoted.

15:59.805 --> 16:03.670
You're in charge now, eh?
Not bad!

16:04.754 --> 16:07.664
Yipa! Yipo!
Yippee!

16:07.689 --> 16:11.201
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!

16:11.892 --> 16:13.529
Jeesh.

16:25.925 --> 16:27.131
Huh!

16:32.985 --> 16:35.329
Monsieur Pompo.

16:35.554 --> 16:41.105
To what do we owe the presence
of the world's foremost gem expert?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.097
The chief of police sent me.

16:43.122 --> 16:46.062
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

16:46.087 --> 16:50.234
The Dupont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

17:05.008 --> 17:06.506
Ooh la la.

17:06.531 --> 17:09.286
You have been duped.

17:09.311 --> 17:10.777
What?
We have?

17:10.802 --> 17:11.975
Yes.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.792
By me!

17:17.406 --> 17:18.836
Wha-What is... ?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.780
Oh no.
Help!

17:28.822 --> 17:31.068
Ha ha ha...

17:42.028 --> 17:44.887
I've been a bad boy!

17:44.912 --> 17:49.326
Or should I say,
"Je suis un mauvais garçon!"

18:03.399 --> 18:04.751
Oh.

18:27.636 --> 18:30.721
Hey, Gru,
whatcha doing down here?

18:30.746 --> 18:32.483
In the dark.

18:32.508 --> 18:33.428
Alone.

18:33.453 --> 18:36.271
Oh nothing, just thinking.

18:36.296 --> 18:37.741
You okay?

18:37.766 --> 18:40.418
Oh yes, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

18:40.443 --> 18:42.186
It's just…

18:42.603 --> 18:48.088
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like a… failure.

18:48.477 --> 18:50.773
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

18:50.798 --> 18:54.303
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

18:54.328 --> 18:57.658
If only I could've nailed Bratt.

18:57.872 --> 19:01.259
So many times
I almost had him!

19:01.284 --> 19:03.824
But now I'll never
get the chance.

19:03.849 --> 19:05.948
'Cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

19:05.973 --> 19:09.613
Gru, you've got to let this go.
It's time to look forward.

19:09.638 --> 19:12.286
Things will get better, I promise.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.842
Come this way.
Come this way.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.882
Coming through, make way.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.680
- Coming through.
- Uh, excuse me.

19:35.939 --> 19:39.524
Pardon me,
young... people.

19:39.549 --> 19:42.915
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

19:42.940 --> 19:44.711
Uh.
Uh, ah.

19:44.736 --> 19:46.210
You are looking for Minions?

19:46.235 --> 19:48.603
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

19:48.628 --> 19:50.857
Gru is a lousy boss!

19:51.319 --> 19:53.279
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:53.304 --> 19:54.702
Bye!

20:01.576 --> 20:03.295
Idiots.

20:06.517 --> 20:08.690
No. Kyle.
Stop!

20:08.715 --> 20:10.753
Kyle, let go.

20:13.135 --> 20:14.385
BRATT STEALS WORLD'S
BIGGEST DIAMOND!

20:14.410 --> 20:17.583
No, no...
you've got to be kidding me.

20:17.608 --> 20:18.762
Lucy, did you see...

20:18.787 --> 20:22.639
He helps you if you have nightmares,
and he's really good to snuggle with...

20:22.664 --> 20:24.382
Oh no, no, no, Agnes!
Agnes!

20:24.407 --> 20:26.596
So, take good care of him.

20:26.621 --> 20:28.322
Thank you!

20:28.347 --> 20:30.990
Agnes, what are you doing?
You...

20:31.015 --> 20:32.870
You sold your unicorn?

20:32.895 --> 20:37.027
Well, I just wanted to help.
Since you don't have a job.

20:37.409 --> 20:39.806
I got two whole dollars for it!

20:39.831 --> 20:41.745
- Awwwww.
- Awwwww.

20:42.537 --> 20:44.283
Uh, excuse me.

20:44.308 --> 20:46.418
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

20:46.443 --> 20:48.099
Yes, but this will only take a....

20:48.124 --> 20:50.466
Hey, Eyebrows.
Get off the lawn.

20:50.491 --> 20:51.842
Yeah, but...

20:51.867 --> 20:55.243
- Hey, could you...
- Oh uh, of course.

20:55.268 --> 20:57.642
Now, as I was saying.
I...

20:57.667 --> 21:00.293
- Uh... Oh.
- Goodbye.

21:05.773 --> 21:08.299
Listen, Agnes.
You don't need to worry.

21:08.324 --> 21:10.125
We're going to be fine.

21:10.150 --> 21:12.403
- For real?
- For real.

21:12.428 --> 21:14.226
Now come on,
let's pack this stuff up.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.471
Ow.
Ow.

21:15.496 --> 21:18.993
Seriously?
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

21:19.018 --> 21:21.751
Excuse me, Mr. Gru.

21:21.776 --> 21:25.111
But I really must
have a word with you.

21:25.136 --> 21:26.701
How did you know my name?

21:26.726 --> 21:31.153
Allow me to introduce myself...
my name is Fritz, and OW!

21:31.178 --> 21:33.424
Uh, good puppy.

21:33.465 --> 21:37.968
And I am inquiring…
on behalf of your twin brother, Dru.

21:37.993 --> 21:39.495
He needs your help.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.263
What?
Twin brother?

21:41.288 --> 21:42.354
Twin brother?

21:42.379 --> 21:43.395
- Twin brother?
- Twin brother?

21:43.420 --> 21:44.313
Oh Yeah.

21:44.338 --> 21:47.793
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

21:47.818 --> 21:51.698
Your father has recently
passed away and...

21:51.723 --> 21:54.614
Okay, cuckoo.
I'm sorry, but my dad died

21:54.639 --> 21:57.274
when I was a baby,
and I don't have any brother.

21:57.299 --> 21:58.633
You've got the wrong guy.

21:58.658 --> 21:59.841
Really?

21:59.866 --> 22:03.988
Well, then how do
you explain... this?

22:10.077 --> 22:13.127
Ahhhhh!
Bellissimo!

22:15.046 --> 22:18.082
- Oh, hello, Gru.
- Hi, Mom.

22:18.107 --> 22:22.455
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

22:23.460 --> 22:26.811
There you are, you cute cute.

22:29.448 --> 22:35.833
These are my diving instructors,
Vincenzo and Paolo!

22:36.571 --> 22:38.710
Ciao, boys!

22:38.897 --> 22:41.029
So what do you want?

22:41.054 --> 22:44.473
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

22:45.024 --> 22:47.071
How did you find out?
Who told you?

22:47.096 --> 22:48.542
Wait, what?
It's true?

22:48.567 --> 22:50.656
You never told me
I had a brother!

22:50.681 --> 22:54.209
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born!

22:54.234 --> 22:57.774
Yeah, yeah, that was the agreement.

22:57.799 --> 23:01.275
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

23:03.639 --> 23:09.204
Shortly after you and your brother
were born, your father and I divorced.

23:09.229 --> 23:12.549
We each took one son
to raise on our own.

23:12.574 --> 23:16.472
And promised never
to see each other again.

23:17.547 --> 23:22.454
Obviously, I got second pick.

23:24.498 --> 23:26.863
I have a brother.

23:33.476 --> 23:36.285
Hey girls, how are things
in row B, huh?

23:36.310 --> 23:38.855
I've put together some
fun activities for the trip.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.860
Who is up for some
Gin Rummy?

23:41.885 --> 23:45.746
Yeah. Umm...
We're good.

23:45.771 --> 23:47.646
Oh.
Okay.

23:47.671 --> 23:50.308
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.032
I hope I win.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.795
I wonder what Dru
will be like!

23:54.820 --> 23:55.265
Woo!

23:55.290 --> 23:57.059
Maybe we'll have that twin thing

23:57.084 --> 24:00.130
where we can read
each other's minds, you know?

24:00.155 --> 24:03.917
- How cool would that be?!
- Um, super cool.

24:10.839 --> 24:13.653
Ah, ha ha ha...

24:13.678 --> 24:15.427
Ooh.

24:17.369 --> 24:19.354
Aah!
Ow! Ow!

24:19.379 --> 24:20.894
Woo-hoo!

24:20.919 --> 24:25.178
Freedonia!
Freedonia!

24:25.493 --> 24:27.339
Hi, piggy, piggy!

24:27.364 --> 24:30.801
Huh!
Whoa, look at that house!

24:30.826 --> 24:32.451
It's like a castle!

24:32.476 --> 24:36.491
I can't wait
to meet my brother!

24:36.516 --> 24:38.698
Uh.
What's with all the pigs?

24:38.723 --> 24:41.058
This is the family business.

24:41.083 --> 24:44.964
The largest pig farm
in the whole of Freedonia.

24:45.449 --> 24:47.759
Okay, nice pig.

24:48.171 --> 24:51.008
No!
That's my private part!

24:51.082 --> 24:53.335
Owww!

24:53.360 --> 24:55.875
This pig has issues!

24:56.265 --> 24:57.725
Please, come in.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.979
Wow.
Yeah, haha!

25:06.082 --> 25:07.709
Whoa!

25:07.734 --> 25:10.695
Oh, this is amazing!

25:10.720 --> 25:14.892
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel.
But with pigs.

25:18.817 --> 25:26.607
My brother!!

25:26.632 --> 25:28.351
- My brother!
- My brother!

25:28.376 --> 25:29.610
Gru!

25:29.635 --> 25:31.356
Dru!

25:37.600 --> 25:43.133
Ahhhh!
Brother! I am hugging you!

25:43.158 --> 25:45.055
I'm so happy!

25:45.345 --> 25:49.740
After all these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

25:49.765 --> 25:53.713
- Yup, alright, good.
- Oh, look at that!

25:53.738 --> 25:55.943
- Woo!
- You must be the beautiful wife!

25:55.968 --> 25:59.124
Beautiful, oh.
Stop it!

25:59.149 --> 25:59.930
Sweet talker.

25:59.955 --> 26:03.850
How is my brother finding a wife
like you when he is so bald?

26:06.913 --> 26:11.150
Woo-hoo!
These must be my nieces!

26:11.175 --> 26:14.947
Huh! You're Agnes,
you're small with big eyes!

26:14.972 --> 26:17.191
And it makes me want to
put you in my pocket!

26:17.216 --> 26:20.507
You can't do that.
I'm too big.

26:20.532 --> 26:22.090
And Edith,

26:22.115 --> 26:25.580
I can tell that you are
a little mischievous.

26:25.605 --> 26:28.221
We're going to have to make
a little trouble later.

26:28.246 --> 26:29.946
Wha...
I already have!

26:29.971 --> 26:31.647
Ow.
Ow! Ow!

26:31.672 --> 26:34.315
Please, stop.
Why are you doing that?

26:34.340 --> 26:35.706
Ow!
Ow.

26:35.731 --> 26:39.182
Fist bump for mischievous behavior.

26:39.207 --> 26:42.209
And Margo!
Oh, you are so mature.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.049
I'm guessing what… fifteen?

26:45.081 --> 26:46.284
Fifteen?

26:46.309 --> 26:49.927
She's twelve! She looks twelve.
And will always be twelve.

26:49.952 --> 26:53.039
So, Dru…
this place is amazing.

26:53.064 --> 26:56.807
I mean, you just walk through the doors
and you're like: wooooowwwooowwooooo!!

26:56.832 --> 27:02.259
Eh. It's nice, I guess, sure.
I'm not really into 'things.'

27:04.924 --> 27:07.017
Wow!
This is so cool!

27:07.042 --> 27:09.382
Oh my gosh,
he's even got a helicopter!

27:09.407 --> 27:11.394
This is the best!

27:11.539 --> 27:13.840
Yes, the best.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.220
- All right, let's go home now.
- Home? Why?

27:16.245 --> 27:19.895
I don't know, this guy,
with the mansion and the cars

27:19.920 --> 27:24.672
and… all the hair,
silky-smooth, luxurious hair.

27:24.697 --> 27:27.062
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

27:27.087 --> 27:29.866
Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.
Give him a chance.

27:29.891 --> 27:33.462
Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I
catch up on some brother stuff,

27:33.487 --> 27:36.165
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you.

27:36.190 --> 27:37.422
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Awesome.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.727
I love surprises!

27:38.752 --> 27:40.959
Oh, this is perfect.
Mother, daughter bonding time.

27:40.984 --> 27:43.181
Let's do it.
Woo-woo!

27:43.323 --> 27:45.660
Bye!
You boys have fun.

27:45.685 --> 27:48.720
Ha ha ha!
Whoopee!

27:51.249 --> 27:53.630
Now you can be as evil
as Balthazar Bratt

27:53.655 --> 27:56.110
with the evil Bratt action figure,

27:56.135 --> 27:59.858
featuring music activated
Break Dance mode.

27:59.883 --> 28:04.055
Also featuring bubble gum
launching shoulder pads.

28:04.182 --> 28:08.022
And the all new
Mega Diamond Laser.

28:09.741 --> 28:11.399
No more math!

28:11.424 --> 28:14.217
I've been a bad boy!

28:15.010 --> 28:18.087
Mega Diamond Laser does not
actually incinerate books.

28:18.939 --> 28:24.064
How could Hollywood cancel a show
that produced toys like this, Clive?

28:24.387 --> 28:26.784
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece.

28:26.809 --> 28:29.394
Does no one value
true art anymore?

28:29.419 --> 28:31.567
It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.

28:31.592 --> 28:35.533
Well, now that I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.

28:35.558 --> 28:39.444
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.

28:39.469 --> 28:41.986
Oh, wait! No, it's not!
I hate that tweeb!

28:42.011 --> 28:43.915
And you, Hollywood!

28:43.940 --> 28:47.149
This time, I'm canceling you!

28:47.174 --> 28:50.605
And all the losers
who rejected me!

28:50.630 --> 28:52.972
Ha ha ha... !

28:55.724 --> 28:57.440
Ooooo, piggy, piggy!

28:57.465 --> 29:00.976
So how are things
going for you, career-wise?

29:01.001 --> 29:02.803
Ahhaaaaa… great.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.809
So, so great.
Crushing it.

29:05.834 --> 29:12.234
Well, I've got something that I think
you will find very interesting.

29:13.773 --> 29:16.223
Hold on to your face, Brother.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.331
Whaaaaaaaaaa!

29:22.356 --> 29:24.978
Yee-haw!
Ya ya!

29:25.003 --> 29:26.439
Eh.
What?

29:26.971 --> 29:28.234
Yee-haw!

29:33.897 --> 29:35.272
Ow!

29:36.574 --> 29:38.875
Huh? Ah!
Salami!

29:39.569 --> 29:41.213
Hey, I got Salami.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.075
Ah, yes, yes.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.590
It's Salami.

29:44.943 --> 29:48.040
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Come on, come on.

29:50.008 --> 29:52.160
What is all this?

29:52.185 --> 29:56.929
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

29:58.872 --> 30:00.246
Haha!
Hey.

30:00.271 --> 30:02.168
It's Gru with boobs!

30:03.202 --> 30:07.212
Now, feast your eyes on…

30:07.237 --> 30:12.609
Dad's lair!
Ta-da!

30:12.634 --> 30:18.249
Whoa whoa whoa, wait…
So our dad was a villain?

30:18.274 --> 30:20.561
No, no, no.
Not just a villain.

30:20.586 --> 30:24.148
But one of the greatest
of all time!

30:24.173 --> 30:28.416
He was known
as the Bald terror.

30:28.441 --> 30:31.625
That's him?
Our dad?

30:31.650 --> 30:35.757
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.276
He was?

30:37.301 --> 30:40.623
But me…
not so much

30:40.648 --> 30:46.148
To Dad, I was just a failure.

30:46.282 --> 30:49.250
He never thought I had
what it took to be a villain.

30:49.275 --> 30:53.118
But now you can help me
prove him wrong.

30:53.143 --> 30:57.934
Brother, teach me the art of villainy!

30:59.415 --> 31:02.649
No. No, no, no.
I can't do that.

31:02.674 --> 31:07.617
What? But it's our family tradition!
You can't say no to that!

31:07.642 --> 31:11.169
Look, I'm sorry.
I've left that life behind me.

31:11.194 --> 31:13.667
- End of story.
- Oh.

31:14.507 --> 31:16.973
Okay.
I understand.

31:16.998 --> 31:19.725
Hmmm…
I wonder what this does?

31:20.283 --> 31:21.188
Huh?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.345
Help.
Help!

31:22.370 --> 31:23.514
No no no...

31:23.546 --> 31:26.368
- Aaah!
- Aah!

31:36.150 --> 31:37.520
Holey moley!

31:37.544 --> 31:42.496
Dad's villain wheels.
Pretty slick, huh?

31:42.521 --> 31:44.920
Hey, you want to
take her out for a spin?

31:44.945 --> 31:47.027
Just for some fun?

31:47.948 --> 31:50.191
Hmmmmm…

31:50.723 --> 31:54.252
Woo-hoo!

31:55.139 --> 31:56.885
Look out!
Whoa! Whoa!

31:56.910 --> 31:59.336
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

32:00.260 --> 32:02.153
What a beautiful day!

32:02.178 --> 32:06.629
Zero to 400 in 3 seconds.
Able to withstand a nuclear blast,

32:06.654 --> 32:08.837
armed to the teeth!

32:10.186 --> 32:12.514
Oh yeah.
That's pretty nice.

32:12.548 --> 32:16.146
- And it's a hybrid.
- LOOK OUT!

32:36.958 --> 32:40.151
Dad, help me!

32:41.943 --> 32:46.182
I am not enjoying this!

32:54.819 --> 32:57.012
Whoa.
What is going on here?

32:57.037 --> 33:00.956
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival!

33:00.981 --> 33:02.157
Go!

33:06.599 --> 33:10.311
Ooo. Look. Look.
Look at all the candies.

33:10.627 --> 33:12.253
Whoa!

33:13.044 --> 33:15.719
Lucy, can we get these please?

33:15.744 --> 33:18.386
Okay, but only one each.
I mean it.

33:18.411 --> 33:20.455
- Awww.
- Oh, man.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.838
No, I don't!
Get as many as you want,

33:22.863 --> 33:24.307
- I don't care!
- Yay!

33:24.332 --> 33:25.382
Awesome!

33:25.407 --> 33:27.544
- Um.
- What?

33:27.569 --> 33:30.925
It's okay to tell them no
sometimes, too, you know.

33:30.950 --> 33:32.560
Moms need to be tough.

33:32.585 --> 33:34.437
Right. Right, tough.
Good one.

33:34.462 --> 33:38.090
I can totally do that. You know,
still figuring out this mom thing.

33:38.115 --> 33:40.608
Getting my sea legs, matie!

33:40.961 --> 33:43.306
It's a unicorn!

33:47.341 --> 33:50.726
Can we go in there!
Please please please please please?

33:52.859 --> 33:55.090
Um, sure…
Yeah.

33:55.115 --> 33:58.453
But first, let's, um…
ooh, look!

33:58.478 --> 34:03.059
It's a traditional Freedonian dance!
How amazing does that look?

34:05.291 --> 34:07.834
Chee!
I love this.

34:08.390 --> 34:11.427
The little girls go and get
the cheese from the little boys.

34:11.452 --> 34:13.315
That's adorable.

34:15.419 --> 34:17.758
Oh, look at that
poor little guy.

34:17.783 --> 34:21.400
With his little boots.
Nobody picked him.

34:21.955 --> 34:24.085
Margo, why don't you go up there?

34:24.110 --> 34:26.334
- No way!
- Okay.

34:26.601 --> 34:28.798
Wait a minute.
No.

34:28.823 --> 34:31.399
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

34:31.424 --> 34:32.729
Right now.

34:32.754 --> 34:33.561
What?

34:33.586 --> 34:35.696
I'm being tougher.
You know, like you said.

34:35.721 --> 34:38.769
No. I meant be tougher
on them, not me.

34:38.794 --> 34:42.248
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst that could happen?

34:44.869 --> 34:46.424
Fine.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.027
Huh!

34:50.464 --> 34:52.591
Wow!

34:53.042 --> 34:55.429
Hey there, I'm Margo.

34:55.454 --> 34:57.274
Hello, Margo.

34:57.300 --> 35:01.720
I am Niko.
Would you like some of my cheese?

35:02.854 --> 35:04.018
Hmmm...

35:04.042 --> 35:07.977
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, Margo! Thank you!

35:09.257 --> 35:11.518
BAM!
I am a great mother.

35:11.549 --> 35:14.909
Did you see that, girls?
I lay down the...

35:15.131 --> 35:17.711
Oh no…
Where are they?

35:17.946 --> 35:20.462
Agnes!
Edith!

35:22.963 --> 35:24.341
Hello.

35:26.457 --> 35:30.028
Uh, look!
A unicorn horn!

35:31.999 --> 35:34.764
My little brain
is going to explode!

35:34.789 --> 35:37.631
Ugh, Agnes.
That's a fake.

35:37.656 --> 35:41.126
Ohhhh, it's real alright.

35:41.298 --> 35:44.861
That horn
came from the Crooked Forest.

35:44.886 --> 35:50.227
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

35:56.610 --> 35:58.574
Laugh!
Laugh, all of you!

35:59.302 --> 36:01.223
They all think I'm crazy.

36:01.248 --> 36:04.643
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

36:04.668 --> 36:06.585
With my own eye!

36:06.610 --> 36:10.044
Wait, wait, wait…
You saw a for-real, live unicorn?

36:10.069 --> 36:11.492
What did it look like?

36:11.517 --> 36:13.611
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

36:13.636 --> 36:16.676
Was it… fluffy?

36:16.701 --> 36:21.747
It was so fluffy
I thought I was going to die.

36:22.059 --> 36:24.550
Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

36:24.794 --> 36:29.667
They say if a maiden pure of heart
goes into the Crooked Forest,

36:29.692 --> 36:35.862
the unicorn will come…
and be hers forever.

36:42.174 --> 36:43.757
Agnes!

36:49.157 --> 36:50.568
Goal!

36:51.019 --> 36:52.468
Excuse me!

36:52.966 --> 36:55.166
Girls!
Don't worry, I'm here!

36:55.191 --> 36:56.776
Are you okay?

36:56.992 --> 37:00.195
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you?

37:00.220 --> 37:06.560
Unicorns are really real!
And I'm gonna find one!!

37:06.585 --> 37:09.204
Sorry, I went a little
mama bear on you.

37:09.229 --> 37:11.152
You know, I heard a scream and…

37:11.177 --> 37:13.045
yeah, okay.
Have a good one!

37:17.446 --> 37:19.501
- Wait for me here!
- Don't.

37:19.526 --> 37:22.622
Stop that! Ow!
You kicked me.

37:24.027 --> 37:26.700
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

37:27.141 --> 37:28.989
Did you just steal candies?

37:29.014 --> 37:29.666
Yes!

37:29.691 --> 37:32.761
That was a lot of
effort for two lollipops.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.177
Oh no!
The police!

37:39.202 --> 37:41.248
What do we do?
What do we do?

37:41.273 --> 37:44.607
Come on!
This is going to be fun!

37:53.760 --> 37:57.030
The police are going to get us!
I'm freaking out!

37:57.055 --> 37:58.543
Brakes!

38:00.889 --> 38:02.397
Cops!

38:17.806 --> 38:19.772
Whoa, they're back!

38:44.028 --> 38:46.232
Man, that was crazy!

38:46.257 --> 38:48.877
- We're so close to getting busted.
- Tell me about it.

38:48.902 --> 38:51.815
I thought you were
going to pee your pants!

38:51.840 --> 38:54.743
- I did!
- You did!

39:01.311 --> 39:03.838
Mel, food...

39:05.270 --> 39:07.423
Ugh. Hey, Mel.
Hold on a sec.

39:07.448 --> 39:08.873
We're tired, cold, and hungry.

39:08.898 --> 39:10.907
- Mel, hungry.
- Mel, hungry.

39:11.395 --> 39:14.447
It's pizza. Over there.
There's food, spaghetti!

39:14.924 --> 39:17.881
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

39:20.082 --> 39:22.608
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

39:22.633 --> 39:24.618
Hey!
What are you doing?

39:24.753 --> 39:27.189
Intruders!
Intruders!

39:33.363 --> 39:35.473
Stop!
Hey, you! Don't move!

39:35.498 --> 39:36.679
Halt!

39:42.407 --> 39:44.187
Call for backup!

39:44.212 --> 39:47.088
Come on. Come on.
Let's keep going.

40:01.819 --> 40:04.230
Well, you got us here.
Sing something.

40:05.175 --> 40:07.456
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

40:46.658 --> 40:48.521
Get 'em!
Go! Go!

41:25.860 --> 41:27.096
Hey, you!
Freeze!

41:27.121 --> 41:28.617
Don't move!

41:29.584 --> 41:31.383
Hands in the air!

41:38.846 --> 41:42.458
Face it, Gru.
Villainy is in your blood.

41:42.624 --> 41:45.609
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush.  A little?

41:45.634 --> 41:48.867
Well…
Yeah, maybe a little.

41:48.892 --> 41:51.768
And now you've got a chance
to get back on top.

41:51.793 --> 41:54.614
Get your mojo back.
Become Gru again!

41:54.639 --> 41:57.402
How awesome would that be?

41:59.134 --> 42:03.403
Oh please, come on,
just one heist.

42:03.415 --> 42:07.321
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere,

42:07.346 --> 42:10.595
that you still want to steal.

42:12.450 --> 42:15.802
Hmmmm…
There is something.

42:15.827 --> 42:22.012
How about we steal
the largest diamond in the world?

42:22.037 --> 42:24.814
Yes!
I love it!

42:25.175 --> 42:26.687
Oh, thank you, Brother!

42:26.712 --> 42:29.770
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart!

42:31.955 --> 42:35.150
Oh! You know what?
We should do something to celebrate.

42:35.175 --> 42:39.336
Ohhhh.
I've got the perfect idea.

42:42.091 --> 42:43.367
Fritz, my good fellow.

42:43.392 --> 42:45.177
Could you get me
another napkin, please?

42:45.202 --> 42:47.667
Oh yes, of course, Miss Edith.

42:54.659 --> 42:56.244
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

42:56.269 --> 42:58.626
Here we are!

42:58.714 --> 43:00.592
How's it going?

43:01.604 --> 43:03.411
It's me, Gru.

43:03.436 --> 43:05.957
And me, Dru.

43:06.327 --> 43:10.411
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

43:10.436 --> 43:13.105
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

43:13.501 --> 43:14.564
Oh!

43:14.597 --> 43:17.877
What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

43:17.902 --> 43:20.792
I'm so grumpy all the time!

43:20.817 --> 43:23.091
Hey!
I laugh a lot!

43:23.116 --> 43:25.723
And I'm kind of an idiot!

43:35.376 --> 43:37.226
Oh, bust in the gut.

43:37.251 --> 43:41.413
Look at them!
They had no idea!

43:41.438 --> 43:42.998
Total burn.

43:43.023 --> 43:45.103
Oh, look,
it's me...Gru!

43:45.128 --> 43:48.593
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

43:48.618 --> 43:51.008
Awww. It's so nice to see
you two are getting along

43:51.033 --> 43:54.450
- Oh, we're getting...
- Along perfectly.

43:54.618 --> 43:56.106
- Wait. Did we...
- Just finish...

43:56.131 --> 43:57.128
- Each...
- Other's...

43:57.153 --> 43:58.601
- Sentences?
- Sentences?

43:59.560 --> 44:02.157
Aw, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.615
And you're gonna stop now,
though, right?

44:03.640 --> 44:05.897
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

44:05.922 --> 44:07.471
Uh-huh.

44:07.496 --> 44:11.326
So...
what did you guys do today?

44:11.351 --> 44:13.136
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

44:13.464 --> 44:14.558
Okay.
What is it...

44:14.583 --> 44:15.947
All done!

44:16.452 --> 44:17.366
Pardon me!

44:17.391 --> 44:19.348
Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

44:19.373 --> 44:21.923
Hey, hey, hey, put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

44:21.948 --> 44:24.731
I need to go to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

44:24.756 --> 44:26.337
Good night!

44:27.873 --> 44:29.328
What was that about?

44:29.353 --> 44:33.229
Agnes thinks she's going to find
a real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.414
She's totally freaking out.

44:35.439 --> 44:37.811
I feel like someone got's to
tell her the truth.…

44:37.836 --> 44:39.056
Not it!

44:39.189 --> 44:40.776
Ohhh, don't worry.

44:40.801 --> 44:43.860
Parenting 101.
I've got this.

44:45.604 --> 44:48.888
Ummm… And please bless that
when I find the unicorn,

44:48.913 --> 44:51.934
he'll want to come home with me.
And sleep in my room.

44:51.959 --> 44:55.207
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

44:55.232 --> 44:58.906
And he will use his magical powers
to help me do math.

44:58.931 --> 45:00.251
Amen.

45:02.597 --> 45:04.474
Oh.
Hi, Gru.

45:05.013 --> 45:09.020
Hey.
So… big day tomorrow.

45:09.045 --> 45:11.775
Yeah, I'm finally going to
get to see a unicorn!

45:11.800 --> 45:13.319
For reals.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.680
If I do, can I bring it home,
please?

45:16.705 --> 45:18.811
Ohhh.
Yeah, sure.

45:18.836 --> 45:21.694
Tell you what,
every unicorn you find,

45:21.719 --> 45:23.474
you can bring it home.

45:23.499 --> 45:26.757
I'd better build a big pen, right?

45:27.377 --> 45:29.779
But you know…

45:29.904 --> 45:33.517
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

45:34.081 --> 45:35.394
Huh?

45:36.059 --> 45:37.239
I'm...

45:37.264 --> 45:41.858
It might not be good
unicorn finding weather.

45:43.214 --> 45:44.376
Umm.

45:44.401 --> 45:47.749
They're tricky to find them…

45:47.774 --> 45:49.735
and I don't know…

45:49.760 --> 45:59.051
Maybe, just...
maybe unicorns don't really ex...

45:59.531 --> 46:04.422
...explore that part of the woods.

46:07.028 --> 46:08.824
But the man said

46:08.849 --> 46:12.022
a maiden could find one
if she was pure of heart.

46:12.047 --> 46:14.828
And I'm pure of heart, right?

46:15.429 --> 46:17.356
The purest.

46:21.432 --> 46:24.919
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

46:24.944 --> 46:26.564
Goodnight, sweetie.

46:26.589 --> 46:28.477
Goodnight, Gru.

46:29.271 --> 46:34.921
Here comes a unicorn.
Here comes a unicorn.

46:35.111 --> 46:37.210
Huh!
Aaaah!

46:38.734 --> 46:40.426
I'm okay.

46:47.436 --> 46:48.555
Uh.

46:48.580 --> 46:50.900
Hey!
Get that back!

46:55.339 --> 46:57.453
Oh, no!
Run!

47:22.745 --> 47:24.952
We've been waiting a long time.

47:25.279 --> 47:27.324
No. No.
Ow!

47:28.484 --> 47:29.659
Huh!

47:30.183 --> 47:31.682
Gru?

47:53.943 --> 47:56.802
My plane... broke.

48:05.359 --> 48:06.730
Oh.

48:08.229 --> 48:09.488
Uh?

48:09.513 --> 48:10.775
Huh!

48:20.862 --> 48:22.502
Buddies, I've decided.

48:22.527 --> 48:26.956
We're going back to Gru.
We're going back to Gru!

48:31.892 --> 48:35.665
Because I'm training for
the big day,

48:35.690 --> 48:38.416
nobody's gonna stop me

48:38.441 --> 48:44.053
'cause I am super sassy.
Super sassy. Super sassy.

48:44.180 --> 48:46.216
What's today's plan, boss?

48:46.241 --> 48:47.912
What's the plan?

48:47.937 --> 48:50.191
Silly robot.
I'll show you the plan.

48:50.216 --> 48:53.296
Time to watch a very
special episode of Evil Bratt

48:53.321 --> 48:57.230
to see exactly what I'm going
to do to stupid Tinseltown.

48:58.380 --> 49:01.645
This week on Evil Bratt.

49:03.077 --> 49:08.404
It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!
Open fire!

49:12.869 --> 49:16.426
Nice try, coppers.
Chew on this!

49:18.656 --> 49:22.823
He's shooting his super sticky
self inflating gum!

49:23.198 --> 49:24.831
Run!

49:25.349 --> 49:27.859
Gum one!
Gum all!

49:29.751 --> 49:31.087
Gum one.
Gum all.

49:31.112 --> 49:34.751
Seriously, how did this show
never win an Emmy?

49:36.929 --> 49:40.077
And now, it's your turn to...

49:50.871 --> 49:51.863
Hey, Clive.

49:51.888 --> 49:56.170
I guess you can say our plan
was... out of this world.

50:00.079 --> 50:02.395
Now that's entertainment.

50:02.420 --> 50:05.353
Come on.
Let's make it a reality.

50:08.570 --> 50:12.083
Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest,

50:12.108 --> 50:14.316
in search of the
mythical unicorn.

50:14.341 --> 50:15.819
For some reason.

50:15.852 --> 50:19.239
And here she is,
the fearless unicorn hunter, seeking the...

50:19.264 --> 50:20.672
Edith, stop it!

50:20.697 --> 50:22.906
You're gonna scare away the unicorn!

50:22.931 --> 50:25.361
If somehow we actually
find a unicorn,

50:25.386 --> 50:27.344
I'm gonna film it
and get rich.

50:27.369 --> 50:29.248
Look over there!

50:29.494 --> 50:31.367
Wooah!

50:31.751 --> 50:34.468
This is it!
This is where we're gonna see it!

50:34.937 --> 50:37.942
Unicorns, here we come.

50:38.129 --> 50:39.095
What's that for?

50:39.120 --> 50:41.118
Bait.
Duh.

50:41.143 --> 50:42.581
Come on!

50:44.653 --> 50:47.219
Now all we have
to do is wait.

50:50.996 --> 50:52.720
Okay.
This is Bratt's lair.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.801
It may not look like much,
but this place is armed

50:54.826 --> 50:57.973
with some of the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

50:57.998 --> 51:00.160
It's considered impenetrable.

51:00.185 --> 51:03.226
But a piece of cake for us,
right, Brother?

51:03.251 --> 51:07.501
This is not like stealing lollipops.

51:08.603 --> 51:10.603
Whoa!

51:12.020 --> 51:17.195
This security system can detect
an air assault from any direction.

51:18.652 --> 51:20.223
No!
Ouch!

51:20.248 --> 51:21.809
No!
Ouch!

51:21.834 --> 51:24.524
Please! Stop!
Ouch!

51:25.584 --> 51:29.190
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

51:29.215 --> 51:30.394
Next.

51:31.989 --> 51:34.290
Then there are these deadly spikes.

51:34.315 --> 51:37.305
Ha ha ha ha!
Geronimo!

51:37.330 --> 51:42.030
Covered with enough poison
to blow your mind... literally.

51:42.055 --> 51:44.050
Ouch!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

51:44.075 --> 51:45.523
Ah...
Good to know.

51:45.548 --> 51:46.762
So here's the plan.

51:46.787 --> 51:49.814
You're the getaway driver.

51:49.914 --> 51:51.354
So you'll wait in the boat.

51:51.379 --> 51:53.561
Wait, hold on.
Wait in the boat?

51:53.586 --> 51:57.230
But... I want to be
in on the actions!

51:57.740 --> 52:01.842
The getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

52:01.867 --> 52:06.423
Do you know how hard it is
doing nothing, touching nothing,

52:06.448 --> 52:09.514
with all of the adrenaline
coursing through your veins…

52:09.539 --> 52:11.253
and you must wait.

52:11.278 --> 52:13.243
Can I count on you?

52:14.244 --> 52:16.066
I guess so…

52:16.091 --> 52:20.069
So... I'll climb up the cube
and enter here.

52:20.094 --> 52:22.510
Then once I'm inside,
I'll find the diamond.

52:22.535 --> 52:26.634
I've underestimated Bratt before.
This is not going to be easy.

52:26.659 --> 52:29.334
I think we can handle it.

52:31.407 --> 52:35.201
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable.

52:35.226 --> 52:37.488
Whoa.
Ay, chihuahua!

52:37.513 --> 52:39.268
I got the black one.

52:41.729 --> 52:44.456
It's go time!

52:54.325 --> 52:56.880
Hello.
Oh, hi.

52:56.905 --> 52:59.996
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

53:00.021 --> 53:04.915
I present you with pig to confirm
my engagement to your daughter.

53:07.421 --> 53:08.937
- Hey, what now?
- What's going on?

53:08.962 --> 53:10.430
Remember, little boots?

53:10.455 --> 53:13.856
- Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
- Whoa! Hey!

53:13.881 --> 53:16.267
He seems to think you're engaged.

53:16.900 --> 53:19.102
What?
We're not engaged!

53:19.127 --> 53:22.184
Look, Niko.
You seem like a very nice boy

53:22.209 --> 53:23.731
With a very nice pig.

53:23.756 --> 53:26.102
Uh, but you're not engaged.

53:26.764 --> 53:29.381
Okay?
It's not happening.

53:29.406 --> 53:32.443
I understand.
Who was I kidding?

53:32.468 --> 53:36.424
A dumpling like me with
a goddess like you?

53:36.449 --> 53:40.793
But I promise:
I will never forget you, Margo.

53:40.818 --> 53:42.260
Never.

53:43.584 --> 53:46.256
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I won't forget you, either.

53:46.281 --> 53:48.593
Bye.
Bye, Niko.

53:48.618 --> 53:51.100
Wow, that was crazy!
Wooo!

53:51.125 --> 53:53.339
That was totally humiliating!

53:53.364 --> 53:56.582
Taking a bite of that cheese was
the stupidest thing I've ever done.

53:56.607 --> 53:58.002
Why did I listen to you?

53:58.027 --> 54:00.419
Right, but it's over now, so...

54:00.444 --> 54:03.233
Ugh, here we go.
Niko...

54:03.904 --> 54:07.543
You!
You refuse my son's engagement pig?

54:07.568 --> 54:08.171
What?

54:08.196 --> 54:13.425
May you and your daughter die
a slow death and be buried with onions!

54:15.479 --> 54:17.185
Alright, lady.
That's it!

54:17.210 --> 54:22.612
Nobody...nobody! ...curses my daughter!
You got that?

54:22.637 --> 54:25.593
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!

54:25.618 --> 54:30.146
And I promise, you do not
want to mess with me!

54:30.171 --> 54:32.508
Do you understand me?

54:32.533 --> 54:33.645
Yes, yes.

54:33.670 --> 54:36.574
Good.
Now, GET!

54:39.829 --> 54:42.750
Look, Margo.
I think we just need to... Oh.

54:46.146 --> 54:47.442
Yes!

54:47.467 --> 54:49.854
Oh!
I've to tell Gru!

55:05.802 --> 55:08.468
- Can we go back now?
- Already?

55:08.493 --> 55:10.197
Just a couple more hours!

55:10.222 --> 55:12.707
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

55:13.571 --> 55:15.577
I don't understand.

55:15.602 --> 55:17.920
I did exactly
what the man said.

55:17.945 --> 55:21.253
You mean that one-eyed, scar-faced man
that everybody laughed at?

55:21.278 --> 55:23.589
Yeah.
It makes no sense.

55:23.614 --> 55:26.101
- Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...
- Huh!

55:37.550 --> 55:40.944
My whole life has been
building to this moment!

55:46.797 --> 55:48.027
Um.
It's a...

55:48.052 --> 55:49.861
Unicorn!

55:51.694 --> 55:53.812
I can't believe it!

55:54.237 --> 55:56.829
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

55:57.018 --> 56:00.156
Oh, Lucky, stop it...

56:01.203 --> 56:04.160
Yeah.
I'll let someone else burst her bubble.

56:10.692 --> 56:14.422
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist.

56:14.447 --> 56:20.065
And that diamond will make us
the richest, most powerful villains in the world!

56:20.090 --> 56:21.597
Right, Brother?

56:22.686 --> 56:25.757
Right.
Yeah. Yeah...

56:27.655 --> 56:31.532
Bravo! Bravissimo!
You're amazing.

56:31.557 --> 56:33.952
I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

56:33.977 --> 56:36.186
- And you were always such a gentleman.
- You did it! You did it!

56:36.211 --> 56:38.116
You got our jobs back.

56:44.576 --> 56:46.707
Oh yeah. Right.
Sure.

56:46.732 --> 56:48.615
Oh look, we're here!

56:55.407 --> 56:57.836
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.

56:57.861 --> 57:00.423
I still don't see
why I can't go with you.

57:00.448 --> 57:01.977
Hey.
Hey, we discussed this.

57:02.002 --> 57:04.456
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

57:04.481 --> 57:06.268
Fine...

57:19.503 --> 57:21.294
- Hey, brother.
- What?

57:21.319 --> 57:24.058
I told you, you were
supposed to stay with the boat!

57:24.083 --> 57:26.978
Oh, I didn't think
you meant that literally.

57:27.003 --> 57:29.422
What other way
could I have meant it?

57:30.027 --> 57:33.303
Alright. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

57:33.328 --> 57:34.875
Got it.

57:38.274 --> 57:40.440
Help me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

57:40.465 --> 57:42.485
Oh no!
The poison spikes!

57:42.510 --> 57:45.173
Oh, I'm gonna be impaled!

57:47.049 --> 57:49.384
Ha ha!
I'm okay!

57:49.648 --> 57:51.585
I missed the Minions.

57:51.610 --> 57:52.929
Come on!

57:58.861 --> 58:00.442
Coming.

58:06.168 --> 58:07.671
Coming.

58:12.136 --> 58:13.533
Come on.

58:19.101 --> 58:20.808
It's a scanning device!

58:20.833 --> 58:22.953
Quick... camouflage mode.

58:23.323 --> 58:25.300
Freeze!
And close your eyes.

58:25.325 --> 58:27.137
And cover your mouth!

58:32.903 --> 58:34.903
Okay.
Take my hand!

58:57.990 --> 59:00.935
Ha ha.
Follow me!

59:17.527 --> 59:18.822
Ha ha.

59:24.027 --> 59:25.852
Look out!

59:29.726 --> 59:33.025
You're right.
I should've stay in the boat.

59:33.079 --> 59:35.897
My stomach feels all queasy.

59:35.922 --> 59:39.761
I shouldn't have eaten
that hot pie.

59:40.139 --> 59:42.654
Hey. Hey.
Relax.

59:42.679 --> 59:46.520
You're going to be just fine.
I got your back.

59:52.678 --> 59:54.445
Come on, this way.

59:56.393 --> 59:58.282
Gru would take this.
Gru would take that.

59:58.307 --> 59:59.895
Go, go, go!

59:59.920 --> 1:00:01.730
Eh, Peter, that way.

1:00:01.755 --> 1:00:03.104
Oh, okay.

1:00:24.634 --> 1:00:26.312
Go, go.
Go, go, go.

1:00:39.087 --> 1:00:40.984
Huh?
Hey, come back.

1:00:51.043 --> 1:00:54.337
Hello. Hello.
Hello.

1:01:00.965 --> 1:01:02.905
You jacket is located
within easy reach.

1:01:02.930 --> 1:01:05.851
Inflate your jacket by pulling the toggle.
Like this...

1:01:05.883 --> 1:01:08.184
Thank for your attention,
enjoy your flight.

1:01:13.864 --> 1:01:17.730
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

1:01:19.238 --> 1:01:21.777
Bud-Buddy.
Bud-Buddy!

1:01:22.391 --> 1:01:25.416
Buddy!!!

1:01:25.855 --> 1:01:27.601
It looks like
it's right above us.

1:01:27.626 --> 1:01:30.201
Okay! What do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

1:01:30.226 --> 1:01:31.999
No.
Come with me.

1:01:47.557 --> 1:01:49.782
I'd like to thank the Academy.

1:01:52.128 --> 1:01:53.613
- I can...
- No no no no no...

1:01:53.638 --> 1:01:56.081
- Why? I can do it.
- Don't, don't, don't!

1:01:56.106 --> 1:01:59.250
Yes, yes, Molly Ringwald.
I will take you to the prom.

1:01:59.275 --> 1:02:02.289
What... Who… Where...
What... Who's there…?

1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:12.846
Ninety nine red balloons...

1:02:12.871 --> 1:02:14.699
Whoops!
Almost forgot.

1:02:25.290 --> 1:02:27.610
Shh, shh.
Over here!

1:02:29.227 --> 1:02:30.765
Stay close.

1:02:35.207 --> 1:02:36.504
Dolls.

1:02:36.529 --> 1:02:40.388
Looks like Bratt was the only one
stupid enough to buy this junk.

1:02:40.413 --> 1:02:43.537
Oh.
I used to have one of these!

1:02:43.562 --> 1:02:45.907
Pew pew pew!

1:02:45.932 --> 1:02:48.884
Aaah!
Oww!

1:02:48.909 --> 1:02:51.028
Hey! Shh!
Come on!

1:02:58.599 --> 1:03:01.629
Alright.
We're getting close.

1:03:01.654 --> 1:03:06.044
From now on, every move must be
made with ultra precision and purpose.

1:03:07.823 --> 1:03:09.063
Gum!

1:03:09.088 --> 1:03:10.496
Focus!

1:03:10.521 --> 1:03:13.120
We're after the diamond,
not the bubble gum!

1:03:13.145 --> 1:03:14.810
Ah, got it.

1:03:17.121 --> 1:03:19.102
Mmm.
Yum.

1:03:20.205 --> 1:03:21.671
This way!

1:03:22.284 --> 1:03:25.591
And now to put this
where it belongs.

1:03:26.850 --> 1:03:27.583
What?

1:03:27.608 --> 1:03:31.222
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

1:03:37.085 --> 1:03:40.051
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us.

1:03:42.221 --> 1:03:45.681
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

1:03:48.724 --> 1:03:52.061
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!

1:03:54.009 --> 1:03:56.112
Freeze, dipsticks!

1:03:56.137 --> 1:03:58.688
Gru!
There's two of you now?

1:03:58.713 --> 1:04:01.464
Then this will be
twice as much fun.

1:04:08.051 --> 1:04:10.307
Aaaaah!
Give me back my diamond!

1:04:10.332 --> 1:04:12.300
Total lockdown!!

1:04:12.325 --> 1:04:14.487
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!!

1:04:22.775 --> 1:04:25.867
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

1:04:31.123 --> 1:04:32.582
Run!

1:04:38.870 --> 1:04:40.129
Oh no…

1:04:40.154 --> 1:04:42.717
Oh no?
What does that mean?

1:04:42.742 --> 1:04:45.850
ARE WE GONNA DIE??
ARE WE GONNA DIE??

1:04:45.875 --> 1:04:47.765
WE'RE GONNA DIE!!

1:04:57.153 --> 1:04:58.372
What?

1:04:58.859 --> 1:05:01.082
Hey, guys.
Hold on!

1:05:01.107 --> 1:05:03.014
Lucy!

1:05:09.714 --> 1:05:12.491
Thank you for saving us!
Woo!

1:05:12.516 --> 1:05:15.033
“Look! We got the diamond!
And we're going to...

1:05:15.058 --> 1:05:18.775
Take it to the AVL
and get our job back!

1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:19.578
Wait!

1:05:19.603 --> 1:05:21.196
What?
That's amazing!

1:05:21.221 --> 1:05:24.406
And the best part is
you are never ever

1:05:24.431 --> 1:05:28.309
go behind my back ever again!

1:05:28.334 --> 1:05:31.332
- Right, honeybear?
- Yup! Yup! Right.

1:05:31.357 --> 1:05:33.077
Lesson learned.

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:48.662
I'll get the girls and start packing
and tell them the good news!

1:05:48.687 --> 1:05:50.876
Ah, we're getting
our jobs back, yeah!

1:05:50.901 --> 1:05:53.378
Yes. Yes.
Go tell the girls.

1:05:54.499 --> 1:05:55.241
Dru.

1:05:55.266 --> 1:05:58.355
No. No way!
We can't give the diamond back!

1:05:58.380 --> 1:06:00.889
- I have to.
- No, you don't!

1:06:00.914 --> 1:06:02.925
- Yes, I do.
- Give it.

1:06:02.950 --> 1:06:04.323
- No!
- Give it!

1:06:04.348 --> 1:06:06.240
Ow!
What is wrong with you?

1:06:06.265 --> 1:06:07.567
What is wrong with you?

1:06:07.592 --> 1:06:08.528
You kicked me!

1:06:08.553 --> 1:06:09.969
You-You lied to me.

1:06:09.994 --> 1:06:11.932
Hey.
I would have told you the truth.

1:06:11.957 --> 1:06:14.879
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

1:06:14.904 --> 1:06:16.394
That's it, I'm out of here.

1:06:16.419 --> 1:06:19.410
You have no right to take that,
we stole it together.

1:06:19.435 --> 1:06:21.027
Together?

1:06:21.437 --> 1:06:22.754
You got to be kidding me.

1:06:22.779 --> 1:06:24.997
You did nothing but
screwed up the whole time.

1:06:25.022 --> 1:06:26.757
I got this
in spite of you.

1:06:26.782 --> 1:06:29.771
Oh, yeah?
Well, at least I didn't get fired

1:06:29.796 --> 1:06:32.158
from my job
like a total loser.

1:06:32.183 --> 1:06:33.868
At least I had a job.

1:06:33.893 --> 1:06:35.965
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

1:06:35.990 --> 1:06:39.170
I'll tell you what:
Nothing!

1:06:39.392 --> 1:06:42.953
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

1:06:44.715 --> 1:06:46.775
We're no longer brothers!

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:48.568
That's fine with me!

1:07:30.923 --> 1:07:34.668
Gru!
I found a unicorn!

1:07:36.525 --> 1:07:38.681
My life is complete!

1:07:41.014 --> 1:07:45.861
Honey, that's...
that's not actually a unicorn.

1:07:47.445 --> 1:07:51.096
But-But he has one horn.

1:07:51.230 --> 1:07:54.299
I'm-I'm sorry, sweetie,
but...

1:07:54.324 --> 1:07:57.138
he's just a goat.

1:07:57.163 --> 1:08:00.278
Life is just like that sometimes.

1:08:00.303 --> 1:08:02.735
We're hoping for a unicorn

1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:05.022
and we get a goat.

1:08:06.834 --> 1:08:08.968
Well, you know what?

1:08:08.993 --> 1:08:13.083
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

1:08:13.108 --> 1:08:17.421
Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.

1:08:21.735 --> 1:08:23.420
I'll take this.

1:08:23.445 --> 1:08:26.540
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

1:08:26.565 --> 1:08:28.580
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

1:08:28.605 --> 1:08:30.412
Come on, girls, let's go!

1:08:30.437 --> 1:08:34.539
Let's get physical, physical!

1:08:41.155 --> 1:08:43.251
Change of plan, girls.

1:08:43.276 --> 1:08:45.436
Instead of going home...

1:08:45.461 --> 1:08:47.632
Eyebrows.
Ow!

1:08:47.764 --> 1:08:50.973
We're going to Hollywood!

1:08:52.056 --> 1:08:55.078
Now that's what I call acting.

1:08:55.649 --> 1:08:59.373
Let's go, Clive.
We've got a giant robot waiting.

1:09:02.185 --> 1:09:03.217
Huh?

1:09:04.212 --> 1:09:06.487
Huh?
Lucy?

1:09:07.818 --> 1:09:09.542
Bratt, he took the girls!

1:09:09.567 --> 1:09:10.766
What?

1:09:14.319 --> 1:09:16.250
Dru!
Dru!

1:09:16.264 --> 1:09:18.986
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

1:09:19.011 --> 1:09:21.537
Bratt has the girls!

1:09:27.721 --> 1:09:29.692
Listen, brother.
What...

1:09:29.732 --> 1:09:31.989
- About what I said.
- No, I'm the one...

1:09:32.014 --> 1:09:33.779
But I shouldn't have...

1:09:33.804 --> 1:09:36.089
I'm-I'm sorry.

1:09:37.030 --> 1:09:39.465
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1:09:39.490 --> 1:09:41.333
Awww.

1:09:41.682 --> 1:09:43.346
Oh, look out!

1:09:43.371 --> 1:09:44.968
What is that?

1:09:45.277 --> 1:09:47.672
Hey. Hey!
Infront!

1:09:48.729 --> 1:09:50.522
Caramba!
Caramba!

1:09:50.547 --> 1:09:53.203
CARAMBAAAAA!

1:09:53.228 --> 1:09:54.416
Mel?

1:09:54.441 --> 1:09:56.180
Huh?
Gru?

1:09:57.532 --> 1:10:00.081
Got to turn this thing around...

1:10:00.711 --> 1:10:01.790
Gru!

1:10:01.815 --> 1:10:06.339
Wait for us.
GRUUUUU...

1:10:30.218 --> 1:10:33.652
Hello, Hollywood!

1:10:33.677 --> 1:10:36.912
I'm back and bigger than ever.

1:10:38.421 --> 1:10:39.970
I'm scared!

1:10:39.995 --> 1:10:42.727
Thank you.
Thank you so...

1:10:48.277 --> 1:10:49.875
You can't leave me here!

1:10:49.900 --> 1:10:51.507
I've paid this!

1:10:52.244 --> 1:10:54.847
Clive, arm the cannons.

1:10:57.044 --> 1:10:59.739
Chew on this!

1:11:16.215 --> 1:11:18.853
Hey, mullet-head.
Let us out!

1:11:18.878 --> 1:11:20.877
Oh, don't worry, girls.

1:11:20.902 --> 1:11:24.471
I've prepared
a front row seat for you.

1:11:40.211 --> 1:11:42.224
- Waaah!
- Agnes!

1:11:43.383 --> 1:11:46.973
Once again, I win
and Gru loses.

1:11:46.998 --> 1:11:49.331
Enjoy the show, girls.

1:11:56.639 --> 1:11:58.357
What in the heck?

1:11:58.505 --> 1:12:00.346
I hope the girls are okay.

1:12:00.371 --> 1:12:01.386
Bratt!
Brother!

1:12:01.411 --> 1:12:03.662
9 o'clock. No.
3 o'clock.

1:12:03.687 --> 1:12:05.369
He's on the left!

1:12:07.124 --> 1:12:09.488
Huh, no.
I've seen this episode.

1:12:09.513 --> 1:12:11.145
He's going to bubble gum
the whole city

1:12:11.170 --> 1:12:13.294
and send it up into space.

1:12:13.319 --> 1:12:14.802
Hurry!

1:12:25.423 --> 1:12:27.361
This is it.
This is it.

1:12:27.386 --> 1:12:29.820
Lights!
Camera!

1:12:29.916 --> 1:12:31.719
LASER!

1:12:41.748 --> 1:12:43.465
Yeah.

1:12:49.378 --> 1:12:51.025
Look.
I got the girls.

1:12:51.050 --> 1:12:52.398
You two go
take care of Bratt.

1:12:52.423 --> 1:12:54.445
Wait.
What are you doing?

1:13:00.230 --> 1:13:01.925
Look, you guys.
It's Lucy.

1:13:01.950 --> 1:13:04.335
Lucy, over here.
Help! Help us!

1:13:04.367 --> 1:13:06.169
Mama's coming, girls.

1:13:06.194 --> 1:13:08.034
- Lucy!
- Right here!

1:13:08.641 --> 1:13:10.195
Look at that laser go.

1:13:10.220 --> 1:13:12.524
I love it when a
plan comes together.

1:13:12.549 --> 1:13:15.320
Aaaah!
It's Gru!

1:13:17.392 --> 1:13:18.776
Get ready, Bratt.

1:13:18.801 --> 1:13:22.016
You're about to be blasted
back to the 80's.

1:13:33.496 --> 1:13:36.530
Ah ho!
We got him!

1:13:44.875 --> 1:13:46.225
- Oh no.
- Don't worry.

1:13:46.250 --> 1:13:48.298
There's more where that came from.

1:13:48.323 --> 1:13:50.938
It'll take more than
that to stop me.

1:13:50.963 --> 1:13:53.867
Bratt pack,
go get that barf bag.

1:14:01.659 --> 1:14:03.915
Oh, incoming!

1:14:04.901 --> 1:14:06.335
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:07.863
You, little...

1:14:15.088 --> 1:14:16.888
Quick!
Jump!

1:14:18.995 --> 1:14:20.458
Boners!

1:14:20.483 --> 1:14:23.078
Did you see that, Clive?
All gone.

1:14:23.103 --> 1:14:25.285
Bye bye, Wonder Twins.

1:14:43.556 --> 1:14:45.314
Whoa!
Ooh la la!

1:14:45.339 --> 1:14:47.456
What are all those bubbles?

1:14:53.237 --> 1:14:54.650
Help!

1:14:54.727 --> 1:14:55.830
Help!

1:14:55.855 --> 1:14:57.330
Hang on!

1:15:04.686 --> 1:15:07.308
Hang on, girls!
I got you!

1:15:07.385 --> 1:15:10.267
I can't.
I'm slipping!

1:15:11.309 --> 1:15:13.207
No!

1:15:14.478 --> 1:15:15.808
Gotcha.

1:15:18.048 --> 1:15:19.438
Thank you, Lucy.

1:15:19.463 --> 1:15:21.969
Let's go!
We're not safe yet!

1:15:24.730 --> 1:15:26.962
Minions, time to do
what we do best.

1:15:26.987 --> 1:15:29.898
We will cheer for our boss.
We will fight for our boss.

1:15:29.923 --> 1:15:31.678
We'll pop the bubbles!

1:15:31.703 --> 1:15:32.960
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1:15:32.985 --> 1:15:34.645
- Villain!
- Villain!

1:15:34.670 --> 1:15:37.659
You guys too!
You guys are villains!

1:15:50.627 --> 1:15:52.843
Look at what we have here.

1:15:52.868 --> 1:15:57.490
Sorry, Gru.
This is going to be a total burn.

1:16:02.224 --> 1:16:05.582
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no...

1:16:09.442 --> 1:16:12.735
I've been a bad boy!

1:16:20.177 --> 1:16:24.131
Nobody messes with my brother!

1:16:26.925 --> 1:16:28.003
Aaaah!

1:16:28.028 --> 1:16:29.650
Aaaaahh!

1:16:35.192 --> 1:16:37.346
What?
What's happening?

1:16:50.156 --> 1:16:52.216
Dru!

1:16:52.503 --> 1:16:54.399
Hold on!
I'm coming!

1:16:58.555 --> 1:17:01.143
You've ruined everything.

1:17:01.168 --> 1:17:03.655
And now, it's time to die.

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.371
Any last words, Gru?

1:17:06.593 --> 1:17:08.090
You know what?

1:17:08.115 --> 1:17:10.834
I got two words for you.

1:17:11.405 --> 1:17:13.111
Dance fight.

1:17:13.939 --> 1:17:17.662
Oh, it is alright, Donkey Kong.

1:17:17.687 --> 1:17:20.827
I'm going to enjoy this.

1:17:40.022 --> 1:17:41.329
Enough!

1:17:41.718 --> 1:17:43.051
My turn.

1:18:02.911 --> 1:18:04.453
Oh oh.

1:18:07.721 --> 1:18:09.507
Game over!

1:18:11.984 --> 1:18:15.210
Is this what you're looking for?

1:18:15.235 --> 1:18:16.626
No!

1:18:17.063 --> 1:18:18.998
Ow. Ow.
Ow.

1:18:26.282 --> 1:18:28.606
No...!

1:18:31.754 --> 1:18:34.211
Curse you, Gru!

1:18:34.658 --> 1:18:36.409
Curse you.

1:18:36.434 --> 1:18:39.141
Bill, over there.
Robert, work your pick.

1:18:39.166 --> 1:18:40.936
Chuck, more bashing.

1:18:45.110 --> 1:18:46.427
Dru.

1:18:46.452 --> 1:18:47.716
Dru.

1:18:55.123 --> 1:18:57.342
Hey, we did it.

1:18:57.705 --> 1:19:00.205
Yes, we did, brother.

1:19:00.230 --> 1:19:03.284
- Gru!
- Gru!

1:19:16.934 --> 1:19:18.039
Gru!

Hey, Mel.
Welcome back.

1:19:53.586 --> 1:19:55.353
Love you, Mom.

1:19:59.832 --> 1:20:03.107
I'm a Mom.
I'm a Mom!

1:20:05.999 --> 1:20:08.206
Fight!
Ha ha!

1:20:13.506 --> 1:20:14.210
Ha ha ha...

1:20:14.235 --> 1:20:15.732
Cheater!

1:20:15.757 --> 1:20:18.339
- How do you like this, Cheater?
- No. No.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.453
Boys.
Time for bed.

1:20:21.478 --> 1:20:23.485
We're back at work
in the morning.

1:20:23.661 --> 1:20:26.782

- Hi, Lucy.

1:20:26.807 --> 1:20:28.523
See you tomorrow, brother.

1:20:28.548 --> 1:20:31.804
Hey, I'm back on the job.
So no villainy tonight.

1:20:31.829 --> 1:20:33.001
Huh, got it?

1:20:33.026 --> 1:20:36.200
I make no promises.
Love you!

1:20:36.225 --> 1:20:38.155
Uh-huh, right.

1:20:38.366 --> 1:20:40.019
I love you too.

1:20:40.044 --> 1:20:41.976
- Awwww.

1:20:42.817 --> 1:20:44.657
Alright, every...
Go. Go.

1:20:44.682 --> 1:20:46.151
Go to bed.

1:20:50.359 --> 1:20:52.867
Hey. Guys.
Come on.

1:21:09.490 --> 1:21:13.481
- What is happening?
- It's coming from outside!

1:21:15.478 --> 1:21:18.919
Hey, I thought we said
no more villainy!

1:21:18.944 --> 1:21:20.248
Sorry, brother.

1:21:20.273 --> 1:21:23.424
- Somebody's got to keep
the family tradition alive.
- Yoo-hoo.

1:21:23.449 --> 1:21:24.494
Right?

1:21:24.519 --> 1:21:26.722
- Yeah!

1:21:26.747 --> 1:21:28.599
- Yeah!

1:21:34.295 --> 1:21:35.955
Let's get him.

1:21:36.291 --> 1:21:38.656
Honey, he's my brother.

1:21:38.681 --> 1:21:41.267
We'll give him
a 5 minute head start.
