02:26.390 --> 02:28.260
Master Kaecilius.

02:29.390 --> 02:33.230
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.430
Hypocrite!

05:05.840 --> 05:07.170
Challenge round, Billy.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.220
Oh, come on, Billy, you've got to be messing with me.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.760
No, doctor.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.850
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.640
Honestly, Billy, you said this one would be hard.

05:20.860 --> 05:22.720
- Ha! it's 1978. - No, Billy.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.400
While Feels So Good may have charted in 1978...

05:25.570 --> 05:28.940
the album was released in December of 1977.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.700
No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

05:30.780 --> 05:31.820
Check again.

05:31.910 --> 05:34.200
Where do you store all this useless information?

05:34.290 --> 05:35.280
Useless?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.070
The man charted a top 10 hit with a flugeihorn.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.110
Status, Billy?

05:39.290 --> 05:40.280
1977.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.670
- Oh, please. - I hate you.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.960
Oh!

05:43.050 --> 05:44.960
Feels so good, doesn't it?

05:48.930 --> 05:50.130
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

05:50.220 --> 05:52.090
Youve done your bit. Go ahead. Well close up.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.170
What is it?

05:54.270 --> 05:55.430
GSW.

05:56.770 --> 05:57.970
it's amazing you kept him alive.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.910
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

05:59.910 --> 06:01.100
and the apnea reflex test.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.810
I think I found the problem, Doctor Palmer.

06:04.070 --> 06:05.560
You left a bullet in his head.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.270
Thanks. it's impinging on the medulla.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.860
I needed a specialist. Nic diagnosed brain death.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.690
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

06:11.780 --> 06:12.770
We have to run.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.320
Doctor West.

06:15.580 --> 06:16.820
What are you doing? Hey.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.320
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

06:18.790 --> 06:19.950
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.120
I don't need you to. Weve already called brain death.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.370
Prematurely. We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.

06:24.670 --> 06:26.290
Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.

06:26.590 --> 06:27.830
What do you see?

06:28.050 --> 06:29.880
- A bullet? - A perfect bullet.

06:30.140 --> 06:30.860
it's been hardened.

06:30.860 --> 06:32.800
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.630
A toxic metal. And that's leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

06:36.890 --> 06:38.430
Rapid onset central nervous system shutdown.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.510
We gotta go.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.100
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.600
Still want to harvest his organs?

06:43.690 --> 06:45.020
- I'll assist you. - No.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.140
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

07:03.380 --> 07:04.960
Thank you.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.210
Image guidance, stat.

07:13.390 --> 07:14.880
We don't have time for that.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.670
You cant do it freehand.

07:16.890 --> 07:18.010
I can and I will.

07:18.270 --> 07:19.930
This isn't a time for showing off, Strange.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.850
How about 10 minutes ago when you called the wrong time of death?

07:32.320 --> 07:34.400
Cranial nenies intact.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.720
Doctor West, cover your watch.

08:44.980 --> 08:47.060
You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.

08:47.150 --> 08:48.640
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

08:48.730 --> 08:51.440
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.890
Nic is a great doctor.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.150
You came to me.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.600
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.780
You had a second opinion.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.280
What you needed was a competent one.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.570
Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.120
You could make such a difference.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.780
I can't work in your butcher shop.

09:03.870 --> 09:04.950
Hey!

09:05.040 --> 09:06.120
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.370
I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.750
The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.250
In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.370
Yeah, youre right.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.920
In ER, were only saving lives.

09:16.010 --> 09:19.550
There's no fame, there's no, uh, CNN interviews.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.500
I guess III just have to stick with Nic.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.630
Whoa, wait a minute.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.960
You're not... You guys aren't...

09:24.060 --> 09:25.300
What?

09:25.390 --> 09:26.440
Sleeping together? Sorry,

09:26.440 --> 09:28.140
I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.770
Explicit, actually.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.100
No, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.

09:32.190 --> 09:33.180
Oh, really?

09:33.280 --> 09:34.360
I call it the Strange Policy."

09:34.440 --> 09:36.980
Oh, well, good, I'm glad somethings named after me.

09:37.570 --> 09:39.400
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.190
And yet, somehow no one seems to want to call it the "Strange Technique."

09:42.410 --> 09:43.900
We invented that technique.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.490
Regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.

09:48.370 --> 09:51.830
I'm talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.240
Come with me.

09:53.420 --> 09:56.200
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.210
You used to love coming to those things with me.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.540
We had fun together.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.300
No! You had fun.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.170
They weren't about us, they were about you.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.340
Not only about me.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.430
Stephen. Everything is about you.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.930
Maybe we could hyphenate.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.100
Strange-Palmer Technique.

10:13.270 --> 10:15.060
Palmer-Strange.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.400
Billy.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.740
What have you got for me?

11:05.830 --> 11:07.110
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force Colonel..

11:07.500 --> 11:10.360
crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor.

11:10.460 --> 11:11.820
Mid-thoracic burst fracture.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.370
Yeah, well, I could help...

11:13.630 --> 11:14.660
but so could 50 other people.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.290
Find me something worth my time.

11:16.590 --> 11:17.990
I have a 68-year-old female

11:17.990 --> 11:19.750
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.580
Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record?

11:22.760 --> 11:24.130
Definitely not.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.340
How about a 22-year-old female...

11:26.720 --> 11:28.810
with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia...

11:28.890 --> 11:30.100
struck by lightning?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.720
Mmm. That does sound interesting.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.020
Can you send me the...

11:35.230 --> 11:36.940
Got it.

12:38.750 --> 12:39.740
Hey.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.540
it's okay. it's gonna be okay.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.560
What did they do?

13:00.820 --> 13:03.020
They rushed you in a chopper.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.190
But it took a little while to find you.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.050
The golden hours for nerve damage went

13:08.050 --> 13:09.440
by while you were in the car.

13:09.530 --> 13:12.200
What did they do?

13:15.330 --> 13:18.070
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.120
Multiple torn ligaments...

13:21.960 --> 13:24.300
severe nerve damage in both hands.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.800
You were on the table for 11 hours.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.800
Look at these fixators.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.390
No one could have done better.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.730
I could have done better.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.330
No.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.090
Give your body time to heal.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.510
You've ruined me.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.020
How long until I can take...

14:20.100 --> 14:21.090
Doctor Strange.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.890
Those tissues are still healing.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.020
So, speed it up.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.860
Pass a stent down the brachial artery into the radial artery.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.930
it's possible.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.990
Experimental and expensive, but possible.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.990
All I need is possible.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.550
Up.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.010
Up.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.510
Show me your strength.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.320
This is useless.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.560
it's not useless, man. You can do this.

15:15.490 --> 15:18.080
All right, answer me this, bachelors degree.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.820
Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage

15:20.920 --> 15:22.500
this severe to do this...

15:22.670 --> 15:23.830
and actually recover?

15:23.920 --> 15:25.450
One guy, yeah.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.000
Factory accident, broke his back...

15:28.090 --> 15:30.500
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.920
He had pain in his shoulder, from the wheelchair.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.550
He came in three times a week.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.890
Then one day he stopped coming.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.930
I thought he was dead.

15:39.020 --> 15:41.100
A few years later, he walked past me on the street.

15:41.350 --> 15:42.680
- Walked? - Yeah, walked.

15:42.770 --> 15:45.640
Bullshit. Show me his file.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.440
Itli take me a while to pull the files from the archive.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.940
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong...

15:51.530 --> 15:52.690
Worth it.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.620
hooked at all your research..

16:09.710 --> 16:11.920
I read all the papers you've sent.

16:12.090 --> 16:13.800
It's not gonna work.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.380
I don't think you realize...

16:15.550 --> 16:18.040
- how severe the damages are. - Here's the thing...

16:18.140 --> 16:19.220
The best have tried and failed.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.140
I understand. Heres the thing.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.350
What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.

16:24.730 --> 16:25.720
Come on.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.560
I've got my own reputation to consider.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.440
- Etienne, wait. No. - l can't help you.

16:29.690 --> 16:30.770
No, no, wait!

16:36.990 --> 16:37.980
Hey!

16:44.420 --> 16:45.950
He won't do it.

16:48.750 --> 16:49.910
He's a hack.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.580
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.460
They culture donor stem cells... and then harvesting them

16:55.680 --> 16:57.010
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

16:57.090 --> 16:58.170
If I could get a loan together...

16:58.350 --> 16:59.340
Stephen.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.050
A small loan, just$200,000.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.220
You've always spent money as fast as you could make it...

17:03.310 --> 17:05.350
but now youre spending money you don't even have.

17:05.770 --> 17:08.140
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.600
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

17:11.780 --> 17:14.440
because, you see, I'm not getting any better!

17:14.780 --> 17:16.440
But this isnt medicine anymore.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.280
This is mania.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.020
Some things just can't be fixed.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.860
Life without my work...

17:22.860 --> 17:23.650
Is still life.

17:23.910 --> 17:24.870
This isnt the end.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.820
There are other things that can give your life meaning.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.710
Like what? Like you?

17:32.170 --> 17:34.460
This is the part where you apologize.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.420
This is the part where you leave.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.960
Fine, I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.300
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.640
Yes, it is.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.970
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.290
No, don't pity me.

17:47.290 --> 17:48.220
I'm not pitying you.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.550
Oh, yeah? Then what are you doing here...

17:49.730 --> 17:51.890
bringing cheese and wine like we're old friends going for a picnic?

17:52.070 --> 17:53.310
We are not friends, Christine.

17:53.570 --> 17:54.730
We were barely lovers.

17:54.820 --> 17:56.650
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

17:56.950 --> 17:58.110
Is that what I am to you now?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.860
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

18:01.080 --> 18:02.060
"He finally needs me."

18:02.160 --> 18:03.870
Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.320
Patch him up and send him back into the world...

18:06.410 --> 18:07.900
heart's just humming.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.330
You care so much, don't you?

18:15.590 --> 18:16.830
Goodbye, Stephen.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.390
- All the way. - Here we go.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.640
Let's go! All day! All day!

19:09.730 --> 19:12.720
Yeah! All day.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.050
Come on, manl Where's the competition?

19:17.230 --> 19:18.570
Talk a lot.

19:19.610 --> 19:20.770
Jonathan Pangborn...

19:21.030 --> 19:23.940
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.660
Who are you?

19:25.740 --> 19:26.730
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.530
Partial paralysis in both hands.

19:28.790 --> 19:29.810
l don't know you.

19:29.810 --> 19:30.740
I'm Stephen Strange.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.910
I'm a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.620
Actually, you know what, man, I do know you.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.500
I came to your office once. You refused to see me.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.090
I never got past your assistant.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.260
You were untreatable.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.750
No glory for you in that, right?

19:49.770 --> 19:52.010
You came back from a place there's no way back from.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.680
I'm trying to find my own way back.

20:01.610 --> 20:03.690
Pang born, are you in or you out?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.290
All right.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.580
Id given up on my body.

20:17.130 --> 20:18.960
I thought my mind's the only thing I have left...

20:19.130 --> 20:21.000
I should at least try to elevate that.

20:21.630 --> 20:25.420
So, I sat with gurus... and sacred women.

20:25.590 --> 20:28.460
Strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.630
And finally...

20:29.970 --> 20:32.470
I found my teacher.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.130
And my mind was elevated...

20:35.310 --> 20:36.470
and my spirit deepened.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.430
And somehow...

20:38.610 --> 20:39.600
Your body healed.

20:39.820 --> 20:40.810
Yes.

20:42.490 --> 20:44.440
There were deeper secrets to learn there...

20:44.610 --> 20:46.150
but I didn't have the strength to receive them.

20:46.450 --> 20:49.240
I chose to settle for my miracle and I came back home.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.710
The place you're looking for is called Kamar-Taj.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.120
But the cost there is high.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.120
How much?

21:01.210 --> 21:02.870
I'm not talking about money.

21:05.010 --> 21:06.340
Good luck.

21:08.220 --> 21:10.630
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

21:31.540 --> 21:32.870
Uh, Kamar-Taj?

21:33.120 --> 21:35.610
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

21:59.480 --> 22:01.060
Kamar-Taj?

22:02.070 --> 22:03.900
Kamar-Taj.

22:32.260 --> 22:33.470
Okay.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.090
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

22:38.810 --> 22:39.850
Your watch.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.140
No, please. it's all I have left.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.350
Your watch.

22:47.740 --> 22:48.940
All right.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.310
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.180
Really?

24:03.850 --> 24:05.260
Sure we got the right place?

24:06.020 --> 24:09.520
That one looks a little more Kamar-Tajey.

24:11.490 --> 24:14.070
I once stood in your place.

24:14.870 --> 24:18.650
And I, too, was disrespectful.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.030
So, might I offer you some advice?

24:23.040 --> 24:25.410
Forget everything you think you know.

24:27.710 --> 24:29.420
All right.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.010
The sanctuary of our teacher.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.220
The Ancient One.

24:42.770 --> 24:44.180
The Ancient One?

24:44.270 --> 24:45.380
What's his real name?

24:47.110 --> 24:48.100
Right.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.730
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

25:01.790 --> 25:03.280
Urn, thank you for... Whoa!

25:05.580 --> 25:07.620
Okay, thats a thing.

25:08.630 --> 25:09.910
Thank you for...

25:10.130 --> 25:11.120
Hello.

25:12.050 --> 25:13.460
Oh, thank you.

25:14.090 --> 25:15.420
And thank you.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.550
Uh, thank you...

25:17.720 --> 25:20.430
Ancient One, for seeing me.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.590
You're very welcome.

25:25.270 --> 25:26.300
The Ancient One.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.310
Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.060
Mr. Strange.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.310
Uh... Doctor, actually.

25:33.610 --> 25:35.940
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

25:36.110 --> 25:37.190
Isn't that why you're here?

25:37.990 --> 25:39.780
You've undergone many procedures.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.110
Seven, right?

25:41.320 --> 25:42.200
Yeah.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.940
it's good tea.

25:45.290 --> 25:46.280
Yes.

25:50.250 --> 25:53.290
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

25:53.510 --> 25:54.490
A paralyzed man?

25:54.630 --> 25:55.670
In a way.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.750
You helped him to walk again.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.960
Yes.

25:59.140 --> 26:02.670
How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

26:02.850 --> 26:04.630
Well, I didn't correct it.

26:04.770 --> 26:07.600
He couldn't walk. I convinced him that he could.

26:07.850 --> 26:09.680
Youre not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

26:09.770 --> 26:11.730
When you reattach a severed nerve...

26:11.980 --> 26:14.270
is it you who heals it back together or the body?

26:14.360 --> 26:15.350
it's the cells.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.020
The cells are only programmed...

26:17.110 --> 26:19.150
to put themselves back together in very specific ways.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.240
Right.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.820
What if I told you that your own body could be convinced...

26:23.040 --> 26:26.150
to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

26:27.160 --> 26:30.330
Youre talking about cellular regeneration.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.660
Thats bleeding edge medical tech.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.670
Is that why youre working here?

26:34.880 --> 26:37.040
Without a governing medical board?

26:37.510 --> 26:39.090
Just how experimental is your treatment?

26:40.050 --> 26:41.170
Quite.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.970
So, youve figured out a way...

26:44.060 --> 26:46.340
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

26:47.350 --> 26:48.890
No, Mr. Strange.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.390
I know how to reorient the spirit...

26:52.560 --> 26:54.180
to better heal the body.

26:56.030 --> 26:57.730
The spirit to heal the body?

26:57.730 --> 26:58.690
That's right.

27:01.070 --> 27:02.810
No. All right.

27:02.990 --> 27:03.980
How do we do that?

27:04.200 --> 27:05.660
Where do we start?

27:11.210 --> 27:13.160
- Don't like that map? - Oh, no.

27:13.380 --> 27:16.410
it's really good. It's just, I've seen it before...

27:16.550 --> 27:17.790
in gift shops.

27:19.760 --> 27:20.920
And what about this one?

27:21.590 --> 27:23.550
- Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

27:25.640 --> 27:26.670
What about that one?

27:26.890 --> 27:29.550
Showing me an MRI scan. I do not believe this.

27:29.890 --> 27:32.230
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone...

27:32.400 --> 27:35.010
who could see in part, but not the whole.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.520
I spent my last dollar getting here, one- way ticket...

27:37.610 --> 27:40.820
and you're talking to me about healing through belief?

27:41.070 --> 27:43.400
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.940
You've spent your whole life

27:45.280 --> 27:46.360
trying to widen that keyhole...

27:46.450 --> 27:48.070
to see more, to know more.

27:48.540 --> 27:51.240
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

27:51.540 --> 27:53.250
in ways you can't imagine...

27:53.420 --> 27:54.910
you reject the possibility.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.500
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales...

27:57.590 --> 27:59.250
about chakras or energy...

27:59.510 --> 28:01.000
or the power of belief.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.170
There is no such thing as spirit!

28:03.930 --> 28:06.790
We are made of matter and nothing more.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.130
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

28:10.270 --> 28:11.550
within an indifferent universe.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.260
You think too little of yourself.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.470
Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

28:15.560 --> 28:16.640
Well, you don't.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.600
But I see through you!

28:37.290 --> 28:38.700
What did you just do to me?

28:38.920 --> 28:40.960
I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

28:41.170 --> 28:42.660
What's in that tea?

28:42.760 --> 28:44.460
Psilocybin? LSD?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.250
It's just tea...

28:46.350 --> 28:47.380
with a little honey.

28:48.010 --> 28:49.170
What just happened?

28:49.350 --> 28:51.680
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

28:51.770 --> 28:52.760
The what?

28:52.980 --> 28:55.890
A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.890
Why are you doing this to me?

28:58.070 --> 29:00.480
To show you just how much you don't know.

29:01.530 --> 29:02.610
Open your eye.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.940
Oh, shit!

29:10.120 --> 29:12.480
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

29:12.660 --> 29:14.030
No, no, no!

29:14.210 --> 29:15.200
What's happening?

29:15.370 --> 29:17.460
This isnt real!

29:29.050 --> 29:31.010
His heart rate is getting dangerously high.

29:36.310 --> 29:37.350
He looks all right to me.

29:39.900 --> 29:42.690
You think you know how the world works?

29:42.860 --> 29:46.070
You think that this material universe is all there is?

29:51.030 --> 29:52.870
What is real?

29:54.500 --> 29:57.580
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?

30:00.380 --> 30:02.080
At the root of existence...

30:02.250 --> 30:05.340
mind and matter meet.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.370
Thou ghts shape reality.

30:16.230 --> 30:17.760
Oh!

30:21.520 --> 30:24.980
This universe is only one of an infinite number.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.730
Worlds without end.

30:30.570 --> 30:32.940
Some benevolent and life giving.

30:35.910 --> 30:39.580
Others filled with malice and hunger.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.450
Dark places...

30:43.630 --> 30:48.420
where powers older than time lie ravenous...

30:50.180 --> 30:51.340
and waiting.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.620
Who are you

31:00.620 --> 31:03.700
in this vast Multiverse,

31:03.700 --> 31:05.190
Mr. Strange?

31:25.250 --> 31:28.370
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

31:35.310 --> 31:36.590
Teach me.

31:39.310 --> 31:40.340
No.

31:46.150 --> 31:47.180
No.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.260
No!

31:48.440 --> 31:50.480
No, no, no!

31:52.660 --> 31:53.740
No!

31:53.820 --> 31:56.110
Open the door! Please!

31:59.450 --> 32:01.660
Thank you, Masters.

32:05.540 --> 32:08.130
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

32:08.300 --> 32:10.580
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.380
There's a strength to him.

32:13.550 --> 32:16.170
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.920
I've seen it all before.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.140
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

32:21.230 --> 32:24.060
I cannot lead another gifted student to power...

32:24.150 --> 32:26.390
only to lose him to the darkness.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.850
You didn't lose me.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.520
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

32:32.610 --> 32:36.230
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

32:36.410 --> 32:39.280
And to live within the natural law.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.570
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.700
We only learn to live above them.

32:47.290 --> 32:50.160
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.620
If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin...

32:52.720 --> 32:54.130
upon us all.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.970
There may be dark days ahead.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.840
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.770
Don't shut me out.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.650
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.570
Thank you.

33:28.920 --> 33:29.950
Bathe.

33:31.090 --> 33:32.290
Rest.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.620
Meditate...

33:34.800 --> 33:36.630
if you can.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.840
The Ancient One will send for you.

33:46.270 --> 33:47.930
Whats this? My mantra?

33:50.610 --> 33:52.270
The Wi-Fi password.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.480
Were not savages.

34:26.810 --> 34:28.970
The language of the mystic arts..

34:29.150 --> 34:31.640
is as old as civilization.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.180
The sorcerers of antiquity...

34:34.320 --> 34:37.150
called the use of this language 'spells.'

34:37.320 --> 34:39.230
But if that word offends your modern sensibilities...

34:39.410 --> 34:41.900
you can call it a 'program.'

34:42.370 --> 34:45.070
The source code that shapes reality.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.030
We harness energy...

34:49.370 --> 34:52.660
drawn from other dimensions of the Multiverse...

34:54.000 --> 34:55.740
to cast spells...

34:57.380 --> 34:59.960
to conjure shields...

35:00.180 --> 35:02.010
and weapons...

35:03.010 --> 35:04.170
to make magic.

35:17.570 --> 35:22.060
But even if my fingers could do that...

35:23.030 --> 35:25.820
my hands would just be waving in the air.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.070
How do I get from here to there?

35:28.370 --> 35:31.700
How did you get to reattach severed nerves...

35:31.790 --> 35:34.370
and put a human spine back together bone by bone?

35:34.630 --> 35:36.960
Study and practice, years of it.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.540
Hey.

35:50.270 --> 35:51.600
Mr. Strange.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.640
Uh, Stephen, please.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.890
- And you are? - Wong.

35:56.150 --> 35:57.230
Wang.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.140
Just Wong?

35:59.320 --> 36:00.980
Like Adele?

36:02.950 --> 36:04.560
Or Aristotle.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.320
Drake.

36:07.740 --> 36:08.780
Bono.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.240
Eminem.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.490
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.910
Astronomia Nova.

36:21.090 --> 36:22.630
Codex Imperium.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.630
Key of Solomon.

36:26.930 --> 36:28.220
You finished all of these?

36:28.560 --> 36:29.550
Yup.

36:30.270 --> 36:31.300
Come with me.

36:31.430 --> 36:32.510
All right.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.470
This section is for masters only...

36:35.650 --> 36:38.010
but at my discretion, others may use it.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.610
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

36:44.780 --> 36:46.020
Hows your Sanskrit?

36:47.120 --> 36:50.110
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

36:50.450 --> 36:52.990
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

36:57.000 --> 36:57.990
What are those?

36:59.300 --> 37:01.750
The Ancient Ones private collection.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.130
So, theyre forbidden?

37:03.590 --> 37:05.800
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

37:05.970 --> 37:07.760
Only certain practices.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.590
Those books are far too advanced

37:10.680 --> 37:12.760
for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.820
This ones got pages missing.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.270
Thats The Book of Cagliostro.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.110
A study of time.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.070
One of the rituals was stolen by a former master.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.870
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.910
Just after he strung up the former librarian...

37:42.210 --> 37:44.500
and relieved him of his head.

37:47.180 --> 37:49.040
I am now the guardian of these books.

37:49.550 --> 37:52.840
So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again...

37:53.180 --> 37:54.340
I'd know it...

37:54.810 --> 37:57.720
and you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.520
What if it's just overdue?

38:03.860 --> 38:05.850
Any late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps?

38:10.660 --> 38:12.520
People used to think that I was funny.

38:12.830 --> 38:13.910
Did they work for you?

38:14.250 --> 38:16.200
All right. Well, it's been lovely talking to you.

38:16.540 --> 38:18.120
Thank you for the books...

38:18.210 --> 38:20.420
and for the horrifying story...

38:20.500 --> 38:22.330
and for the threat upon my life.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.410
We will now receive the power

38:55.540 --> 38:57.400
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.080
The one who betrays the world.

40:01.480 --> 40:05.270
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.930
They allow us to travel throughout the Multiverse.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.480
All you need to do is focus.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.530
Visualize.

40:13.030 --> 40:15.940
See the destination in your mind.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.110
Look beyond the world in front of you.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.120
Imagine every detail.

40:23.420 --> 40:27.380
The clearer the picture, the quicker and easier...

40:28.000 --> 40:29.840
the gateway will come.

40:33.430 --> 40:34.590
And stop.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.290
I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.

40:38.010 --> 40:39.090
Of course.

40:43.270 --> 40:44.510
My hands.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.760
it's not about your hands.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.980
How is this not about my hands?

40:48.650 --> 40:49.640
Master Hamir.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.450
Thank you, Master Hamir.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.580
You cannot beat a river into submission.

41:09.710 --> 41:11.620
You have to surrender to it's current...

41:11.800 --> 41:14.040
and use it's power as your own.

41:14.220 --> 41:16.380
I control it by surrendering control?

41:16.470 --> 41:17.880
That doesn't make any sense.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.420
Not everything does. Not everything has to.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.670
Your intellect has taken you far in life...

41:23.850 --> 41:25.310
but it will take you no further.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.800
Surrender, Stephen.

41:28.270 --> 41:30.010
Silence your ego...

41:30.320 --> 41:32.180
and your power will rise.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.230
Come with me.

41:39.370 --> 41:40.450
Wait.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.490
- Is this... - Everest.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.120
Beautiful.

41:45.210 --> 41:47.740
Yeah, right, beautiful.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.330
Freezing but beautiful.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.580
At this temperature...

41:51.880 --> 41:54.000
a person can last for 30 minutes...

41:54.090 --> 41:56.670
before suffering permanent loss of function.

41:56.930 --> 41:57.920
Great.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.470
But you'll likely go into shock within the first two.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.880
- What? - Surrender, Stephen.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.090
No!

42:14.940 --> 42:15.930
How's our new recruit?

42:16.700 --> 42:18.230
We shall see.

42:19.030 --> 42:20.740
Any second now.

42:22.910 --> 42:24.120
Oh, no, not again.

42:29.460 --> 42:30.450
Maybe I should...

43:44.660 --> 43:45.690
Stephen.

43:45.950 --> 43:46.940
Wang.

43:47.040 --> 43:47.990
What do you want, Strange?

43:48.080 --> 43:49.490
Books on astral projection.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.580
You're not ready for that.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.460
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

43:58.550 --> 43:59.910
She's a huge star, right?

44:02.680 --> 44:03.880
Do you ever laugh?

44:05.140 --> 44:06.750
Oh, come on, just give me the book.

44:07.810 --> 44:08.890
No.

44:36.250 --> 44:37.990
Once, in this room,

44:38.090 --> 44:40.420
you begged me to let you learn.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.420
Now, I'm told you question every lesson...

44:43.510 --> 44:45.090
preferring to teach yourself.

44:45.390 --> 44:47.090
Once, in this room, you told me to open my eye.

44:47.180 --> 44:49.090
Now, I'm being told to blindly accept rules...

44:49.310 --> 44:50.590
that make no sense.

44:50.930 --> 44:53.720
Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

44:53.980 --> 44:55.340
Wong told on me?

44:55.610 --> 44:58.020
You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

44:58.110 --> 45:00.770
You need a safe space to practice your spells.

45:19.250 --> 45:21.240
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension...

45:21.590 --> 45:24.080
ever present but undetected.

45:24.300 --> 45:26.290
The real world isn't affected by what happens here.

45:28.260 --> 45:31.430
We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil...

45:32.230 --> 45:34.560
and sometimes to contain threats.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.730
You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.

45:36.980 --> 45:39.690
Hold on. Sorry. What do you mean, "threats?"

45:49.620 --> 45:53.450
Learning of an infinite Multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers.

45:54.290 --> 45:56.750
If I told you everything else that you don't already know...

45:56.830 --> 45:58.370
you'd run from here in terror.

46:04.420 --> 46:06.840
So just how ancient is she?

46:09.180 --> 46:11.540
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.510
Only that she's Celtic and never talks about her past.

46:15.690 --> 46:17.520
You follow her, even though you don't know?

46:17.600 --> 46:20.260
I know shes steadfast... but unpredictable.

46:20.440 --> 46:21.720
Merciless, yet kind.

46:23.900 --> 46:25.360
She made me what I am.

46:27.030 --> 46:28.360
Trust your teacher...

46:29.200 --> 46:30.230
and don't lose your way.

46:30.530 --> 46:31.520
Like Kaecilius?

46:31.950 --> 46:32.940
Thats right.

46:37.670 --> 46:38.910
You knew him.

46:40.170 --> 46:41.160
When he first came to us...

46:41.960 --> 46:43.540
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

46:43.880 --> 46:47.540
He was a grieving, broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts.

46:47.630 --> 46:51.550
A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.

46:51.640 --> 46:53.590
He questioned the Ancient One, rejected her teaching.

47:01.310 --> 47:03.150
He left Kamar-Taj.

47:03.230 --> 47:05.770
His disciples followed him like sheep.

47:05.860 --> 47:07.820
Seduced by false doctrine.

47:07.900 --> 47:10.320
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

47:10.410 --> 47:11.400
Yes.

47:11.570 --> 47:12.730
What did it do?

47:15.080 --> 47:16.410
No more questions.

47:17.910 --> 47:18.990
What's that?

47:19.080 --> 47:20.320
That's a question.

47:22.080 --> 47:23.920
This is a relic.

47:24.090 --> 47:25.920
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

47:26.090 --> 47:27.080
so we imbue objects with it...

47:28.340 --> 47:30.550
allowing them to take the strain we cannot.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.590
This is the staff...

47:33.800 --> 47:35.390
of the Living Tribunal.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.300
There are many relics.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.260
The Wand of Watoomb.

47:42.610 --> 47:44.890
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

47:45.150 --> 47:46.890
Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?

47:47.860 --> 47:49.600
- When do I get my relic? - When you're ready.

47:50.070 --> 47:51.110
I think I'm ready.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.950
You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.

47:54.620 --> 47:55.860
For now...

47:56.870 --> 47:57.860
conjure a weapon.

47:59.620 --> 48:00.610
All right.

48:07.050 --> 48:08.130
Fight!

48:09.300 --> 48:10.750
Fight like your life depended on it.

48:16.970 --> 48:18.340
Because one day...

48:18.640 --> 48:19.850
it may.

49:30.210 --> 49:31.200
Wong?

49:43.890 --> 49:44.880
Okay.

49:45.560 --> 49:49.100
'First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

50:09.290 --> 50:10.500
All right.

50:33.820 --> 50:35.150
Oh, my.

50:49.710 --> 50:50.790
What if...

51:12.690 --> 51:14.060
'Dormammu.'

51:15.820 --> 51:16.980
'The Dark Dimension.'

51:17.950 --> 51:19.400
Eternal life?

51:24.990 --> 51:26.700
- What the... - Stop!

51:30.870 --> 51:33.160
Tampering with continuum probabilities is forbidden.

51:33.420 --> 51:35.790
I was just doing exactly what it said in the book.

51:36.090 --> 51:37.200
What did the book say

51:37.300 --> 51:38.660
about the dangers of performing that ritual?

51:38.880 --> 51:40.460
I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

51:40.550 --> 51:43.540
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.960
Unstable dimensional openings.

51:46.140 --> 51:48.350
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

51:48.520 --> 51:50.470
You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment

51:50.770 --> 51:51.850
over and over forever...

51:51.940 --> 51:53.270
or never having existed at all?

51:54.690 --> 51:56.930
Really should put the warnings before the spell.

51:57.030 --> 51:58.980
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.390
You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum...

52:01.490 --> 52:02.480
you were breaking it.

52:03.910 --> 52:05.860
We do not tamper with natural law.

52:05.950 --> 52:06.940
We defend it.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.490
How did you even do that?

52:08.830 --> 52:09.860
Hmm?

52:10.160 --> 52:12.030
Where did you learn the litany of spells required to

52:12.030 --> 52:13.030
even understand it?

52:13.290 --> 52:14.280
I've got a photographic memory.

52:14.380 --> 52:16.160
That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

52:16.460 --> 52:17.870
What you just did...

52:18.630 --> 52:20.290
takes more than a good memory.

52:20.590 --> 52:22.300
You were born for the mystic arts.

52:22.380 --> 52:24.550
And yet my hands still shake.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.920
For now, yes.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.220
Not forever?

52:27.470 --> 52:28.510
Were not prophets.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.390
When are you gonna start telling me what we are?

52:35.810 --> 52:37.480
While heroes like the Avengers

52:37.570 --> 52:39.850
protect the world from physical dangers...

52:39.940 --> 52:43.400
we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.

52:44.490 --> 52:46.950
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line

52:47.080 --> 52:48.190
of Sorcerers Supreme...

52:48.740 --> 52:52.080
going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts...

52:52.250 --> 52:53.360
the mighty Agamotto.

52:54.420 --> 52:58.500
Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.500
Agamotto built three Sanctums in places of power...

53:03.590 --> 53:05.670
where great cities now stand.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.920
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.550
That door to the New York Sanctum.

53:11.270 --> 53:12.470
That one to the London Sanctum.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.640
Together...

53:14.940 --> 53:18.350
the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.

53:18.770 --> 53:20.510
The Sanctums protect the world...

53:20.610 --> 53:21.940
and we sorcerers...

53:22.610 --> 53:23.850
protect the Sanctums.

53:24.110 --> 53:25.980
From what?

53:26.280 --> 53:28.770
Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe.

53:29.490 --> 53:30.610
Like Dormammu.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.490
Where did you learn that name?

53:34.210 --> 53:37.370
Ijust read itin The Book of Cagliostro. Why?

53:42.590 --> 53:45.130
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

53:46.300 --> 53:47.290
Beyond time.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.130
He is the cosmic conqueror...

53:50.220 --> 53:52.130
the destroyer of worlds.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.970
A being of infinite power and endless hunger...

53:56.060 --> 53:58.470
on a quest to invade every universe...

53:58.560 --> 54:01.270
and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.

54:02.690 --> 54:05.150
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.490
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

54:08.990 --> 54:11.070
A ritual to contact Dormammu

54:11.160 --> 54:12.650
and draw power from the Dark Dimension.

54:16.170 --> 54:18.700
Uh... Okay...

54:19.500 --> 54:21.290
Urn... I'rn out.

54:22.170 --> 54:24.660
I carne here to heal rny hands.

54:25.420 --> 54:28.710
Not to fight in some mystical war.

54:30.930 --> 54:32.010
London.

54:36.850 --> 54:37.840
Kaecilius!

54:38.150 --> 54:39.130
No!

54:45.400 --> 54:47.230
Wong? Mordo?

55:38.210 --> 55:39.240
Hello?

56:08.610 --> 56:09.600
Hello?

56:48.320 --> 56:51.940
Daniel, I see they made you master of this Sanctum.

56:53.030 --> 56:55.150
You know what that means?

56:55.660 --> 56:57.320
That you'll die protecting it.

57:13.340 --> 57:14.550
Stop!

57:25.900 --> 57:28.230
How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

57:28.520 --> 57:29.640
Doctor.

57:31.110 --> 57:32.100
Mister Doctor?

57:32.650 --> 57:34.190
It's Strange.

57:35.820 --> 57:38.190
Maybe. Who am Ito judge?

1:00:03.350 --> 1:00:05.300
You don't know how to use that, do you?

1:01:50.450 --> 1:01:51.910
What?

1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.290
Oh, stop it.

1:01:58.420 --> 1:01:59.410
I said stop it.

1:01:59.630 --> 1:02:00.960
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

1:02:01.250 --> 1:02:03.590
I don't even know what 'this' is.

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:04.790
It's the end...

1:02:05.130 --> 1:02:06.790
and the beginning.

1:02:06.970 --> 1:02:09.710
The many becoming the few becoming the One.

1:02:11.430 --> 1:02:12.890
If youre not gonna start making sense...

1:02:12.970 --> 1:02:14.640
I'm just gonna to have to put this thing back on.

1:02:14.810 --> 1:02:15.840
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:19.310
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

1:02:19.610 --> 1:02:21.140
- You are a doctor? - Yeah.

1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:22.310
A scientist.

1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:24.470
You understand the laws of nature.

1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:27.940
All things age. All things die.

1:02:28.030 --> 1:02:29.570
In the end, our sun burns out.

1:02:29.660 --> 1:02:31.900
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:33.780
But the Dark Dimension...

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.620
it's a place beyond time.

1:02:36.870 --> 1:02:38.360
Thats it. I'm putting this thing back on.

1:02:38.460 --> 1:02:39.870
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

1:02:40.130 --> 1:02:42.710
This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others...

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:44.120
as part of the One.

1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:46.670
The great and beautiful One.

1:02:47.470 --> 1:02:49.170
We can all live forever.

1:02:49.510 --> 1:02:50.670
Really?

1:02:52.890 --> 1:02:55.930
What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

1:02:57.020 --> 1:02:58.010
The same as you.

1:02:58.270 --> 1:03:01.010
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

1:03:01.610 --> 1:03:03.520
People think in terms of good and evil...

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.520
when really time is the true enemy of us all.

1:03:05.610 --> 1:03:07.320
Time kills everything.

1:03:07.570 --> 1:03:09.150
What about the people you killed?

1:03:09.450 --> 1:03:10.530
Tiny.

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:13.070
Momentary specks within an indifferent universe.

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:17.070
Yes. You see.

1:03:17.910 --> 1:03:19.910
You see what we're doing.

1:03:20.540 --> 1:03:22.280
The world is not what it ought to be.

1:03:22.380 --> 1:03:24.870
Humanity longs for the eternal...

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:27.670
for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:30.000
Time is an insult.

1:03:30.090 --> 1:03:31.710
Death is an insult.

1:03:33.140 --> 1:03:34.380
Doctor...

1:03:35.390 --> 1:03:37.850
we don't seek to rule this world.

1:03:37.930 --> 1:03:39.170
We seek to save it...

1:03:39.270 --> 1:03:40.800
to hand it over to Dormammu,

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.760
who is the intent of all evolution...

1:03:43.770 --> 1:03:45.600
the why of all existence.

1:03:46.610 --> 1:03:49.520
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:53.320
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:54.820
Was it enlightenment?

1:03:55.620 --> 1:03:56.820
Power?

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:01.080
You came to be healed, as did we all.

1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:05.410
Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things.

1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:07.490
We all come with the promise of being healed...

1:04:07.590 --> 1:04:10.420
and instead The Ancient One gives us parlor tricks.

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.260
The real magic she keeps for herself.

1:04:14.350 --> 1:04:17.680
You ever wonder how she managed to live this long?

1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:25.270
I saw the rituals in The Book of Cagliostro.

1:04:25.610 --> 1:04:27.770
So, you know.

1:04:28.110 --> 1:04:29.690
The ritual gives me the power

1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:31.110
to overthrow The Ancient One...

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:32.940
and tear her Sanctums down.

1:04:33.030 --> 1:04:35.690
To let the Dark Dimension in.

1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:37.780
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:39.490
Dormammu gives freely.

1:04:40.330 --> 1:04:41.820
Life everlasting.

1:04:42.620 --> 1:04:44.960
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:46.950
He's the savior of worlds.

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.240
No. I mean, come on.

1:04:49.340 --> 1:04:51.170
Look at your face.

1:04:51.630 --> 1:04:53.720
Dormammu made you a murderer.

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:56.010
Just how good can his kingdom be?

1:04:57.970 --> 1:04:59.510
You think thats funny?

1:04:59.970 --> 1:05:01.640
No, not that.

1:05:01.810 --> 1:05:04.220
What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.

1:06:12.590 --> 1:06:13.670
Sir, can I help you?

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:14.960
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

1:06:15.130 --> 1:06:16.620
- Sir. We need to get... - Where is she?

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:18.210
The nurses station.

1:06:18.300 --> 1:06:19.380
Christine!

1:06:21.390 --> 1:06:22.550
Stephen?

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:23.720
Oh, my God.

1:06:23.810 --> 1:06:26.390
Get me in an operating theater now. Just you.

1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:27.590
Now I haven't any time.

1:06:28.230 --> 1:06:29.310
What happened?

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:32.360
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:34.890
What are you wearing?

1:06:41.580 --> 1:06:42.530
Chest cavity is clear.

1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:45.360
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

1:06:48.330 --> 1:06:49.490
No, no, no.

1:06:49.580 --> 1:06:50.570
Stephen?

1:06:52.170 --> 1:06:53.380
Come on, come on.

1:07:19.110 --> 1:07:21.320
Just a little higher.

1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:23.780
Please be careful with the needle.

1:07:25.870 --> 1:07:26.860
Stephen?

1:07:29.620 --> 1:07:30.610
What am I seeing?

1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:32.660
My astral body.

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:34.950
Are you dead?

1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:36.840
No, Christine. But I am dying.

1:07:39.050 --> 1:07:40.920
Right.

1:07:42.390 --> 1:07:43.380
Yeah. All right.

1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:45.130
Okay.

1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:50.390
Oh, wow.

1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:56.860
I've never seen a wound like this.

1:07:57.400 --> 1:07:58.810
What were you stabbed with?

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:00.570
I don't know.

1:08:20.430 --> 1:08:22.090
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:23.550
What?

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.170
Keep me alive, will you?

1:08:28.270 --> 1:08:30.300
Okay.

1:08:54.750 --> 1:08:55.830
Oh, shit.

1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:34.660
Come on, come on.

1:09:39.670 --> 1:09:40.830
Stephen, come on.

1:09:43.550 --> 1:09:44.960
Hit me again.

1:09:45.050 --> 1:09:46.630
Stop doing that!

1:09:46.930 --> 1:09:48.590
Up the voltage and hit me again.

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:49.720
No, your hearts beating!

1:09:49.890 --> 1:09:51.130
Just do it!

1:09:51.890 --> 1:09:53.630
Oh, my God.

1:10:22.710 --> 1:10:24.710
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:25.960
Are you okay?

1:10:26.050 --> 1:10:27.130
Yeah.

1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:28.300
Okay.

1:10:34.770 --> 1:10:36.800
After all this time...

1:10:36.980 --> 1:10:38.760
you just show up here...

1:10:40.310 --> 1:10:42.400
flying out of your body.

1:10:42.570 --> 1:10:44.270
Yeah, I know.

1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:45.980
I missed you, too, by the way.

1:10:48.030 --> 1:10:50.650
I wrote you emails, but you never responded.

1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:51.980
Why would I?

1:10:52.910 --> 1:10:55.200
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

1:10:56.290 --> 1:10:58.120
For all of it. You were right.

1:10:58.330 --> 1:11:01.920
I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly.

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.420
And you deserved so much more.

1:11:04.670 --> 1:11:06.040
Stop. Youre clearly in shock.

1:11:07.970 --> 1:11:10.300
What the hell is happening?

1:11:10.470 --> 1:11:11.760
Where have you been?

1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:15.840
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

1:11:15.930 --> 1:11:18.890
I headed east, and I ended up in Kathmandu.

1:11:19.190 --> 1:11:20.140
Kathmandu?

1:11:20.230 --> 1:11:21.510
Yeah.

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:23.680
Like the Bob Seger song?

1:11:24.030 --> 1:11:25.770
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

1:11:26.030 --> 1:11:29.650
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

1:11:29.820 --> 1:11:33.490
and I talked to someone called The Ancient One.'

1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:35.610
Oh. So you joined a cult.

1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:38.290
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:41.210
They did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.

1:11:41.330 --> 1:11:42.620
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:44.040
It's not a cult.

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:45.540
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:46.790
Oh, no.

1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:49.840
Wait. Stephen, wait. What do you think youre doing?

1:11:50.090 --> 1:11:51.710
I'm late for a cult meeting.

1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:56.600
This is insane.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:57.760
Yeah.

1:11:57.850 --> 1:11:59.840
- Where are you going? - Urn...

1:12:00.390 --> 1:12:01.800
Can you tell me the truth?

1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:04.470
Well, a powerful sorcerer

1:12:04.570 --> 1:12:06.270
who gave himself over to an ancient entity...

1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:08.980
can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me.

1:12:09.070 --> 1:12:10.860
But I left him chained up in Greenwich Village...

1:12:10.950 --> 1:12:13.310
and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway...

1:12:13.530 --> 1:12:14.610
that I opened up in the mop closet.

1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:16.570
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

1:12:27.130 --> 1:12:28.710
Really do have to go.

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:17.750
Strange!

1:13:20.270 --> 1:13:21.510
You're okay.

1:13:21.770 --> 1:13:23.850
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

1:13:24.650 --> 1:13:26.390
The Cloak of Levitation.

1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:28.900
It came to you.

1:13:29.690 --> 1:13:31.100
No minor feat.

1:13:32.070 --> 1:13:33.480
it's a fickle thing.

1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:35.650
- Hes escaped. - Kaecilius?

1:13:35.950 --> 1:13:36.940
Yeah.

1:13:37.530 --> 1:13:39.740
He can fold space and matter at will.

1:13:39.990 --> 1:13:43.360
He folds matter outside the Mirror Dimension...

1:13:43.540 --> 1:13:44.620
in the real world?

1:13:44.830 --> 1:13:45.820
Yeah.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.790
- How many more? - Two.

1:13:48.670 --> 1:13:50.880
I stranded one in the desert.

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.040
And the other?

1:13:52.130 --> 1:13:53.590
His body's in the hail.

1:13:53.670 --> 1:13:55.460
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:57.330
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

1:13:57.430 --> 1:13:58.840
The London Sanctum has fallen.

1:13:59.100 --> 1:14:01.340
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now...

1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:03.590
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

1:14:04.390 --> 1:14:07.230
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:09.220
With its master gone, it needs another.

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:10.890
Master Strange.

1:14:13.780 --> 1:14:14.770
No.

1:14:15.990 --> 1:14:17.980
It is Doctor Strange.

1:14:18.070 --> 1:14:20.780
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

1:14:20.870 --> 1:14:22.030
Doctor Strange.

1:14:23.450 --> 1:14:26.910
When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm.

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.330
And I have just killed a man!

1:14:28.420 --> 1:14:30.250
I'm not doing that again.

1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:32.790
I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

1:14:33.050 --> 1:14:36.210
You became a doctor to save one life above all others.

1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:37.290
Your own.

1:14:38.890 --> 1:14:40.550
Still seeing through me, are you?

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:42.740
I see what I've always seen:

1:14:42.740 --> 1:14:44.380
your over-inflated ego.

1:14:44.930 --> 1:14:48.100
You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything...

1:14:48.270 --> 1:14:49.600
even death...

1:14:49.810 --> 1:14:51.400
which no one can control.

1:14:51.570 --> 1:14:54.230
Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange.

1:14:54.490 --> 1:14:56.570
Not even Dormammu?

1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:00.070
He offers immortality.

1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:02.230
it's our fear of death that gives Dormammu life.

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:03.620
He feeds off it.

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:06.040
Like you feed off him?

1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:07.950
You talk to me about controlling death?

1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:09.120
Oh, I know how you do it.

1:15:09.210 --> 1:15:12.000
I've seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro.

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:15.910
Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

1:15:16.170 --> 1:15:17.880
Because you might not like them?

1:15:18.220 --> 1:15:21.000
Because you may not know of what you speak.

1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:22.750
What is he talking about?

1:15:22.930 --> 1:15:26.220
I'm talking about her long life, the source of her immortality.

1:15:27.810 --> 1:15:29.640
She draws power from the Dark Dimension

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.260
to stay alive.

1:15:33.230 --> 1:15:34.350
Thats not true.

1:15:34.610 --> 1:15:36.720
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

1:15:37.650 --> 1:15:39.020
I know how you do it.

1:15:40.740 --> 1:15:42.150
Once they regroup...

1:15:42.410 --> 1:15:43.900
the Zealots will be back.

1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:46.450
You'll need reinforcements.

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.410
She's not who you think she is.

1:15:55.630 --> 1:15:57.460
You don't have the right to say that.

1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:00.300
You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

1:16:00.380 --> 1:16:02.300
No, and I don't want to know.

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:03.760
You're a coward.

1:16:04.140 --> 1:16:05.170
Because I'm not a killer?

1:16:05.430 --> 1:16:06.920
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:09.600
and you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?

1:16:09.810 --> 1:16:11.100
What do you think I just did?

1:16:11.310 --> 1:16:12.520
You saved your own life!

1:16:13.900 --> 1:16:16.440
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

1:16:16.650 --> 1:16:17.890
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

1:16:18.150 --> 1:16:20.810
You've no idea the things I've done.

1:16:22.990 --> 1:16:24.860
And the answer is yes.

1:16:24.950 --> 1:16:26.660
Without hesitation.

1:16:26.910 --> 1:16:27.990
Even if theres another way?

1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:29.990
There is no other way.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:31.450
You lack imagination.

1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:32.620
No, Stephen.

1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:36.330
You lack a spine.

1:16:41.470 --> 1:16:42.670
They're back.

1:16:49.430 --> 1:16:50.760
We have to end this.

1:16:50.980 --> 1:16:52.060
Now!

1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:58.390
Strange!

1:16:58.650 --> 1:17:00.230
Get down here and fight!

1:17:00.570 --> 1:17:01.650
No!

1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:07.360
The Mirror Dimension.

1:17:07.990 --> 1:17:10.360
You can't affect the real world in here.

1:17:10.870 --> 1:17:12.160
Whos laughing now?

1:17:12.370 --> 1:17:13.490
Asshole.

1:17:15.380 --> 1:17:16.410
I am.

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:31.680
I've got his sling ring.

1:17:31.770 --> 1:17:32.760
They can't escape, right?

1:17:34.190 --> 1:17:35.270
Run!

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:54.080
Their connection to the Dark Dimension

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:56.080
makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

1:17:56.170 --> 1:17:58.500
They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.

1:17:58.590 --> 1:18:01.420
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1:18:18.020 --> 1:18:20.230
That is hilarious.

1:19:06.650 --> 1:19:08.190
This was a mistake.

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:12.620
Oh!

1:20:40.660 --> 1:20:41.780
It's true.

1:20:42.710 --> 1:20:46.080
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

1:20:49.590 --> 1:20:50.630
Kaecilius.

1:20:53.550 --> 1:20:56.260
I came to you broken...

1:20:56.600 --> 1:20:59.260
lost, in need.

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:02.260
Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

1:21:02.770 --> 1:21:04.230
I tried to protect you.

1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:05.720
From the truth?

1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:06.720
From yourself.

1:21:06.980 --> 1:21:09.100
I have a new teacher now.

1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:10.600
Dormammu deceives you.

1:21:11.610 --> 1:21:13.900
You have no idea what he truly is.

1:21:14.110 --> 1:21:17.950
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:19.320
Liar.

1:22:15.090 --> 1:22:16.170
Christine!

1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:18.590
Are you kidding me?

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:20.750
Oh, my God.

1:22:23.310 --> 1:22:25.520
it's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:26.720
- Neurogenic? - Yes.

1:22:30.700 --> 1:22:31.990
Someone get the swabs.

1:22:35.530 --> 1:22:36.520
Nic?

1:22:39.870 --> 1:22:41.530
We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

1:22:43.670 --> 1:22:45.300
She's still dropping.

1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:47.490
Were losing her!

1:22:47.580 --> 1:22:48.820
We need to increase her oxygen!

1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:50.000
I need a crash cart!

1:22:50.090 --> 1:22:51.070
Her pupils have dilated!

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:52.870
No reflexes.

1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:54.330
Were not reading any brain activity.

1:23:06.060 --> 1:23:07.520
What are you doing?

1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:10.220
Come on, youre dying!

1:23:18.860 --> 1:23:21.400
You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.

1:23:21.530 --> 1:23:23.190
Time is relative.

1:23:23.290 --> 1:23:25.570
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1:23:27.500 --> 1:23:29.280
I've spent so many years...

1:23:29.370 --> 1:23:31.080
peering through time...

1:23:31.250 --> 1:23:33.740
looking at this exact moment.

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:35.450
But I can't see past it.

1:23:36.130 --> 1:23:39.670
I've prevented countless, terrible futures.

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:42.340
And after each one, there's always another.

1:23:42.430 --> 1:23:44.800
And they all lead here...

1:23:44.890 --> 1:23:45.880
but never further.

1:23:46.140 --> 1:23:48.100
You think this is where you die.

1:23:49.020 --> 1:23:51.390
You wonder what I see in your future?

1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:52.600
No.

1:23:54.530 --> 1:23:55.980
Yes.

1:23:56.070 --> 1:23:57.600
I never saw your future.

1:23:57.900 --> 1:24:00.240
Only its possibilities.

1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:03.030
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:05.110
You always excelled...

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:07.690
but not because you craved success...

1:24:07.790 --> 1:24:10.250
but because of your fear of failure.

1:24:10.330 --> 1:24:12.070
Thats what made me a great doctor.

1:24:12.290 --> 1:24:14.870
it's precisely what kept you from greatness.

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.040
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1:24:18.130 --> 1:24:19.500
from learning the simplest

1:24:19.590 --> 1:24:21.630
and most significant lesson of all.

1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:22.710
Which is?

1:24:24.970 --> 1:24:27.180
it's not about you.

1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:32.260
When you first came to me...

1:24:32.350 --> 1:24:35.520
you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pang born.

1:24:36.530 --> 1:24:37.810
I didn't.

1:24:39.740 --> 1:24:43.980
He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:45.900
He uses magic to walk?

1:24:45.990 --> 1:24:47.150
Constantly.

1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:49.580
He had a choice...

1:24:50.370 --> 1:24:52.330
to return to his own life...

1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:55.200
or to serve something greater than himself.

1:24:55.290 --> 1:24:57.960
So I could have my hands back again?

1:24:58.050 --> 1:24:59.460
My old life?

1:25:00.130 --> 1:25:01.370
You could.

1:25:02.470 --> 1:25:05.250
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

1:25:06.850 --> 1:25:10.140
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

1:25:10.230 --> 1:25:11.390
But as you well know...

1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:13.840
sometimes one must break the rules...

1:25:13.940 --> 1:25:15.720
in order to serve the greater good.

1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:17.890
Mordo won't see it that way.

1:25:17.980 --> 1:25:20.600
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1:25:20.690 --> 1:25:22.900
forged by the fires of his youth.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:24.900
He needs your flexibility...

1:25:24.990 --> 1:25:27.030
just as you need his strength.

1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:31.820
Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.

1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:33.540
rn not ready.

1:25:35.630 --> 1:25:37.040
No one ever is.

1:25:38.710 --> 1:25:40.870
We don't get to choose our time.

1:25:45.010 --> 1:25:47.220
Death is what gives life meaning.

1:25:48.350 --> 1:25:50.930
To know your days are numbered.

1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:53.050
Your time is short.

1:25:55.020 --> 1:25:57.310
You'd think after all this time, I'd be ready.

1:25:58.270 --> 1:25:59.980
But look at me.

1:26:00.070 --> 1:26:03.060
Stretching one moment out into a thousand...

1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:05.650
just so that I can watch the snow.

1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:45.810
Are you okay?

1:26:53.620 --> 1:26:55.740
I don't understand whats happening.

1:26:55.910 --> 1:26:56.990
I know.

1:26:57.790 --> 1:27:00.660
But I have to go away now.

1:27:05.590 --> 1:27:08.460
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end.

1:27:08.550 --> 1:27:10.210
That it could be a beginning.

1:27:10.430 --> 1:27:11.460
Yeah.

1:27:12.970 --> 1:27:15.680
Because there are other ways to save lives.

1:27:18.810 --> 1:27:20.300
A harder way.

1:27:22.570 --> 1:27:24.810
A weirder way.

1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:26.810
Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.

1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:28.520
Doctor Palmer to the ER.

1:27:32.830 --> 1:27:34.660
I don't want you to go.

1:28:22.750 --> 1:28:23.910
Stop!

1:28:53.820 --> 1:28:55.820
Choose your weapon wisely.

1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:01.320
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1:29:03.580 --> 1:29:04.620
No one.

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:21.770
Kaecilius.

1:29:22.270 --> 1:29:24.430
You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:38.650
She's dead.

1:29:38.740 --> 1:29:39.950
You were right.

1:29:41.200 --> 1:29:43.200
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1:29:44.370 --> 1:29:46.110
She was complicated.

1:29:50.710 --> 1:29:52.120
Complicated?

1:29:55.430 --> 1:29:59.130
The Dark Dimension is volatile. Dangerous.

1:29:59.930 --> 1:30:01.170
What if it overtook her?

1:30:03.230 --> 1:30:05.430
She taught us it was forbidden...

1:30:06.350 --> 1:30:10.220
while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:12.150
She did what she thought was right.

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:13.940
The bill comes due.

1:30:14.860 --> 1:30:16.270
Don't you see?

1:30:17.820 --> 1:30:21.240
Her transgressions led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1:30:21.330 --> 1:30:24.790
Kaecilius was her fault!

1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:26.700
And here we are...

1:30:26.790 --> 1:30:29.030
in the consequence of her deception.

1:30:32.460 --> 1:30:33.750
A world on fire.

1:30:34.010 --> 1:30:36.290
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:38.250
The New York one has been attacked twice.

1:30:38.350 --> 1:30:39.930
You know where theyre going next.

1:30:40.390 --> 1:30:41.470
Hong Kong.

1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:43.840
You told me once to fight like my life depended on it...

1:30:43.930 --> 1:30:44.920
because one day, it might.

1:30:45.140 --> 1:30:46.680
Well, today is that day.

1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:49.890
I cannot defeat them alone.

1:31:07.290 --> 1:31:08.700
The Sanctums already fallen.

1:31:16.590 --> 1:31:18.500
The Dark Dimension.

1:31:20.350 --> 1:31:21.760
Dormammu is coming.

1:31:24.350 --> 1:31:25.380
it's too late.

1:31:25.890 --> 1:31:27.180
Nothing can stop him.

1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:30.810
Not necessarily.

1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:36.220
No.

1:32:17.610 --> 1:32:18.900
The spell's working.

1:32:20.530 --> 1:32:22.650
Weve got a second chance.

1:34:01.300 --> 1:34:03.250
No!

1:34:13.390 --> 1:34:14.880
Wang.

1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:24.940
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:28.610
Well, don't stop now.

1:34:30.330 --> 1:34:31.660
When the Sanctum's restored,

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:32.900
they'll attack it again.

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:34.160
Weve got to defend it.

1:34:34.410 --> 1:34:35.650
Come on!

1:35:03.940 --> 1:35:04.930
Get up, Strange.

1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:06.440
Get up and fight.

1:35:06.950 --> 1:35:08.310
We can finish this.

1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:11.610
You can't fight the inevitable.

1:35:14.910 --> 1:35:16.780
Isn't it beautiful?

1:35:18.290 --> 1:35:20.700
A world beyond time.

1:35:23.210 --> 1:35:24.620
Beyond death.

1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:30.550
Beyond time...

1:35:30.550 --> 1:35:31.290
Strange.

1:36:04.250 --> 1:36:05.490
He's gone.

1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:10.170
Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power.

1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:45.370
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1:36:45.630 --> 1:36:47.870
You've come to die.

1:36:48.210 --> 1:36:52.300
Your world is now my world...

1:36:52.590 --> 1:36:55.050
like all worlds.

1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:28.330
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1:37:28.670 --> 1:37:31.330
You've come to die.

1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:34.420
Your world is now my...

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:37.090
What is this?

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:39.100
Illusion?

1:37:39.270 --> 1:37:40.600
No. This is real.

1:37:40.850 --> 1:37:42.180
Good.

1:37:52.450 --> 1:37:55.480
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1:37:55.740 --> 1:37:58.980
You've... What is happening?

1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:02.360
Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension...

1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:04.950
I brought a little power from mine.

1:38:05.330 --> 1:38:07.450
This is time.

1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:11.080
Endless looped time.

1:38:11.630 --> 1:38:13.540
You dare!

1:38:17.300 --> 1:38:19.640
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1:38:20.430 --> 1:38:22.920
You cannot do this forever.

1:38:23.100 --> 1:38:24.640
Actually, I can.

1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:27.260
This is how things are now.

1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:30.470
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1:38:30.570 --> 1:38:31.650
endlessly.

1:38:31.940 --> 1:38:35.480
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:36.750
Yes.

1:38:36.950 --> 1:38:39.780
But everyone on Earth will live.

1:38:39.950 --> 1:38:41.530
But you will suffer.

1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:43.660
Pain's an old friend.

1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:47.660
Dormammu...

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.000
I've come to bargain.

1:38:49.170 --> 1:38:50.160
End this!

1:38:50.670 --> 1:38:53.040
Dormammu... Dormammu... Dormammu...

1:39:09.270 --> 1:39:12.260
You will never win.

1:39:13.570 --> 1:39:14.680
No...

1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:16.860
but I can lose...

1:39:17.820 --> 1:39:20.310
again and again...

1:39:21.030 --> 1:39:22.070
and again...

1:39:22.870 --> 1:39:24.860
and again, forever.

1:39:26.370 --> 1:39:27.860
And that makes you my prisoner.

1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:29.280
No!

1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:30.360
Stop!

1:39:31.170 --> 1:39:33.580
Make this stop!

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.870
Set me free!

1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:37.870
No.

1:39:38.510 --> 1:39:40.340
I've come to bargain.

1:39:42.010 --> 1:39:44.380
What do you want?

1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:48.220
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1:39:48.900 --> 1:39:50.890
End your assault on my world.

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:52.930
Never come back.

1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:54.510
Do it...

1:39:55.110 --> 1:39:57.270
and I'll break the loop.

1:40:06.870 --> 1:40:07.910
Get up, Strange!

1:40:08.210 --> 1:40:09.320
Get up and fight.

1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:11.540
We can finish this.

1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:13.070
Isn't it beautiful?

1:40:15.590 --> 1:40:17.920
A world beyond time.

1:40:20.550 --> 1:40:22.090
Beyond death.

1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:35.270
What have you done?

1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:36.980
I made a bargain.

1:40:39.950 --> 1:40:40.940
What is this?

1:40:42.030 --> 1:40:44.860
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1:40:45.950 --> 1:40:48.110
Eternal life as part of the One.

1:40:50.750 --> 1:40:52.490
Youre not gonna like it.

1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:13.720
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1:41:13.810 --> 1:41:16.730
stolen the whole book because the warnings...

1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:19.060
The warnings come after the spells.

1:41:28.740 --> 1:41:30.150
Oh, thats funny.

1:41:57.770 --> 1:41:59.010
We did it.

1:42:01.860 --> 1:42:03.020
Yes.

1:42:03.820 --> 1:42:05.530
Yes, we did it.

1:42:06.530 --> 1:42:07.940
By also violating...

1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:09.690
the natural law.

1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:13.200
Look around you. It's over.

1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:16.160
You still think there will be no consequences, Strange?

1:42:17.630 --> 1:42:19.290
No price to pay?

1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:22.870
We broke our rules, just like her.

1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:27.340
The bill comes due.

1:42:28.050 --> 1:42:29.130
Always!

1:42:30.390 --> 1:42:31.550
A reckoning.

1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:37.480
I will follow this path no longer.

1:43:11.390 --> 1:43:12.850
Yeah, okay.

1:43:22.230 --> 1:43:23.520
Wise choice.

1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:26.360
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1:43:26.450 --> 1:43:28.690
once you've mastered it's powers.

1:43:28.780 --> 1:43:29.940
Until then...

1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:33.690
best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone.

1:43:33.790 --> 1:43:34.820
A what?

1:43:36.210 --> 1:43:38.290
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1:43:38.370 --> 1:43:40.210
but you still have much to learn.

1:43:41.590 --> 1:43:43.340
Word of the Ancient Ones death

1:43:43.340 --> 1:43:45.330
will spread through the Multiverse.

1:43:45.420 --> 1:43:47.960
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

1:43:48.470 --> 1:43:49.460
We must be ready.

1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:50.620
Well be ready.

1:46:37.140 --> 1:46:40.470
So Earth has wizards now, huh?

1:46:42.470 --> 1:46:43.460
Tea?

1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:45.470
I don't drink tea.

1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:46.550
What do you drink?

1:46:47.940 --> 1:46:49.270
Not tea.

1:46:52.780 --> 1:46:54.310
So, I keep a watch list...

1:46:54.570 --> 1:46:56.310
of individuals and beings from other realms

1:46:56.450 --> 1:46:57.730
that may be a threat to this world.

1:46:57.990 --> 1:47:01.570
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.660
Worthy inclusion.

1:47:05.750 --> 1:47:06.910
Yeah.

1:47:08.130 --> 1:47:12.080
So why bring him here to New York?

1:47:12.300 --> 1:47:13.750
it's a bit of a long story.

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:15.830
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1:47:15.930 --> 1:47:17.670
But we're looking for my father.

1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:21.390
Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

1:47:21.470 --> 1:47:24.510
youd all return to Asgard promptly?

1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:25.970
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1:47:26.190 --> 1:47:27.550
Great!

1:47:28.850 --> 1:47:30.470
Allow me to help you.

1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:32.830
Can I help you?

1:53:34.090 --> 1:53:37.210
They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a stretcher.

1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:40.720
Look at you now, Pang born.

1:53:42.100 --> 1:53:43.090
Mordo.

1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:47.770
So what can I do for you, man?

1:53:47.860 --> 1:53:49.690
I've been away for many months now,

1:53:49.780 --> 1:53:51.520
and I'vehad a revelation.

1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:54.940
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:57.860
is to twist things out of their proper shape...

1:53:58.790 --> 1:54:00.280
stealing power...

1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:02.610
perverting nature.

1:54:03.290 --> 1:54:04.620
Like you.

1:54:05.580 --> 1:54:07.920
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1:54:08.750 --> 1:54:09.880
Mine.

1:54:09.880 --> 1:54:10.790
Power...

1:54:11.970 --> 1:54:13.580
has a purpose.

1:54:27.650 --> 1:54:29.760
Why are you doing this?

1:54:29.980 --> 1:54:33.150
Because I see, at long last, what's wrong with the world.

1:54:38.450 --> 1:54:40.570
Too many sorcerers.
