WEBVTT

02:52.300 --> 02:53.820
Are you the guys from Washington?

02:53.930 --> 02:55.730
You get many other visitors out here?

02:55.840 --> 02:57.390
How long you been on-site?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.870
Since this morning.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.600
A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.210
How come nobody spotted it before?

03:04.310 --> 03:06.010
It's really not that surprising.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.610
This landscape's changing all the time.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.550
You got any idea what this thing is exactly?

03:10.650 --> 03:12.710
I don't know. It's probably a weather balloon.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.150
I don't think so.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.280
You know, we don't have the equipment for a job like this.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.020
How long before we can start craning it out?

03:19.330 --> 03:21.020
I don't think you quite understand.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.060
You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.580
Base, we're in.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.980
What is this?

04:35.300 --> 04:36.430
Careful.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.230
Open it!

04:57.320 --> 04:58.620
Lieutenant!

05:01.730 --> 05:03.020
What is it?

05:03.400 --> 05:04.690
My God.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.470
Base, get me a line to the Colonel.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.630
It's 3:00 a.m., sir.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.300
I don't care what time it is. This one's waited long enough.

06:29.150 --> 06:30.710
Quickly, before he...

06:42.760 --> 06:46.560
It has taken me a long time to find this place.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.830
You should be commended.

06:50.940 --> 06:51.930
Help him up.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.840
I think that you are a man of great vision.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.380
And, in this way, we are much alike.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.910
I am nothing like you.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.540
No, of course, but

07:06.220 --> 07:08.580
what others see as superstition,

07:09.020 --> 07:11.180
you and I know to be a science.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.550
What you seek is just a legend.

07:13.660 --> 07:16.180
Then why make such an effort to conceal it?

07:36.580 --> 07:41.380
The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin's treasure room.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.090
It is not something one buries.

07:49.830 --> 07:53.890
But I think it is close, yes?

07:54.670 --> 07:55.960
I cannot help you.

07:56.270 --> 08:00.670
No. But maybe you can help your village.

08:01.070 --> 08:03.030
You must have some friends out there.

08:04.070 --> 08:06.030
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

08:06.780 --> 08:09.150
I have no need for them to die.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.890
Yggdrasil.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.170
Tree of the world.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.130
Guardian of wisdom.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.070
And fate, also.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.680
- Sorry, son.   - Look, just give me a chance.

09:07.070 --> 09:11.700
And the Frer digs for trinkets in the desert.

09:15.150 --> 09:18.120
You have never seen this, have you?

09:18.550 --> 09:22.180
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.890
Exactly.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.390
Give the order to open fire.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.760
Fool!

09:32.400 --> 09:34.700
You cannot control the power you hold.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.820
You will burn!

09:36.940 --> 09:38.660
I already have.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.080
O'Connell, Michael.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.940
Kaminsky, Henry.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.280
Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.

09:58.590 --> 10:00.220
Rogers, Steven.

10:01.290 --> 10:04.090
It kind of makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?

10:04.630 --> 10:05.760
Nope.

10:08.730 --> 10:10.200
Rogers.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.040
- What did your father die of?   - Mustard gas.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.580
He was in the 107th Infantry.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.080
I was hoping I could be assigned...

10:23.180 --> 10:25.880
- Your mother?   - She was a nurse in a TB ward.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.080
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

10:34.790 --> 10:37.350
You'd be ineligible on your asthma alone.

10:37.830 --> 10:38.850
Is there anything you can do?

10:39.360 --> 10:40.660
I'm doing it.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.360
I'm saving your life.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.870
War continues to ravage Europe.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.880
But help is on the way.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.270
Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.880
Even little Timmy is doing his part

11:03.020 --> 11:04.990
collecting scrap metal.

11:05.220 --> 11:06.210
Nice work, Timmy!

11:06.330 --> 11:07.590
Who cares?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.350
Play the movie already!

11:10.460 --> 11:12.160
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

11:12.430 --> 11:13.630
Meanwhile, overseas,

11:13.730 --> 11:16.790
our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price

11:16.900 --> 11:18.630
of freedom is never too high.

11:18.740 --> 11:21.040
Let's go! Get on with it!

11:21.970 --> 11:23.700
Hey, just start the cartoon!

11:23.810 --> 11:24.940
Hey, you wanna shut up?

11:25.880 --> 11:28.510
Together with Allied forces, we'll face any threat,

11:28.610 --> 11:29.940
no matter the size.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.160
You just don't know when to give up, do you?

11:49.900 --> 11:51.700
I can do this all day.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.340
Hey!

11:57.440 --> 11:58.910
Pick on someone your own size.

12:07.150 --> 12:10.120
Sometimes I think you like getting punched.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.450
I had him on the ropes.

12:13.330 --> 12:14.690
How many times is this?

12:15.930 --> 12:18.050
You're from Paramus now?

12:18.330 --> 12:21.060
You know it's illegal to lie on the enlistment form.

12:21.170 --> 12:22.630
And seriously, Jersey?

12:24.470 --> 12:25.870
You get your orders?

12:28.470 --> 12:29.530
The 107th.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.340
Sergeant James Barnes,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.810
shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.810
I should be going.

12:42.420 --> 12:43.410
Come on, man.

12:44.190 --> 12:47.090
My last night! I got to get you cleaned up.

12:47.190 --> 12:48.720
Why? Where are we going?

12:48.860 --> 12:50.160
The future.

12:55.030 --> 12:57.060
I don't see what the problem is.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.760
You're about to be the last eligible man in New York.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.370
You know there's three and a half million women here?

13:02.470 --> 13:03.700
Well, I'd settle for just one.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.140
Good thing I took care of that.

13:06.780 --> 13:07.840
Hey, Bucky!

13:10.180 --> 13:12.240
What'd you tell her about me?

13:12.480 --> 13:14.320
Only the good stuff.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.580
Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion

13:16.450 --> 13:18.250
Come on, soldier.

13:18.690 --> 13:21.320
and the World of Tomorrow.

13:21.830 --> 13:25.630
A greater world. A better world.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.460
Oh, my God! It's starting!

13:33.740 --> 13:36.300
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!

13:46.180 --> 13:48.550
I love you, Howard!

13:50.860 --> 13:52.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:53.020 --> 13:57.650
what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile

13:57.930 --> 14:00.830
won't even have to touch the ground at all?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.970
Yes. Thanks, Mandy.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.370
With Stark Gravitic Reversion Technology

14:07.770 --> 14:09.640
you'll be able to do just that.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.250
Holy cow.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.720
I did say a few years, didn't I?

14:42.340 --> 14:45.640
Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls...

15:01.190 --> 15:03.320
Come on. You're kind of missing the point of a double date.

15:03.430 --> 15:04.900
We're taking the girls dancing.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.020
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.990
You're really going to do this again?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.590
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.400
As who, Steve from Ohio?

15:15.510 --> 15:17.840
They'll catch you. Or worse, they'll actually take you.

15:18.540 --> 15:19.840
Look, I know you don't think I can do this.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.310
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

15:21.610 --> 15:23.380
- I know it's a war.   - Why are you so keen to fight?

15:23.480 --> 15:25.310
- There are so many important jobs.   - What do you want me to do?

15:25.420 --> 15:27.350
Collect scrap metal in my little red wagon?

15:27.380 --> 15:28.680
Thank you.

15:27.450 --> 15:29.040
- Yes. Why not?   - I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

15:29.150 --> 15:31.710
Bucky, come on. There are men laying down their lives.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.850
I got no right to do any less than them.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.590
That's what you don't understand. This isn't about me.

15:38.060 --> 15:41.160
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

15:44.070 --> 15:46.900
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

15:48.170 --> 15:49.940
Yes, we are.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.010
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.140
How can I?

15:59.580 --> 16:01.450
You're taking all the stupid with you.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.780
- You're a punk.   - Jerk.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.250
Be careful.

16:12.630 --> 16:14.160
Don't win the war till I get there!

16:19.300 --> 16:22.210
Come on, girls. They're playing our song.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.990
Wait here.

16:44.030 --> 16:46.430
- Is there a problem?   - Just wait here.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.580
So,

17:12.320 --> 17:15.760
you want to go overseas. Kill some Nazis.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.430
Excuse me?

17:18.800 --> 17:20.390
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.190
I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.630
Steve Rogers.

17:29.140 --> 17:30.700
Where are you from?

17:31.140 --> 17:35.270
Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.720
Before that, Germany.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.620
- This troubles you?   - No.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.750
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?

17:44.090 --> 17:45.780
Is it New Haven?

17:46.890 --> 17:48.290
Or Paramus?

17:49.330 --> 17:51.560
Five exams in five different cities.

17:51.660 --> 17:52.690
That might not be the right file.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.630
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.860
It's the five tries.

17:57.940 --> 18:02.070
But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.030
Is this a test?

18:07.450 --> 18:08.740
Yes.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.480
I don't want to kill anyone.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.350
I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.350
Well, there are already

18:20.460 --> 18:22.390
so many big men fighting this war.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.460
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.300
I can offer you a chance.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.570
Only a chance.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.400
- I'll take it.   - Good.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.440
So where is the little guy from? Actually?

18:39.480 --> 18:40.770
Brooklyn.

18:42.950 --> 18:45.420
Congratulations, soldier.

19:09.570 --> 19:11.700
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

19:13.180 --> 19:16.810
My machine requires the most delicate calibration.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.410
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.110
Are you certain that those conductors of yours

19:23.220 --> 19:27.280
can withstand the energy surge long enough for transference?

19:27.530 --> 19:28.960
With this artifact

19:29.630 --> 19:30.960
I am certain of nothing.

19:31.260 --> 19:33.630
I fear it may not work at all.

20:10.770 --> 20:11.960
Twenty percent.

20:14.210 --> 20:15.540
Forty.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.570
Sixty.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.280
Stabilizing at 70%.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.110
I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor.

20:48.670 --> 20:50.230
What was that?

20:50.840 --> 20:53.940
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

20:54.050 --> 20:57.210
Your designs do not disappoint.

20:57.320 --> 21:01.620
Though they may require some slight reinforcement.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.620
The exchange is stable.

21:05.190 --> 21:06.660
Amazing!

21:07.330 --> 21:09.350
The energy we have just collected

21:09.460 --> 21:12.400
could power my designs. All my designs.

21:14.570 --> 21:17.360
This will change the war.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.830
Dr. Zola,

21:21.240 --> 21:24.170
this will change the world.

21:26.710 --> 21:28.580
Ready, exercise!

21:28.680 --> 21:30.440
Recruits, attention!

21:31.450 --> 21:32.970
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.950
I supervise all operations for this division.

21:36.350 --> 21:38.190
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

21:39.390 --> 21:41.380
I thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.620
What's your name, soldier?

21:43.060 --> 21:44.720
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.520
Step forward, Hodge.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.660
Put your right foot forward.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.430
We gonna wrassle?

21:54.270 --> 21:56.640
'Cause I got a few moves I know you'll like.

21:59.510 --> 22:00.770
Agent Carter!

22:01.150 --> 22:02.510
Colonel Phillips.

22:02.610 --> 22:05.580
I can see that you are breaking in the candidates. That's good!

22:06.320 --> 22:07.580
Get your ass up out of that dirt

22:07.690 --> 22:10.420
and stand in that line at attention till somebody comes tells you what to do.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.950
Yes, sir!

22:15.290 --> 22:17.590
General Patton has said

22:18.160 --> 22:21.790
that wars are fought with weapons, but they are won by men.

22:21.900 --> 22:25.430
We are going to win this war because we have the best men.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.000
And because they are going to get better.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.080
Much better.

22:34.910 --> 22:38.640
The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort

22:38.780 --> 22:41.780
made up of the best minds in the free world.

22:42.290 --> 22:45.380
Our goal is to create the best army in history.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.820
But every army starts with one man.

22:48.260 --> 22:50.060
Rogers! Get off of there!

22:50.160 --> 22:52.250
At the end of this week, we will choose that man.

22:52.830 --> 22:56.460
He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.110
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

23:05.210 --> 23:09.840
And they will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.310
Pick up the pace, ladies!

23:12.980 --> 23:16.440
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

23:16.790 --> 23:19.590
Come on! Faster! Faster!

23:20.060 --> 23:22.360
Move! Move!

23:22.730 --> 23:24.700
Squad, halt!

23:24.700 --> 23:26.910
That flag means we're only at the halfway point.

23:28.330 --> 23:31.730
First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.530
Move, move!

23:34.510 --> 23:36.300
Come on! Get up there!

23:36.570 --> 23:39.270
If that's all you got, this army's in trouble!

23:39.380 --> 23:40.940
Get up there, Hodge!

23:41.250 --> 23:43.580
Come on! Get up there!

23:45.250 --> 23:47.680
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

23:49.520 --> 23:52.650
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

23:52.760 --> 23:55.020
Let's go! Get back into formation!

23:57.560 --> 23:59.760
Rogers! I said fall in!

24:16.050 --> 24:17.570
Thank you, sir.

24:26.390 --> 24:28.590
Faster, ladies! Come on.

24:28.890 --> 24:31.190
My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul.

24:32.660 --> 24:33.650
Move it!

24:33.770 --> 24:35.890
You're not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.900
I'm more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.300
When you brought a 90-pound asthmatic onto my army base,

24:42.410 --> 24:43.810
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

24:43.910 --> 24:45.600
Maybe he'd be useful to you, like a gerbil.

24:45.710 --> 24:46.730
I never thought you'd pick him.

24:46.840 --> 24:48.000
Up.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.850
You stick a needle in that kid's arm, it's gonna go right through him.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.420
- Come on, girls.   - Look at that.

24:56.390 --> 24:57.750
He's making me cry.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.420
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.

25:00.530 --> 25:03.120
Do you know how long it took to set up this project?

25:03.230 --> 25:04.320
All the groveling I had to do

25:04.430 --> 25:05.590
in front of Senator What's-His-Name's committees?

25:05.700 --> 25:07.890
Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.230
Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.240
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

25:13.340 --> 25:14.770
- He's a soldier.   - He is a bully.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.770
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

25:21.110 --> 25:23.910
You win wars with guts.

25:26.050 --> 25:27.210
Grenade!

25:31.760 --> 25:33.050
Get away!

25:33.590 --> 25:34.960
Get back!

25:42.270 --> 25:43.790
It was a dummy grenade.

25:44.900 --> 25:46.890
All clear. Back in formation.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.270
Is this a test?

25:54.050 --> 25:55.170
He's still skinny.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.380
- May I?   - Yeah.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.020
Can't sleep?

26:10.700 --> 26:12.490
I got the jitters, I guess.

26:13.060 --> 26:14.360
Me, too.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.690
Can I ask you a question?

26:17.800 --> 26:19.170
Just one?

26:21.410 --> 26:22.800
Why me?

26:25.840 --> 26:28.640
I suppose that is the only question that matters.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.820
This is from Augsburg. My city.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.550
So many people forget

26:38.660 --> 26:41.120
that the first country the Nazis invaded was their own.

26:41.860 --> 26:45.260
You know, after the last war, my people struggled.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.260
They felt weak. They felt small.

26:48.370 --> 26:50.100
And then Hitler comes along with the marching

26:50.200 --> 26:53.190
and the big show and the flags.

26:54.540 --> 26:58.530
And he hears of me. My work. And he finds me.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.940
And he says, "You."

27:00.880 --> 27:02.640
He says, "You will make us strong."

27:03.410 --> 27:06.040
Well, I am not interested.

27:07.490 --> 27:09.820
So he sends the head of Hydra,

27:10.290 --> 27:12.260
his research division.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.180
A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.890
Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.290
And he is ambitious.

27:19.730 --> 27:25.000
He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.760
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.

27:28.870 --> 27:30.640
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

27:31.140 --> 27:34.130
For him, it is real. He has become convinced

27:34.250 --> 27:36.770
that there is a great power hidden in the earth,

27:36.880 --> 27:38.110
left here by the gods,

27:38.220 --> 27:41.010
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

27:41.590 --> 27:43.610
So when he hears about my formula and what it can do,

27:44.590 --> 27:46.610
he cannot resist.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.220
Schmidt must become that superior man.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.030
Did it make him stronger?

27:59.270 --> 28:00.500
Yes.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.840
But there were other effects.

28:08.310 --> 28:09.440
The serum was not ready.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.650
But more important, the man.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.880
The serum amplifies everything that is inside,

28:16.990 --> 28:20.120
so good becomes great.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.920
Bad becomes worse.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.820
This is why you were chosen.

28:29.970 --> 28:33.490
Because a strong man who has known power all his life

28:33.600 --> 28:35.540
may lose respect for that power,

28:35.640 --> 28:38.800
but a weak man knows the value of strength.

28:39.310 --> 28:41.180
And knows

28:41.710 --> 28:43.010
compassion.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.950
Thanks. I think.

28:54.890 --> 28:57.790
Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.090
That you will stay who you are.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.600
Not a perfect soldier,

29:07.970 --> 29:08.960
but

29:09.470 --> 29:11.440
a good man.

29:16.650 --> 29:18.110
To the little guys.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.180
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

29:22.290 --> 29:24.410
No, you have procedure tomorrow. No fluids.

29:25.690 --> 29:27.520
All right. We'll drink it after.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.390
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.

29:29.390 --> 29:31.190
Drink it after? I drink it now.

29:46.740 --> 29:49.580
Is there something in particular you need?

29:55.450 --> 29:58.250
I understand you found him.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.720
See for yourself.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.360
You disapprove.

30:15.070 --> 30:18.100
I just don't see why you need concern yourself.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.940
I can't imagine he will succeed.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.170
Again.

30:24.580 --> 30:28.580
His serum is the Allies' only defense against this power we now possess.

30:28.690 --> 30:32.280
If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.

30:35.490 --> 30:37.120
Shall I give the order?

30:38.230 --> 30:40.130
It has been given.

30:42.330 --> 30:43.630
Good.

30:46.300 --> 30:47.270
Dr. Zola!

30:51.580 --> 30:52.870
What do you think?

30:59.750 --> 31:01.650
A masterpiece.

31:11.790 --> 31:14.460
Wonderful weather this morning, isn't it?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.660
I know this neighborhood.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.560
I got beat up in that alley.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.230
And that parking lot.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.440
And behind that diner.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.340
Did you have something against running away?

31:29.080 --> 31:31.510
You start running, they'll never let you stop.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.670
You stand up, you push back.

31:33.780 --> 31:35.080
They can't say no forever, right?

31:35.890 --> 31:39.340
I know a little of what that's like, to have every door shut in your face.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.620
I guess I just don't know why you'd want to join the Army

31:42.730 --> 31:44.090
if you were a beautiful dame.

31:44.300 --> 31:45.730
Or a... A woman.

31:45.930 --> 31:47.230
An agent. Not a dame.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.160
You are beautiful, but...

31:49.970 --> 31:52.160
You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?

31:52.740 --> 31:54.700
I think this is the longest conversation I've had with one.

31:56.170 --> 31:59.700
Women aren't exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.

32:00.110 --> 32:01.410
You must have danced.

32:01.510 --> 32:04.170
Well, asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.240
And the past few years, it just

32:07.350 --> 32:10.220
didn't seem to matter that much. I figured I'd wait.

32:10.590 --> 32:11.780
For what?

32:13.420 --> 32:14.820
The right partner.

32:29.370 --> 32:30.770
This way.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.410
- What are we doing here?   - Follow me.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.790
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

33:52.460 --> 33:53.950
Good morning.

33:55.190 --> 33:56.820
Please, not now.

34:01.670 --> 34:02.790
Are you ready?

34:04.870 --> 34:08.430
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie, and your hat.

34:14.140 --> 34:15.770
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.470
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

34:17.580 --> 34:19.450
We needed access to the city's power grid.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.680
Of course, if you'd given me the generators I requisitioned...

34:21.790 --> 34:23.950
A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel.

34:24.050 --> 34:25.450
This is...

34:25.560 --> 34:27.220
Fred Clemson, State Department.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.790
If this project of yours comes through,

34:28.890 --> 34:31.520
we'd like to see it used for something other than headlines.

34:31.630 --> 34:35.360
Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.440
Comfortable?

34:51.550 --> 34:52.670
It's a little big.

34:55.020 --> 34:56.580
You save me any of that schnapps?

34:57.590 --> 35:00.460
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

35:00.860 --> 35:02.160
Next time.

35:03.230 --> 35:05.350
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

35:05.460 --> 35:07.690
- Levels at 100%.   - Good.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.770
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

35:10.230 --> 35:13.030
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.060
Agent Carter?

35:15.170 --> 35:17.440
Don't you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?

35:17.540 --> 35:19.130
- Yes, of course. Sorry.   - Good.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.350
Do you hear me? Is this on?

35:34.360 --> 35:35.450
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:36.190 --> 35:39.630
today we take not another step towards annihilation,

35:40.060 --> 35:41.260
but the first step

35:41.630 --> 35:43.660
on the path to peace.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.060
We begin with a series of microinjections into

35:49.170 --> 35:52.940
the subject's major muscle groups. The serum infusion

35:53.310 --> 35:56.110
will cause immediate cellular change.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.650
And then, to stimulate growth,

35:59.850 --> 36:03.250
the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.

36:10.990 --> 36:12.090
That wasn't so bad.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.060
That was penicillin.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.900
Serum infusion beginning in

36:20.300 --> 36:21.290
five,

36:22.370 --> 36:23.360
four,

36:24.810 --> 36:25.800
three,

36:27.240 --> 36:28.730
two,

36:30.180 --> 36:31.170
one.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.090
Now, Mr. Stark.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.490
Steven? Can you hear me?

37:09.920 --> 37:13.050
It's probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?

37:14.490 --> 37:16.190
We will proceed.

37:28.740 --> 37:29.730
That's 10%.

37:30.910 --> 37:31.900
Twenty percent.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.440
Thirty.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.140
That's 40%.

37:38.650 --> 37:39.640
Vital signs are normal.

37:39.880 --> 37:40.870
That's 50%.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.670
Sixty.

37:44.390 --> 37:45.650
Seventy.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.250
Steven!

37:51.900 --> 37:53.800
- Steven!   - Shut it down!

37:55.130 --> 37:56.160
Shut it down!

37:56.870 --> 37:57.990
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

37:58.240 --> 37:59.790
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

37:59.900 --> 38:01.200
No!

38:01.640 --> 38:04.200
Don't! I can do this!

38:11.150 --> 38:12.170
Eighty.

38:12.880 --> 38:13.870
Ninety.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.250
That's 100%.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.780
Mr. Stark?

38:51.660 --> 38:53.560
Steven. Steven.

38:56.330 --> 38:57.620
The son of a bitch did it.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.430
- I did it.   - Yeah, yeah.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.260
I think we did it.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.560
You actually did it.

39:12.540 --> 39:14.130
How do you feel?

39:17.050 --> 39:18.570
Taller.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.920
You look taller.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.810
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

39:25.260 --> 39:29.120
I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.790
Congratulations, Doctor.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.560
Thank you, sir.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.280
Stop him!

40:52.180 --> 40:54.910
What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right?

40:55.010 --> 40:56.640
Hey, this guy's been shot!

41:07.890 --> 41:08.880
I had him!

41:09.560 --> 41:11.190
Sorry!

41:31.050 --> 41:32.410
I'm sorry!

42:44.920 --> 42:47.550
No! No! Not my son!

42:48.490 --> 42:49.960
- Stop it!   - Don't hurt him!

42:51.960 --> 42:53.220
Get back!

42:54.360 --> 42:55.730
Let me go!

42:58.800 --> 43:00.170
Let go of my son!

43:02.870 --> 43:04.140
Don't hurt him!

43:08.550 --> 43:10.210
Wait, don't! Don't!

43:11.980 --> 43:13.010
No! Don't!

43:19.090 --> 43:21.060
Go get him! I can swim!

44:13.380 --> 44:15.570
- Who the hell are you?   - The first of many.

44:15.950 --> 44:17.680
Cut off one head,

44:19.680 --> 44:21.550
two more shall take its place.

44:23.990 --> 44:25.850
Hail Hydra.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.700
The Frer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.710
He funds your research because you promised him weapons.

44:50.810 --> 44:52.710
You serve at his pleasure.

44:52.820 --> 44:55.680
He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.

44:55.790 --> 44:58.280
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

44:58.420 --> 45:01.050
I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.560
You think this is about appearances?

45:03.660 --> 45:08.060
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.560
And we had learned through local intelligence

45:10.670 --> 45:13.730
you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.740
The Frer feels... How does he put it?

45:15.840 --> 45:19.070
"The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!"

45:31.120 --> 45:32.590
Gentlemen,

45:35.190 --> 45:38.650
you have come to see the results of our work.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.260
Let me show you.

45:42.970 --> 45:45.590
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

45:45.700 --> 45:47.600
but he cannot feed his armies for a month.

45:47.700 --> 45:51.040
His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe,

45:51.140 --> 45:55.170
but still he is no closer to achieving his goals.

45:55.650 --> 45:58.810
And I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic?

45:59.550 --> 46:03.350
Science. But I understand your confusion.

46:03.820 --> 46:06.620
Great power has always baffled primitive men.

46:06.890 --> 46:10.990
Hydra is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

46:11.230 --> 46:14.530
wherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess,

46:14.630 --> 46:15.720
all in a matter of hours.

46:16.070 --> 46:17.360
Your enemies?

46:17.470 --> 46:20.100
My weapons contain enough destructive power

46:20.200 --> 46:22.830
to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

46:25.340 --> 46:26.970
Quite simply, gentlemen,

46:27.910 --> 46:30.400
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

46:32.450 --> 46:33.510
Thank you, Schmidt.

46:33.620 --> 46:34.580
For what?

46:35.050 --> 46:38.280
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.

46:38.390 --> 46:39.790
Berlin is on this map!

46:40.720 --> 46:42.250
So it is.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.950
You will be punished for your insolence!

46:47.060 --> 46:49.590
You will be brought before the Frer himself!

46:58.810 --> 47:00.780
Schmidt...

47:05.750 --> 47:07.680
My apologies, Doctor,

47:07.780 --> 47:09.350
but we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

47:09.350 --> 47:12.740
but we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.150
Hail Hydra.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.650
Hail Hydra!

47:22.270 --> 47:23.990
Hail Hydra!

47:35.650 --> 47:37.240
Think you got enough?

47:37.250 --> 47:40.370
You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that,

47:38.780 --> 47:42.910
Any hope of reproducing the program is locked in your genetic code.

47:43.550 --> 47:46.180
But without Dr. Erskine, it would take years.

47:47.520 --> 47:49.220
He deserved more than this.

47:50.630 --> 47:54.090
If it could work only once, he'd be proud it was you.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.900
Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.830
Great. Why don't we start with how

48:01.940 --> 48:05.100
a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car?

48:05.210 --> 48:06.700
What have we got here?

48:06.810 --> 48:09.840
Speaking modestly, I'm the best mechanical engineer in this country.

48:10.180 --> 48:12.840
But I don't know what's inside this thing or how it works.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.780
We're not even close to this technology.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.510
- Then who is?   - Hydra.

48:17.150 --> 48:18.520
I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.

48:19.060 --> 48:21.050
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.

48:21.160 --> 48:23.350
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

48:23.460 --> 48:27.050
It's led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.360
Hydra is practically a cult.

48:28.460 --> 48:30.060
They worship Schmidt. They think he's invincible.

48:30.570 --> 48:31.730
So, what are you going to do about it?

48:32.800 --> 48:34.030
I spoke to the President this morning.

48:34.540 --> 48:37.560
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.   - Colonel?

48:37.670 --> 48:40.970
We are taking the fight to Hydra. Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.370
You, too, Stark.

48:42.780 --> 48:44.410
We're flying to London tonight.

48:44.510 --> 48:46.810
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.080
You're an experiment. You're going to Alamogordo.

48:49.690 --> 48:50.740
The serum worked.

48:50.850 --> 48:52.650
I asked for an army and all I got was you.

48:53.260 --> 48:55.850
You are not enough.

49:00.030 --> 49:01.330
With all due respect to the Colonel,

49:02.000 --> 49:03.800
I think we may be missing the point.

49:04.170 --> 49:06.270
I've seen you in action, Steve.

49:06.470 --> 49:08.470
More importantly, the country's seen it.

49:08.840 --> 49:09.810
Paper.

49:10.950 --> 49:12.800
The enlistment lines have been around the block

49:12.800 --> 49:15.250
since your picture hit the newsstands.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.410
and hide him in a lab.

49:20.980 --> 49:24.890
Son, do you want to serve your country

49:24.990 --> 49:27.960
on the most important battlefield of the war?

49:29.260 --> 49:31.250
Sir, that's all I want.

49:31.860 --> 49:35.260
Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.600
I don't know if I can do this.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.330
Nothing to it.

49:41.700 --> 49:44.330
You sell a few bonds. Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

49:44.740 --> 49:46.270
You're an American hero.

49:46.510 --> 49:48.670
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

49:49.310 --> 49:51.370
The Senator has got a lot of pull up on the Hill.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.610
You play ball with us,

49:52.720 --> 49:54.650
you'll be leading your own platoon in no time.

49:54.750 --> 49:56.240
Take the shield.

49:57.590 --> 49:58.650
Go.

50:00.020 --> 50:04.650
Who's strong and brave Here to save the American way?

50:05.930 --> 50:08.660
Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank.

50:08.770 --> 50:10.460
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

50:10.570 --> 50:15.230
Who vows to fight like a man For what's right, night and day?

50:15.640 --> 50:17.230
Series E Defense Bonds.

50:17.340 --> 50:19.040
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.040
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.

50:21.180 --> 50:24.640
Who will campaign door-to-door for America?

50:24.750 --> 50:28.010
Carry the flag shore to shore for America?

50:28.120 --> 50:31.180
From Hoboken to Spokane

50:31.290 --> 50:37.280
The star-spangled man with a plan

50:39.660 --> 50:42.390
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.

50:42.530 --> 50:46.530
We can't ignore there's a threat and a war we must win

50:46.640 --> 50:49.430
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy's gun.

50:49.540 --> 50:55.000
Who'll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin?

50:56.480 --> 50:59.780
Who will redeem Heed the call for America?

51:00.020 --> 51:03.080
Who'll rise or fall Give his all for America?

51:03.650 --> 51:06.490
Who's here to prove that we can?

51:06.590 --> 51:12.650
The star-spangled man with a plan

51:13.130 --> 51:15.430
We all know this is about trying to win the war.

51:15.530 --> 51:18.690
We can't do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.000
That's where you come in. Every bond you buy

51:21.100 --> 51:22.330
will help protect someone you love.

51:22.910 --> 51:25.310
- Turn around! He's right behind you!   - Keep our boys armed and ready,

51:25.410 --> 51:28.140
and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us.

51:32.050 --> 51:37.750
Stalwart and steady and true

51:39.220 --> 51:42.190
Forceful and ready to defend

51:42.330 --> 51:46.090
the red, white, and blue

51:46.200 --> 51:49.530
Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?

51:49.530 --> 51:50.090
Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?

51:50.200 --> 51:53.460
Far as an eagle will soar

51:53.570 --> 51:57.200
Who's making Adolf afraid to step out of his box?

51:57.310 --> 52:00.240
He knows what we're fighting for

52:00.410 --> 52:03.780
Who waked the giant that napped in America?

52:03.880 --> 52:07.320
We know it's no one but Captain America

52:08.050 --> 52:09.020
Hi.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.920
Who'll finish what they began?

52:11.020 --> 52:13.090
Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan?

52:15.720 --> 52:17.890
The star-spangled man

52:17.990 --> 52:20.760
with a

52:21.530 --> 52:24.330
plan!

52:32.310 --> 52:36.180
How many of you are ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?

52:40.880 --> 52:42.010
Okay.

52:45.590 --> 52:46.990
I need a volunteer.

52:47.090 --> 52:49.280
I already volunteered! How do you think I got here?

52:50.790 --> 52:52.820
Bring back the girls!

52:56.870 --> 52:59.160
I think they only know the one song, but

52:59.900 --> 53:01.370
I'll see what I can do.

53:01.700 --> 53:03.370
You do that, sweetheart.

53:03.870 --> 53:06.500
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

53:07.580 --> 53:09.940
Come on, guys, we're all on the same team here.

53:10.150 --> 53:12.310
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

53:23.160 --> 53:25.020
Bring back the girls!

53:29.670 --> 53:32.290
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you. Don't worry.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.040
Hello, Steve.

53:43.410 --> 53:44.540
Hi.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.810
- Hi.   - What are you doing here?

53:47.920 --> 53:50.110
Officially, I'm not here at all.

53:50.590 --> 53:52.490
That was quite a performance.

53:52.890 --> 53:53.860
Yeah.

53:55.090 --> 53:56.720
I had to improvise a little bit.

53:57.090 --> 53:59.560
The crowds I'm used to are usually more

54:01.160 --> 54:02.130
twelve.

54:02.230 --> 54:04.170
I understand you're "America's New Hope."

54:04.270 --> 54:06.830
Bond sales take a 10% bump in every state I visit.

54:06.940 --> 54:08.460
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

54:10.110 --> 54:12.170
At least he's got me doing this.

54:12.280 --> 54:13.800
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.

54:14.110 --> 54:16.580
And these are your only two options?

54:16.950 --> 54:19.240
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

54:19.950 --> 54:22.580
You were meant for more than this, you know.

54:28.460 --> 54:29.480
What?

54:30.860 --> 54:33.690
You know, for the longest time, I dreamed about

54:34.300 --> 54:37.600
coming overseas and being on the front lines,

54:37.970 --> 54:39.430
serving my country.

54:40.300 --> 54:42.270
I finally got everything I wanted

54:45.810 --> 54:46.830
and I'm wearing tights.

54:55.480 --> 54:56.950
They look like they've been through hell.

54:57.790 --> 54:58.980
These men more than most.

55:02.830 --> 55:04.990
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.

55:05.830 --> 55:07.790
Two hundred men went up against him,

55:08.660 --> 55:10.790
and less than 50 returned.

55:11.700 --> 55:14.100
Your audience contained what was left of the 107th.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.870
The rest were killed or captured.

55:17.070 --> 55:18.670
The 107th?

55:18.770 --> 55:19.740
What?

55:20.210 --> 55:21.540
Come on.

55:22.650 --> 55:23.610
Colonel Phillips.

55:23.710 --> 55:25.540
Well, if it isn't the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

55:25.650 --> 55:26.910
What's your plan today?

55:27.080 --> 55:28.240
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

55:28.350 --> 55:29.650
You don't get to give me orders, son.

55:29.750 --> 55:32.880
I just need one name, Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

55:33.490 --> 55:35.980
You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won't enjoy.

55:36.090 --> 55:38.090
Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...

55:38.190 --> 55:39.190
I can spell.

55:45.230 --> 55:49.690
I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count.

55:50.040 --> 55:52.100
But the name does sound familiar.

55:52.710 --> 55:53.730
I'm sorry.

55:57.950 --> 56:00.380
What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?

56:00.720 --> 56:02.010
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

56:03.550 --> 56:05.040
But if you know where they are, why not at least...

56:05.150 --> 56:06.880
They're 30 miles behind the lines

56:07.020 --> 56:09.790
through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe.

56:09.890 --> 56:11.360
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

56:11.460 --> 56:14.120
But I don't expect you to understand that because you're a chorus girl.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.800
I think I understand just fine.

56:18.330 --> 56:19.960
Well, then understand it somewhere else.

56:20.300 --> 56:24.500
If I read the posters correctly, you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

56:29.380 --> 56:32.010
Yes, sir. I do.

56:36.120 --> 56:41.110
If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.230
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

56:46.360 --> 56:47.730
If that's what it takes.

56:47.830 --> 56:49.920
You heard the Colonel. Your friend is most likely dead.

56:50.030 --> 56:51.000
You don't know that.

56:51.100 --> 56:53.070
Even so, he's devising a strategy. If he detects...

56:53.170 --> 56:55.970
By the time he's done that, it could be too late.

56:56.070 --> 56:57.100
Steve!

57:03.580 --> 57:07.680
You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?

57:09.390 --> 57:10.680
Every word.

57:12.420 --> 57:13.410
Then you got to let me go.

57:17.030 --> 57:18.820
I can do more than that.

57:19.230 --> 57:22.200
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

57:23.700 --> 57:24.960
Where's my helmet?

57:25.070 --> 57:26.470
Anyone seen Rogers?

57:30.410 --> 57:32.370
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,

57:32.480 --> 57:34.470
tucked between these two mountain ranges.

57:34.580 --> 57:35.640
It's a factory of some kind.

57:35.750 --> 57:37.980
We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.780
Just get me as close as you can.

57:39.880 --> 57:41.540
You two are gonna be in a lot of trouble when you land.

57:41.650 --> 57:42.620
And you won't?

57:42.720 --> 57:45.190
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me, I can just shoot them.

57:45.290 --> 57:46.910
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

57:47.020 --> 57:48.990
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

57:49.090 --> 57:50.120
Agent Carter?

57:50.230 --> 57:51.520
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

57:51.630 --> 57:55.150
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late-night fondue.

58:00.440 --> 58:03.230
Stark is the best civilian pilot I've ever seen.

58:03.510 --> 58:05.970
He's mad enough to brave this airspace. We're lucky to have him.

58:07.740 --> 58:09.510
So, are you two... Do you...

58:11.950 --> 58:13.070
...fondue?

58:14.280 --> 58:16.440
This is your transponder. Activate it when you're ready

58:16.590 --> 58:18.990
and the signal will lead us straight to you.

58:20.090 --> 58:21.950
Are you sure this thing works?

58:22.060 --> 58:24.320
It's been tested more than you, pal.

58:29.470 --> 58:31.990
Get back here! We're taking you all the way in!

58:33.800 --> 58:36.770
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing around and get the hell out of here!

58:37.040 --> 58:39.010
You can't give me orders!

58:39.310 --> 58:41.940
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

59:00.160 --> 59:04.600
As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,

59:04.700 --> 59:07.000
even with components of this size.

59:07.340 --> 59:10.030
Increase the output by 60%

59:10.340 --> 59:13.970
and see to it our other facilities do the same.

59:14.510 --> 59:18.810
But these prisoners, I'm not sure they have the strength.

59:19.180 --> 59:22.150
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.

59:22.690 --> 59:25.480
There are always more workers.

59:27.520 --> 59:28.650
Not now!

59:44.040 --> 59:45.840
You know, Fritz,

59:46.880 --> 59:49.170
one of these days, I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

1:00:22.310 --> 1:00:23.440
Fellas.

1:02:25.030 --> 1:02:26.330
Who are you supposed to be?

1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.970
I'm Captain America.

1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:32.670
I beg your pardon?

1:02:36.110 --> 1:02:37.910
What, are we taking everybody?

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:39.840
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

1:02:40.050 --> 1:02:42.780
Is there anybody else? I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.

1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:46.090
There's an isolation ward in the factory, but no one's ever come back from it.

1:02:46.190 --> 1:02:47.280
All right.

1:02:47.390 --> 1:02:49.410
The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate.

1:02:49.530 --> 1:02:51.720
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

1:02:51.830 --> 1:02:53.520
I'll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.

1:02:53.630 --> 1:02:56.150
Wait. You know what you're doing?

1:02:56.270 --> 1:02:59.100
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.

1:03:24.130 --> 1:03:25.860
You know how to use that thing?

1:03:29.870 --> 1:03:30.830
Okay.

1:03:33.170 --> 1:03:34.640
What is happening?

1:03:42.950 --> 1:03:44.910
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:48.350
- That one. "Zdung."   - Zdung?

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:50.250
Get this thing going, Dugan!

1:03:50.350 --> 1:03:51.680
I didn't know you spoke German.

1:03:51.790 --> 1:03:54.980
Three semesters at Howard, switched to French, girls much cuter.

1:03:55.090 --> 1:03:56.060
Didn't ask for the resume.

1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:10.200
- On your left!   - Up top!

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:30.120
No, no! What are you doing?

1:04:31.230 --> 1:04:34.200
Our forces are outmatched.

1:04:58.850 --> 1:05:01.550
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:44.160
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

1:05:45.270 --> 1:05:46.230
Bucky?

1:05:47.370 --> 1:05:48.340
Oh, my God.

1:05:53.480 --> 1:05:54.940
- Is that...   - It's me.

1:05:55.180 --> 1:05:57.010
- It's Steve.   - Steve?

1:05:57.110 --> 1:05:58.550
- Come on.   - Steve.

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:03.840
I thought you were dead.

1:06:04.790 --> 1:06:06.150
I thought you were smaller.

1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:15.120
Come on.

1:06:17.570 --> 1:06:20.360
- What happened to you?   - I joined the Army.

1:06:26.740 --> 1:06:28.800
- Did it hurt?   - A little.

1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:30.540
Is this permanent?

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:31.800
So far.

1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:03.470
Captain America!

1:07:03.700 --> 1:07:05.330
How exciting!

1:07:05.870 --> 1:07:08.840
I am a great fan of your films!

1:07:10.540 --> 1:07:14.500
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:16.670
Not exactly an improvement,

1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:20.080
but still, impressive.

1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:24.350
You've got no idea.

1:07:27.460 --> 1:07:28.510
Haven't I?

1:07:44.210 --> 1:07:47.200
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:50.670
you see, I was his greatest success!

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:05.960
You don't have one of those, do you?

1:08:06.260 --> 1:08:08.560
You are deluded, Captain.

1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:11.890
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.400
but in reality, you are just afraid

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:18.130
to admit that we have left humanity behind.

1:08:19.940 --> 1:08:22.640
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

1:08:23.850 --> 1:08:24.900
Without fear!

1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:26.480
Then how come you're running?

1:08:38.590 --> 1:08:40.620
Come on, let's go. Up.

1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:45.930
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

1:08:49.470 --> 1:08:50.770
What about me?

1:08:51.010 --> 1:08:52.800
Where will I sit?

1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:55.140
Not a scratch, Doctor.

1:08:55.310 --> 1:08:56.780
Not a scratch.

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:32.010
Let's go. One at a time.

1:10:00.710 --> 1:10:03.680
- Gotta be a rope or something!   - Just go! Get out of here!

1:10:03.780 --> 1:10:05.140
No! Not without you!

1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:07.380
Hell.

1:10:28.570 --> 1:10:31.900
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

1:10:32.010 --> 1:10:36.810
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third.

1:10:36.910 --> 1:10:39.040
Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful.

1:10:39.150 --> 1:10:43.110
As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers

1:10:43.990 --> 1:10:46.110
killed in action. Period.

1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.890
The last surveillance flight is back.

1:10:54.330 --> 1:10:56.300
No sign of activity.

1:10:57.100 --> 1:10:59.860
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.   - Yes, sir.

1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:03.630
I can't touch Stark.

1:11:03.770 --> 1:11:06.570
He's rich and he's the Army's number one weapons contractor.

1:11:06.670 --> 1:11:08.160
You are neither one.

1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:10.740
With respect, sir, I don't regret my actions.

1:11:10.850 --> 1:11:12.510
And I don't think Captain Rogers did, either.

1:11:12.610 --> 1:11:15.410
What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions?

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:17.310
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

1:11:17.420 --> 1:11:20.980
And now America's golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead

1:11:21.090 --> 1:11:22.060
'cause you had a crush.

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:24.490
It wasn't that. I had faith.

1:11:25.030 --> 1:11:26.090
Well,

1:11:26.090 --> 1:11:27.790
I hope that's a big comfort to you when they shut this division down.

1:11:27.790 --> 1:11:29.590
I hope that's a big comfort to you when they shut this division down.

1:11:32.130 --> 1:11:33.430
What the hell's going on out there?

1:12:16.380 --> 1:12:18.140
Look who it is!

1:12:45.310 --> 1:12:47.430
Some of these men need medical attention.

1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:49.440
- Medic, we got wounded.   - Right over here.

1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:52.100
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.

1:12:53.550 --> 1:12:55.180
That won't be necessary.

1:12:59.050 --> 1:13:00.280
Yes, sir.

1:13:01.860 --> 1:13:03.320
Faith, huh?

1:13:10.060 --> 1:13:11.330
You're late.

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:16.860
Couldn't call my ride.

1:13:20.910 --> 1:13:22.540
Hey!

1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:42.860
Let's hear it for Captain America!

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.590
I am honored to present this medal for valor

1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:50.860
to my personal friend, Captain America!

1:13:52.470 --> 1:13:54.440
Captain America!

1:13:58.250 --> 1:14:00.270
Captain, that's your cue!

1:14:04.470 --> 1:14:07.440
I thought he'd be taller.

1:14:12.290 --> 1:14:15.350
The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.

1:14:15.460 --> 1:14:17.590
And the sixth one was

1:14:18.130 --> 1:14:23.090
about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.

1:14:24.910 --> 1:14:26.770
I just got a quick look.

1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:29.440
Well, nobody's perfect.

1:14:32.750 --> 1:14:35.110
These are the weapon factories we know about.

1:14:35.580 --> 1:14:37.410
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped

1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:40.040
all the parts to another facility that isn't on this map.

1:14:40.150 --> 1:14:41.780
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

1:14:41.890 --> 1:14:44.550
I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.

1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:45.680
What about us?

1:14:45.790 --> 1:14:48.560
We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.

1:14:48.660 --> 1:14:50.630
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

1:14:50.730 --> 1:14:52.630
You think you can wipe Hydra off it?

1:14:52.630 --> 1:14:54.330
Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

1:14:54.770 --> 1:14:56.790
We're already putting together the best men.

1:14:57.170 --> 1:14:59.970
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

1:15:01.340 --> 1:15:02.710
So, let's get this straight.

1:15:02.810 --> 1:15:04.800
We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?

1:15:06.550 --> 1:15:07.780
Pretty much.

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.180
Sounds rather fun, actually.

1:15:11.890 --> 1:15:12.850
I'm in.

1:15:25.530 --> 1:15:26.830
We're in.

1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:31.030
Hell, I'll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.

1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:32.130
What's that?

1:15:34.310 --> 1:15:35.330
Open a tab.

1:15:39.210 --> 1:15:40.680
Well, that was easy.

1:15:41.050 --> 1:15:43.480
- Another round.   - Where are they putting all this stuff?

1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:49.680
See? I told you.

1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.290
They're all idiots.

1:15:52.890 --> 1:15:54.190
How about you?

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.020
You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?

1:15:58.330 --> 1:15:59.460
Hell, no.

1:15:59.570 --> 1:16:04.030
That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight.

1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:06.870
I'm following him.

1:16:10.410 --> 1:16:11.780
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

1:16:14.750 --> 1:16:15.880
You know what?

1:16:17.050 --> 1:16:18.180
It's kind of growing on me.

1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:31.060
- Captain.   - Agent Carter.

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:34.770
Ma'am.

1:16:34.870 --> 1:16:37.840
Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?

1:16:37.940 --> 1:16:39.240
Sounds good.

1:16:43.950 --> 1:16:46.640
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

1:16:47.110 --> 1:16:48.080
You don't like music?

1:16:48.180 --> 1:16:49.550
I do, actually.

1:16:51.350 --> 1:16:54.810
I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.

1:16:55.190 --> 1:16:56.490
Then what are we waiting for?

1:16:57.460 --> 1:16:58.980
The right partner.

1:17:00.130 --> 1:17:01.420
0800, Captain.

1:17:02.630 --> 1:17:04.930
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:06.820
I'm invisible.

1:17:07.370 --> 1:17:10.430
I'm turning into you. It's like a horrible dream.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:14.100
Don't take it so hard. Maybe she's got a friend.

1:17:15.810 --> 1:17:18.440
Emission signature is unusual.

1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:20.950
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

1:17:22.380 --> 1:17:24.780
Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that.

1:17:26.490 --> 1:17:27.780
Seems harmless enough.

1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:31.020
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1:17:40.570 --> 1:17:41.870
Write that down.

1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:46.530
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.700
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1:17:53.510 --> 1:17:56.310
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:05.060
I read about what you did.

1:18:05.430 --> 1:18:07.050
Oh, the... Yeah.

1:18:07.860 --> 1:18:09.390
Well, that's, you know.

1:18:11.030 --> 1:18:12.430
Just doing what needed to be done.

1:18:12.770 --> 1:18:15.600
Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly 400 men.

1:18:21.940 --> 1:18:23.910
Really, it's not a big deal.

1:18:24.810 --> 1:18:26.940
Tell that to their wives.

1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:31.910
I don't think they were all married.

1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:33.680
You're a hero.

1:18:33.790 --> 1:18:36.280
Well, that depends on the definition, really.

1:18:36.390 --> 1:18:39.690
The women of America, they owe you their thanks.

1:18:40.900 --> 1:18:43.830
And seeing as they're not here...

1:18:52.510 --> 1:18:53.500
Captain!

1:18:53.610 --> 1:18:56.240
We're ready for you, if you're not otherwise occupied.

1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:58.850
Agent Carter, wait.

1:18:59.150 --> 1:19:01.270
Looks like finding a partner wasn't that hard after all.

1:19:01.380 --> 1:19:02.970
Peggy, that's not what you thought it was.

1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:05.680
I don't think anything, Captain, not one thing.

1:19:05.990 --> 1:19:09.620
You always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are, just like all the rest.

1:19:09.890 --> 1:19:10.980
Well, what about you and Stark?

1:19:11.090 --> 1:19:13.560
How do I know you two haven't been fondue-ing?

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:20.800
You still don't know a bloody thing about women.

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:24.390
Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.

1:19:24.510 --> 1:19:27.300
- Really? I didn't think...   - Nor should you, pal.

1:19:27.410 --> 1:19:29.400
The moment you think you know what's going on in a woman's head

1:19:29.510 --> 1:19:31.880
is the moment your goose is well and truly cooked.

1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:34.640
Me, I concentrate on work, which at the moment

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:37.580
is about making sure you and your men do not get killed.

1:19:37.850 --> 1:19:39.550
Carbon polymer.

1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:42.590
Should withstand your average German bayonet.

1:19:42.690 --> 1:19:46.150
Although Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife.

1:19:46.530 --> 1:19:49.260
I hear you're kind of attached.

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:50.760
It's handier than you might think.

1:19:50.870 --> 1:19:52.990
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.

1:19:53.700 --> 1:19:54.730
This one's fun.

1:19:55.570 --> 1:19:58.090
She's been fitted with electrical relays that allow you to...

1:19:58.210 --> 1:19:59.760
- What about this one?   - No, no, that's just a prototype.

1:19:59.870 --> 1:20:02.000
- What's it made of?   - Vibranium.

1:20:03.110 --> 1:20:05.740
It's stronger than steel and a third the weight.

1:20:06.380 --> 1:20:09.180
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1:20:11.190 --> 1:20:12.740
How come it's not standard issue?

1:20:12.850 --> 1:20:14.180
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1:20:14.290 --> 1:20:15.950
What you're holding there, that's all we've got.

1:20:16.060 --> 1:20:18.250
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:20.190
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.

1:20:20.290 --> 1:20:22.190
What do you think?

1:20:32.070 --> 1:20:34.040
Yes, I think it works.

1:20:43.350 --> 1:20:45.480
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1:20:45.750 --> 1:20:47.240
Whatever you want, pal.

1:22:51.950 --> 1:22:54.280
You are failing!

1:22:55.180 --> 1:22:58.450
We are close to an offensive that will shake the planet,

1:22:58.550 --> 1:23:00.490
yet we are continually delayed

1:23:00.590 --> 1:23:03.250
because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:05.330
This is hardly my area of expertise.

1:23:05.430 --> 1:23:09.120
I merely developed the weapons. I cannot fire them.

1:23:10.430 --> 1:23:13.700
Finish your mission, Doctor, before the American finishes his.

1:23:14.470 --> 1:23:15.460
Sir!

1:23:17.770 --> 1:23:18.800
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

1:23:20.370 --> 1:23:22.170
We fought to the last man.

1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:27.450
Evidently not.

1:23:39.660 --> 1:23:42.860
Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.590
Yeah, and I threw up?

1:23:45.930 --> 1:23:47.400
This isn't payback, is it?

1:23:47.500 --> 1:23:49.230
Now why would I do that?

1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:52.070
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

1:23:52.170 --> 1:23:55.700
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.

1:23:55.810 --> 1:23:57.710
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.

1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:07.180
Let's get going, because they're moving like the devil.

1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:09.520
We only got about a 10-second window.

1:24:09.620 --> 1:24:12.180
You miss that window, we're bugs on a windshield.

1:24:12.830 --> 1:24:13.790
Mind the gap.

1:24:13.890 --> 1:24:15.760
Better get moving, bugs!

1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:25.690
Stop him! Fire again!

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:20.880
- I had him on the ropes.   - I know you did.

1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:22.580
Get down!

1:26:24.830 --> 1:26:26.160
Fire again!

1:26:26.930 --> 1:26:28.450
Kill him! Now!

1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:36.700
Bucky!

1:26:40.810 --> 1:26:42.240
Hang on!

1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:44.940
Grab my hand!

1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:51.840
Sit down.

1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:00.620
- What is this?   - Steak.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:02.680
What is in it?

1:28:03.820 --> 1:28:05.120
Cow.

1:28:08.230 --> 1:28:11.220
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

1:28:11.330 --> 1:28:14.130
to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?

1:28:15.570 --> 1:28:16.970
I don't eat meat.

1:28:17.910 --> 1:28:19.030
Why not?

1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:20.800
It disagrees with me.

1:28:20.910 --> 1:28:23.810
How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy, too?

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:29.910
Every Hydra agent that we've tried to take alive

1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:34.820
has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you.

1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:38.650
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1:28:40.930 --> 1:28:42.230
You want to live.

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.720
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1:28:46.370 --> 1:28:47.960
I bought you dinner.

1:28:53.210 --> 1:28:56.270
"Given the valuable information he has provided

1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:00.610
"and in exchange for his full cooperation,

1:29:01.050 --> 1:29:03.920
"Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland"?

1:29:04.020 --> 1:29:07.980
I sent that message to Washington this morning, of course it was encoded.

1:29:08.690 --> 1:29:12.280
You guys haven't broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.

1:29:12.390 --> 1:29:14.360
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1:29:14.460 --> 1:29:18.020
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc. You're a liability.

1:29:18.470 --> 1:29:20.430
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:25.930
And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:28.970
so I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.

1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:32.370
It's you or Schmidt.

1:29:32.980 --> 1:29:35.040
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1:29:37.650 --> 1:29:40.750
Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods.

1:29:42.490 --> 1:29:45.290
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1:29:45.390 --> 1:29:47.590
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1:29:47.690 --> 1:29:48.660
What?

1:29:49.700 --> 1:29:51.890
The sanity of the plan is of no consequence.

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.130
- And why is that?   - Because he can do it!

1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:56.130
What's his target?

1:29:57.440 --> 1:29:59.770
His target

1:30:01.340 --> 1:30:02.400
is everywhere.

1:30:23.230 --> 1:30:24.860
Tomorrow,

1:30:25.630 --> 1:30:28.930
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:32.170
borne to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.

1:30:33.340 --> 1:30:37.240
Our enemies' weapons will be powerless against us.

1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:42.840
If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1:30:47.350 --> 1:30:49.720
If they cut off one head,

1:30:50.260 --> 1:30:53.020
two more shall take its place.

1:30:53.390 --> 1:30:54.690
Hail Hydra.

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:55.960
- Hail Hydra!   - Hail Hydra!

1:30:56.660 --> 1:30:59.290
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!   - Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:14.080
Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.

1:31:14.450 --> 1:31:16.420
Please wait for the all-clear.

1:31:16.780 --> 1:31:21.740
Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice.

1:31:22.460 --> 1:31:25.520
Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.

1:31:33.530 --> 1:31:35.500
Dr. Erskine said that

1:31:35.870 --> 1:31:38.340
the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles,

1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:40.500
it would affect my cells.

1:31:41.540 --> 1:31:45.340
Create a protective system of regeneration and healing.

1:31:45.450 --> 1:31:47.070
Which means

1:31:49.380 --> 1:31:51.010
I can't get drunk.

1:31:52.820 --> 1:31:54.120
Did you know that?

1:31:54.550 --> 1:31:58.790
Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person.

1:32:00.530 --> 1:32:03.160
He thought it could be one of the side effects.

1:32:08.170 --> 1:32:10.140
It wasn't your fault.

1:32:11.300 --> 1:32:12.930
- Did you read the report?   - Yes.

1:32:14.140 --> 1:32:15.440
Then you know that's not true.

1:32:15.540 --> 1:32:17.270
You did everything you could.

1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:22.810
Did you believe in your friend?

1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:24.380
Did you respect him?

1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:27.920
Then stop blaming yourself.

1:32:28.290 --> 1:32:30.620
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:32.510
He damn well must have thought you were worth it.

1:32:35.130 --> 1:32:36.650
I'm going after Schmidt.

1:32:38.300 --> 1:32:41.600
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.

1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:45.160
You won't be alone.

1:32:47.810 --> 1:32:50.970
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse. He thinks he's a god,

1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:53.010
and he's willing to blow up half the world to prove it,

1:32:53.110 --> 1:32:54.670
starting with the USA.

1:32:54.780 --> 1:32:57.880
Schmidt's working with powers beyond our capabilities.

1:32:57.980 --> 1:32:59.710
He gets across the Atlantic,

1:32:59.820 --> 1:33:02.220
he will wipe out the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1:33:06.690 --> 1:33:08.290
How much time we got?

1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:10.660
According to my new best friend, under 24 hours.

1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:13.730
- Where is he now?   - Hydra's last base is here.

1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:18.000
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:21.440
So what are we supposed to do?

1:33:21.540 --> 1:33:24.100
I mean, it's not like we can just knock on the front door.

1:33:24.780 --> 1:33:26.080
Why not?

1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:33.350
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:43.080
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait,

1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:45.280
but I must say, you do it better than anyone.

1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:50.850
But there are limits

1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:53.490
to what even you can do, Captain.

1:35:53.990 --> 1:35:57.230
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1:35:57.330 --> 1:35:58.760
He told me you were insane.

1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:05.470
He resented my genius

1:36:05.570 --> 1:36:09.130
and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.

1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:10.800
But he gave you everything.

1:36:13.250 --> 1:36:14.470
So,

1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:18.840
what made you so special?

1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:23.180
Nothing.

1:36:24.390 --> 1:36:25.920
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1:36:37.470 --> 1:36:39.030
I can do this all day.

1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:41.130
Of course you can, of course.

1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:44.540
But, unfortunately, I am on a tight schedule.

1:36:50.250 --> 1:36:51.620
So am I.

1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:06.730
Rogers! You might need this!

1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:08.170
Thanks!

1:37:19.410 --> 1:37:21.900
We're in! Assault team, go!

1:37:22.150 --> 1:37:23.450
Move out!

1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:26.110
Move!

1:37:32.030 --> 1:37:34.050
Keep your spacing!

1:38:13.670 --> 1:38:15.830
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1:38:17.370 --> 1:38:19.030
Let's go find two more!

1:38:28.410 --> 1:38:29.400
Get in!

1:38:45.770 --> 1:38:46.730
You're late.

1:38:49.770 --> 1:38:51.740
- Weren't you about to...   - Right.

1:40:36.110 --> 1:40:37.410
- Keep it steady!   - Wait!

1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:44.180
Go get him.

1:40:46.150 --> 1:40:47.810
I'm not kissing you!

1:42:49.310 --> 1:42:52.430
- You don't give up, do you?   - Nope!

1:45:39.310 --> 1:45:41.870
You could have the power of the gods!

1:45:41.410 --> 1:45:43.470
Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?

1:45:42.580 --> 1:45:47.210
Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations!

1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:50.250
I have seen the future, Captain!

1:45:51.220 --> 1:45:54.250
- There are no flags!   - Not my future!

1:46:08.140 --> 1:46:09.160
What have you done?

1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:11.110
No!

1:47:21.750 --> 1:47:22.910
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1:47:23.020 --> 1:47:24.410
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:26.010
Peggy, Schmidt's dead!

1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:28.240
What about the plane?

1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:31.590
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:34.420
Give me your coordinates. I'll find you a safe landing site.

1:47:35.730 --> 1:47:37.820
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1:47:38.100 --> 1:47:39.690
But I can try and force it down.

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.770
I'll get Howard on the line. He'll know what to do.

1:47:41.870 --> 1:47:42.860
There's not enough time.

1:47:42.970 --> 1:47:45.560
This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York.

1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:51.940
I got to put her in the water.

1:47:52.410 --> 1:47:55.110
Please, don't do this. We have time. We can work it out.

1:47:55.410 --> 1:47:56.540
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1:47:56.650 --> 1:47:59.050
If I wait any longer, a lot of people are gonna die.

1:48:04.590 --> 1:48:05.780
Peggy,

1:48:07.590 --> 1:48:08.860
this is my choice.

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.250
Peggy?

1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:36.420
I'm here.

1:48:39.290 --> 1:48:42.090
I'm gonna need a rain check on that dance.

1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:51.430
All right.

1:48:54.470 --> 1:48:56.840
A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.

1:48:58.310 --> 1:48:59.610
You got it.

1:49:01.550 --> 1:49:05.510
8:00 on the dot. Don't you dare be late. Understood?

1:49:07.890 --> 1:49:09.950
You know, I still don't know how to dance.

1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.130
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:22.130
We'll have the band play something slow.

1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:27.800
I'd hate to step on your...

1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:31.810
Steve?

1:49:34.350 --> 1:49:35.640
Steve?

1:49:39.020 --> 1:49:40.210
Steve?

1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:40.750
To the Captain.

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:47.640
Curve ball, high and outside for ball one.

1:50:52.930 --> 1:50:53.890
Sir?

1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:06.000
Take us to the next grid point.

1:51:06.270 --> 1:51:08.330
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:11.670
And the energy signature stops here.

1:51:12.780 --> 1:51:14.510
Just keep looking.

1:52:26.950 --> 1:52:29.650
So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.

1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:32.920
And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat,

1:52:33.030 --> 1:52:35.890
this fellow's capable of making it a brand-new game again.

1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:40.490
Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field.

1:52:41.370 --> 1:52:44.530
The Phillies have managed to tie it up at 4-4.

1:52:45.370 --> 1:52:47.670
But the Dodgers have three men on.

1:52:52.210 --> 1:52:55.010
Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month.

1:52:55.150 --> 1:52:58.280
Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here to return the favor?

1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:00.840
Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.

1:53:01.220 --> 1:53:04.280
Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo.

1:53:06.230 --> 1:53:07.520
Three runs will score.

1:53:07.890 --> 1:53:11.350
Reiser heads to third. Durocher's going to wave him in.

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:14.700
Here comes the relay, but they won't get him.

1:53:16.170 --> 1:53:17.140
Good morning.

1:53:19.170 --> 1:53:20.870
Or should I say afternoon?

1:53:22.010 --> 1:53:23.030
Where am I?

1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:25.830
You're in a recovery room in New York City.

1:53:27.750 --> 1:53:31.200
The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers!

1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:33.380
Everyone is on their feet.

1:53:33.750 --> 1:53:37.090
What a game we have here today, folks. What a game, indeed.

1:53:37.190 --> 1:53:38.420
Where am I really?

1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:41.730
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1:53:42.530 --> 1:53:43.830
The game.

1:53:44.030 --> 1:53:46.900
It's from May 1941. I know, 'cause I was there.

1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:52.900
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1:53:53.470 --> 1:53:54.440
Where am I?

1:53:55.810 --> 1:53:57.110
- Captain Rogers...   - Who are you?

1:54:04.750 --> 1:54:06.380
Captain Rogers, wait!

1:54:08.220 --> 1:54:09.920
All agents, code 13!

1:54:10.420 --> 1:54:13.260
I repeat. All agents, code 13!

1:54:33.910 --> 1:54:35.440
At ease, soldier!

1:54:44.020 --> 1:54:46.920
Look, I'm sorry about that little show back there,

1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:51.230
but we thought it best to break it to you slowly.

1:54:51.430 --> 1:54:52.730
Break what?

1:54:55.170 --> 1:54:56.790
You've been asleep, Cap.

1:54:57.300 --> 1:54:59.330
For almost 70 years.

1:55:13.950 --> 1:55:15.150
You gonna be okay?

1:55:16.550 --> 1:55:17.310
Yeah.

1:55:17.690 --> 1:55:18.990
Yeah, I just...

1:55:22.430 --> 1:55:24.300
I had a date.

2:03:07.590 --> 2:03:09.220
Trouble sleeping?

2:04:50.100 --> 2:04:51.390
You're here with a mission, sir?

2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:53.350
I am.

2:04:54.100 --> 2:04:55.900
Trying to get me back in the world?

2:04:57.140 --> 2:04:58.360
Trying to save it.

2:05:07.450 --> 2:05:09.210
You think you're the only hero in the world?

2:05:23.460 --> 2:05:24.590
Gentlemen?

2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:26.450
You're up.

2:05:32.440 --> 2:05:33.400
Got a mean swing.
