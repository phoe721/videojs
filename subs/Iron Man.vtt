WEBVTT

01:24.740 --> 01:27.360
I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy

01:27.530 --> 01:30.280
What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me

01:30.490 --> 01:32.870
What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...

01:33.030 --> 01:36.040
- We can talk, sir. - Oh, I see. So it's personal?

01:36.200 --> 01:37.790
No, you intimidate them

01:38.000 --> 01:40.920
Dear God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that

01:41.080 --> 01:43.670
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here?

01:43.880 --> 01:46.250
- I thought of you as a soldier first. - I'm an airman

01:46.460 --> 01:49.460
Well you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda...

01:49.670 --> 01:52.470
having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.470
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!

01:54.680 --> 01:57.060
- Sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please

01:57.260 --> 02:00.480
It is true you went 12-for-12 with last year's Maxim cover models?

02:00.730 --> 02:02.310
That is an excellent question

02:02.520 --> 02:04.940
Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict

02:05.150 --> 02:08.480
but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?

02:08.900 --> 02:10.610
You're kidding me with a hand up, right?

02:10.900 --> 02:12.900
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?

02:13.110 --> 02:14.780
Yes, it's very cool

02:19.280 --> 02:21.490
I don't wanna see this on your MySpace page

02:21.700 --> 02:23.250
Please, no gang signs

02:23.450 --> 02:24.960
No, throw it up, I'm kidding

02:25.160 --> 02:28.170
Yeah, peace! I love peace. I'd be outta job with peace

02:28.460 --> 02:32.210
C'mon! Just click it, don't change the settings, just click it

02:37.680 --> 02:39.380
What's going on?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.890
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

02:45.100 --> 02:46.470
Lie down!

02:52.270 --> 02:53.770
Son of a bitch!

02:55.440 --> 02:58.280
- Wait, wait, give me a gun! - Stay here!

04:18.100 --> 04:19.560
Tony Stark

04:22.020 --> 04:25.440
Visionary. Genius. American patriot

04:26.190 --> 04:27.940
Even from an early age

04:28.150 --> 04:30.530
the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark

04:30.730 --> 04:33.780
quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind

04:33.990 --> 04:37.030
At age four, he built his first circuit board

04:37.280 --> 04:40.030
At age six, his first engine

04:40.410 --> 04:44.250
And at seventeen, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT

04:45.040 --> 04:47.920
Then, the passing of a titan

04:48.920 --> 04:51.920
Howard Stark's life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane

04:52.130 --> 04:55.260
steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder

04:55.420 --> 04:58.590
Until at age 21, the prodigal son returns

04:58.760 --> 05:02.010
and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries

05:02.220 --> 05:05.270
With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era

05:05.470 --> 05:08.180
for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons

05:08.390 --> 05:10.770
advanced robotics, satellite targeting

05:10.980 --> 05:14.650
Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry

05:14.820 --> 05:16.400
by ensuring freedom

05:16.610 --> 05:20.490
and protecting America and her interests around the globe

05:28.700 --> 05:31.210
As liaison to Stark Industries

05:31.500 --> 05:35.330
I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot

05:35.540 --> 05:39.090
He is my friend and he is my great mentor

05:39.500 --> 05:42.090
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

05:42.300 --> 05:46.340
to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark!

05:53.390 --> 05:55.270
Tony?

06:07.110 --> 06:09.160
Thank you, Colonel

06:09.860 --> 06:12.280
This is beautiful. Thank you

06:12.490 --> 06:15.490
Thank you all very much. This is wonderful

06:16.910 --> 06:19.540
Well, I'm not Tony Stark

06:20.710 --> 06:22.710
But if I were Tony...

06:23.130 --> 06:26.130
...I would tell you how honored I feel

06:26.500 --> 06:30.760
and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award

06:31.470 --> 06:34.890
Tony, you know, the best thing about Tony...

06:35.050 --> 06:38.470
...is also the worst thing  he's always working

06:43.060 --> 06:44.520
C'mon!

06:46.940 --> 06:48.940
We should just stay till the morning

06:49.150 --> 06:52.570
- You are unbelievable! - Oh, no. They roped you into this?

06:52.740 --> 06:55.360
Nobody roped me into anything. But they told me...

06:55.570 --> 06:58.120
that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored

06:58.280 --> 07:00.490
Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you!

07:00.700 --> 07:03.540
- That's great. So when do we do it? One more round. - There you go

07:03.750 --> 07:06.080
- There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK

07:06.290 --> 07:08.670
Wow, would you look at that? That's... that's something else

07:08.880 --> 07:11.460
I don't have any of those swooping around. All right, ride!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.840
Give me a hand, will you? OK, you too

07:16.260 --> 07:18.470
I don't blow on man's hands

07:18.630 --> 07:21.010
There it is! It's the Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...

07:21.220 --> 07:22.850
That's what happens

07:23.010 --> 07:25.220
Worse things have happened, I think we're gonna be fine

07:25.430 --> 07:27.140
- Color me up, will you? - This is where I exit

07:27.350 --> 07:29.390
- Tomorrow don't be late. - Yeah, you can count on it

07:29.600 --> 07:31.100
- I'm serious. - I know, I know

07:31.270 --> 07:34.440
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. There you go

07:39.070 --> 07:41.280
Mr. Stark! Excuse me! Mr. Stark!

07:41.490 --> 07:43.820
Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine

07:44.030 --> 07:45.660
- Can I ask you a couple of questions? - She's cute

07:45.870 --> 07:47.830
- She's alright? Hi. - Hi

07:48.040 --> 07:49.660
Yeah. Okay, go

07:49.870 --> 07:52.750
You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?

07:52.920 --> 07:54.670
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint

07:54.880 --> 07:57.880
And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?

07:58.090 --> 08:01.710
That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.300
Brown, actually

08:03.510 --> 08:05.300
Well, Ms. Brown

08:05.510 --> 08:08.140
It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got

08:08.350 --> 08:10.890
I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace

08:11.100 --> 08:13.270
we'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals

08:13.480 --> 08:14.310
Rehearse that much?

08:14.480 --> 08:16.310
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime

08:16.480 --> 08:18.560
- I can see that. - I'd like to show you firsthand

08:18.770 --> 08:20.810
All I want is the serious answer

08:21.020 --> 08:23.020
Okay, here is serious. My old man had a philosophy:

08:23.190 --> 08:25.780
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."

08:25.990 --> 08:28.030
That's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks

08:28.200 --> 08:30.910
My father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project

08:31.120 --> 08:33.330
A lot of people, including your professors at Brown

08:33.540 --> 08:34.910
would call that being a hero

08:35.120 --> 08:37.120
And a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering

08:37.330 --> 08:38.710
Tell me, do you plan to report

08:38.910 --> 08:41.420
on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology?

08:41.630 --> 08:44.090
Or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?

08:44.290 --> 08:47.510
All those breakthroughs: military funding, honey

08:47.920 --> 08:50.920
Wow, did you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?

08:51.090 --> 08:53.720
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you

09:06.810 --> 09:08.650
Good morning. It's 7 a.m

09:08.820 --> 09:12.280
The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds

09:12.490 --> 09:15.320
The surf conditions are fair with waist to shoulder highlines

09:15.490 --> 09:18.280
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m

09:35.550 --> 09:38.760
Tony? Hey, Tony!

10:01.280 --> 10:03.870
- You are not authorized to access this area. - Jesus!

10:04.070 --> 10:06.580
That's Jarvis, he runs the house

10:06.790 --> 10:09.200
I've got your clothes here, they've been dry cleaned and pressed

10:09.410 --> 10:11.410
And there's a car waiting for you outside

10:11.620 --> 10:13.620
that will take you anywhere you'd like to go

10:14.000 --> 10:17.710
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am

10:18.880 --> 10:22.510
After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry cleaning?

10:23.090 --> 10:26.140
I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires

10:26.340 --> 10:30.100
Including occasionally taking out the trash. Would that be all?

10:47.450 --> 10:49.240
Give me the exploded view

10:49.450 --> 10:52.200
The compression in cylinder 3 appears to be low

10:52.910 --> 10:54.700
Note that

10:57.620 --> 10:59.620
- I'll try again later... - Please don't turn down my music

10:59.750 --> 11:01.040
I'll keep you posted

11:01.250 --> 11:03.340
You are supposed to be half way around the world right now

11:03.540 --> 11:05.130
- How did she take it? - Like a champ

11:05.340 --> 11:06.800
Might've tried to hustle me out of here

11:06.960 --> 11:08.800
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago

11:08.970 --> 11:10.800
That's funny... I thought with it being my plane and all

11:11.010 --> 11:12.300
that it would just wait for me to get there

11:12.510 --> 11:14.930
I need to speak to you about couple of things before I get you outta the door

11:15.140 --> 11:17.720
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the purpose of having your own plane

11:17.930 --> 11:19.220
if it departs before you arrive?

11:19.430 --> 11:22.020
Larry called, he's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock

11:22.190 --> 11:24.350
in the wings, do you want it, yes or no?

11:24.560 --> 11:27.070
Is it a good representation of his Spring Period?

11:27.270 --> 11:29.690
No the "Springs" is actually the neighborhood in East Hampton

11:29.900 --> 11:32.490
where he lived and worked, not "spring" like the season

11:32.700 --> 11:34.700
I think it's a fair example...

11:35.030 --> 11:37.490
I think it's incredibly overpriced

11:37.820 --> 11:40.200
I need it. Buy it, store it

11:41.240 --> 11:43.540
Okay... the MIT commencement speech

11:43.750 --> 11:46.000
Is in June... please, don't harangue me about that stuff

11:46.210 --> 11:48.960
Well, they are haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes...

11:49.170 --> 11:51.840
I need you to sign this before you get on the plane

11:52.000 --> 11:53.960
What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?

11:54.170 --> 11:56.670
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans

11:56.880 --> 11:58.880
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday

11:59.090 --> 12:02.260
- It's your birthday. - Yes. - I knew that. Already?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.640
Yeah, isn't that strange, it's the same day as last year

12:06.060 --> 12:09.190
- Well, get yourself something nice from me. - I already did

12:09.390 --> 12:11.600
- And? - Oh, it was very nice

12:12.480 --> 12:15.570
Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark

12:15.860 --> 12:18.440
You're welcome, Ms. Potts

12:40.840 --> 12:44.550
You're good! I thought I've lost you back there

12:44.720 --> 12:46.760
You did, sir

12:47.260 --> 12:50.260
- I took it across Mojave. - Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha

12:50.470 --> 12:52.680
- What's wrong with you? - What?

12:52.890 --> 12:55.520
- Three hours! - I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair

12:55.730 --> 12:57.940
Three hours. For three hours, you got me standing here

12:58.190 --> 13:00.820
I'm waiting on you now. Lets go. C'mon

13:01.020 --> 13:03.440
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

13:11.200 --> 13:13.580
- What're you reading? - Nothing

13:13.790 --> 13:16.040
C'mon, sourpatch, don't be mad

13:16.250 --> 13:18.710
I told you I'm not mad, I'm indifferent, okay?

13:18.920 --> 13:20.710
- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark

13:20.920 --> 13:22.750
- No need to apologize. - I told him I was sorry but he...

13:22.960 --> 13:24.340
I'm just indifferent right now

13:24.550 --> 13:27.010
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me

13:27.210 --> 13:28.630
- I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter

13:28.840 --> 13:30.840
and so, when you need your diaper changed, thank you...

13:31.050 --> 13:33.180
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

13:33.390 --> 13:35.850
Hey, heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me

13:36.060 --> 13:38.560
I'm not talking... we're not drinking, we're working right now

13:38.770 --> 13:42.230
And you are constitutionally incapable of being responsible

13:42.480 --> 13:44.060
It would be irresponsible not to drink

13:44.230 --> 13:46.060
- I'm just talking about the night cup. - Hot sake?

13:46.230 --> 13:47.610
- Yes, two please. - No, just...

13:47.820 --> 13:49.820
I'm not drinking, I don't want any

13:50.030 --> 13:52.860
That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning

13:53.070 --> 13:55.990
and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize?

13:56.240 --> 14:00.080
I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform

14:00.290 --> 14:03.580
- will get my back! - Here we go again. I'm not like you

14:03.790 --> 14:07.210
No, you don't have to be like me. But you're more than... yes you are

14:07.330 --> 14:09.290
Will you excuse me, I'm a little bit distracted here

14:09.500 --> 14:12.710
No, you can't be distracted right now. Listen to me!

14:16.510 --> 14:19.550
BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN

14:28.850 --> 14:29.940
General

14:30.150 --> 14:31.650
Welcome, Mr. Stark

14:32.150 --> 14:34.980
We look forward to your weapons presentation

14:36.610 --> 14:39.240
Is it better to be feared or respected?

14:39.450 --> 14:42.860
And I say, is it too much to ask for both?

14:43.660 --> 14:46.450
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

14:46.660 --> 14:49.450
of Stark Industries freedom line. It's the first missile system

14:49.660 --> 14:52.580
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology

14:52.920 --> 14:56.540
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire

14:56.840 --> 14:58.710
I respectfully disagree

14:58.920 --> 15:02.800
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once

15:03.010 --> 15:06.720
That's how dad did it, that's how America does it...

15:06.930 --> 15:09.220
and it's worked out pretty well so far

15:09.430 --> 15:12.100
Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain

15:12.310 --> 15:14.020
and I personally guarantee you

15:14.230 --> 15:17.440
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves

15:36.200 --> 15:39.960
For your consideration, the Jericho

15:51.470 --> 15:54.800
We throw one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more

15:55.010 --> 15:56.510
To peace!

15:57.430 --> 15:59.310
- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.850
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How did it go?

16:02.060 --> 16:04.270
Went great, looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas

16:04.480 --> 16:07.520
Hey, way to go, my boy. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

16:07.730 --> 16:09.690
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

16:09.820 --> 16:11.400
Good night, Tony

16:12.490 --> 16:13.650
Hey Tony!

16:13.860 --> 16:17.160
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there

16:17.490 --> 16:20.120
- Nice job. - See you back at base

17:26.800 --> 17:29.060
I wouldn't do that if I were you

18:05.630 --> 18:08.050
What the hell did you do to me?

18:08.340 --> 18:10.380
What I did?

18:10.680 --> 18:12.680
What I did is to save your life

18:12.890 --> 18:16.310
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left

18:16.470 --> 18:19.020
and it's headed into your atrial septum

18:19.180 --> 18:21.020
Here, wanna see?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.400
I have a souvenir. Take a look

18:27.190 --> 18:29.400
I've seen many wounds like that in my village

18:29.610 --> 18:31.610
We call them the walking dead

18:32.030 --> 18:35.030
Because in takes about a week for the balls to reach the vital organs

18:35.240 --> 18:38.200
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet

18:38.700 --> 18:40.740
Hooked up to a car battery

18:40.910 --> 18:44.410
And it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart

18:52.130 --> 18:54.420
That's right. Smile!

18:55.880 --> 18:57.470
We met once, you know

18:57.680 --> 18:59.930
At the technical conference in Bern

19:00.260 --> 19:02.970
- Don't remember. - No, you wouldn't

19:03.310 --> 19:06.520
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand

19:06.730 --> 19:09.770
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits

19:09.980 --> 19:11.810
Where are we?

19:13.110 --> 19:15.320
Come on, stand up. Stand up

19:16.400 --> 19:18.070
Do as I do

19:18.360 --> 19:20.360
C'mon, put your hands up

19:22.450 --> 19:24.450
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

19:24.660 --> 19:26.660
Do you understand me? Do as I do

19:46.970 --> 19:49.220
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark

19:49.430 --> 19:53.060
the most famous mass murderer in the history of America."

19:56.600 --> 19:58.150
He is honored

20:00.610 --> 20:02.980
He wants you to build a missile

20:03.690 --> 20:06.320
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated

20:09.740 --> 20:11.410
This one

20:15.950 --> 20:17.620
I refuse

20:27.630 --> 20:28.840
Tony!

21:18.720 --> 21:21.300
He wants to know what you think

21:21.970 --> 21:24.470
I think he got a lot of my weapons

21:32.770 --> 21:37.030
He says they have everything you need to build a Jericho missile

21:37.360 --> 21:40.110
He wants you to make the list of materials

21:43.280 --> 21:45.870
He says for you to start working immediately

21:46.080 --> 21:48.580
and when you're done, he will set you free

21:52.420 --> 21:53.920
No, I won't

21:54.130 --> 21:55.630
No, he won't

22:08.470 --> 22:11.020
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark

22:11.310 --> 22:14.430
But they will never find you in these mountains

22:15.940 --> 22:17.310
Look...

22:18.610 --> 22:22.440
What you just saw... that is your legacy, Stark

22:24.070 --> 22:27.490
Your life's work in the hands of those murderers

22:27.700 --> 22:29.950
Is that how you want to go out?

22:30.490 --> 22:35.500
Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?

22:36.210 --> 22:38.370
Or are you going to do something about it?

22:38.580 --> 22:41.580
Why should I do anything? They're gonna kill me, you...

22:42.290 --> 22:45.420
Either way, if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week

22:46.710 --> 22:50.720
Well then... this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

22:53.600 --> 22:55.680
If this is gonna be my workstation

22:55.890 --> 22:57.970
I want it well lit, I want all of these tools

22:58.180 --> 23:00.690
Welding gear, I don't care if it's acetylene or propane

23:00.850 --> 23:02.810
I need a soldering station, I need helmets

23:03.020 --> 23:04.940
I need goggles, I would like a smelting cup

23:05.110 --> 23:07.480
I need two sets of precision tools

23:19.700 --> 23:21.620
How many languages do you speak?

23:21.830 --> 23:24.870
A lot. But apparently not enough for this place

23:25.080 --> 23:28.500
They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto

23:28.840 --> 23:31.090
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian

23:31.500 --> 23:33.090
Who are these people?

23:33.300 --> 23:36.380
They are your loyal customers, sir

23:36.550 --> 23:39.390
They call themselves The Ten Rings

23:48.350 --> 23:50.400
You know, we might be more productive

23:50.610 --> 23:53.610
- if you include me in the planning process? - Aha

24:01.200 --> 24:03.240
Okay. We don't need this

24:05.280 --> 24:06.790
What is that?

24:08.290 --> 24:11.920
That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6

24:12.120 --> 24:15.130
so why don't you go break down the other eleven

24:17.130 --> 24:19.130
What are they doing?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.340
Working

24:31.350 --> 24:34.230
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this

24:34.560 --> 24:37.060
Relax, I've steady hands

24:37.900 --> 24:40.480
Why do you think you're still alive, huh?

24:46.700 --> 24:48.700
What do I call you?

24:48.990 --> 24:52.580
- My name is Yinsen. - Yinsen... nice to meet you

24:53.700 --> 24:55.700
Nice to meet you too

25:34.360 --> 25:38.030
Wow, that doesn't look like a Jericho missile

25:38.330 --> 25:41.120
That's because it is a miniaturized Arc reactor

25:41.870 --> 25:44.670
We got a big one powering my factory at home

25:44.870 --> 25:47.670
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart

25:47.880 --> 25:49.670
But what could it generate?

25:49.880 --> 25:52.460
If my math is right, and it always is...

25:52.670 --> 25:54.590
three gigajoules per second

25:54.760 --> 25:58.430
- That could run your heart for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah

25:58.720 --> 26:01.010
Or something big for 50 minutes

26:09.690 --> 26:12.270
- This is our ticket outta here. - What is it?

26:14.070 --> 26:16.650
'Flying the mountain' look

26:22.490 --> 26:23.990
Impressive

26:49.180 --> 26:50.970
Shesh Besh

26:52.180 --> 26:55.190
Good roll. Good roll

26:55.600 --> 26:57.600
You still didn't tell me where you're from

26:57.770 --> 27:00.320
I'm from a small town called Gulmira

27:00.520 --> 27:02.820
It's actually a nice place

27:03.030 --> 27:05.530
- You got a family? - Yes

27:05.950 --> 27:09.200
And I will see them when I leave here

27:09.410 --> 27:11.410
And you, Stark?

27:14.830 --> 27:15.870
Nothing

27:16.960 --> 27:18.000
No

27:19.170 --> 27:23.500
So you're a man who has everything... and nothing

28:09.380 --> 28:12.210
Doesn't look anything like the photo

28:12.420 --> 28:14.130
Maybe he modified it

28:14.300 --> 28:17.340
- The tail doesn't seem right. - Well, too bad

29:02.380 --> 29:03.930
Relax

29:12.680 --> 29:17.860
The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology

29:20.230 --> 29:23.030
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

29:23.320 --> 29:26.530
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine

29:27.360 --> 29:30.530
An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great

29:32.080 --> 29:35.290
And four times the size of the Roman empire

29:39.210 --> 29:41.210
But today

29:41.420 --> 29:44.960
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

29:45.920 --> 29:47.920
rules these lands

29:50.050 --> 29:52.090
And soon...

29:54.260 --> 29:56.350
...it will be my turn

30:09.190 --> 30:11.150
Why did you fail me?

30:11.650 --> 30:14.780
We're working on it. Diligently

30:15.200 --> 30:17.240
I spared your life

30:19.370 --> 30:21.410
Is this how you repay me?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.330
It's very complex

30:24.750 --> 30:26.880
We're trying hard

30:27.290 --> 30:29.090
On your knees

30:33.090 --> 30:35.050
You think I'm an idiot?

30:35.430 --> 30:37.050
Tell me the truth

30:37.430 --> 30:39.510
We are working hard

30:46.060 --> 30:47.810
Open your mouth

30:48.020 --> 30:51.020
- What does he want? - You think I'm a fool?

30:54.860 --> 30:56.650
What is going on?

30:56.940 --> 30:59.200
Tell me the truth

30:59.990 --> 31:01.750
We are working on Jericho

31:01.780 --> 31:02.560
Tell me the truth

31:02.600 --> 31:04.120
We are working on Jericho

31:04.120 --> 31:06.330
What do you want, a delivery date?

31:13.710 --> 31:15.210
I need him

31:17.550 --> 31:19.550
He's a good assistant

31:23.840 --> 31:25.840
You have till tomorrow...

31:26.180 --> 31:28.180
...to assemble my missile

32:32.450 --> 32:33.910
- Okay? - Yes

32:34.110 --> 32:35.410
Can you move?

32:35.660 --> 32:37.160
Say it again

32:37.370 --> 32:39.200
41 steps straight ahead

32:39.370 --> 32:41.580
then 16 steps, left from the door, four to the right

32:41.790 --> 32:43.580
33 steps, turn right

32:50.750 --> 32:52.550
Where is Stark?

32:52.760 --> 32:54.670
He was here a moment ago

32:54.880 --> 32:56.260
Go find him!

33:11.310 --> 33:12.480
Yinsen!

33:12.690 --> 33:14.070
Yinsen! Stark!

33:14.280 --> 33:15.730
Say something

33:15.940 --> 33:17.860
He is speaking Hungarian, I don't...

33:18.070 --> 33:19.860
- Speak Hungarian. - Okay...

33:20.070 --> 33:21.740
What do you know?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.010
- How did that work? - Oh my goodness

33:47.220 --> 33:49.060
- It worked all right. - What do I do?

33:49.220 --> 33:51.980
- Let me finish this. - Finish last powering sequence

33:52.180 --> 33:53.310
Okay

33:53.810 --> 33:55.690
Now! Tell me, tell me!

33:55.900 --> 33:58.570
F 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar

33:58.730 --> 34:00.480
It should be up right now

34:00.690 --> 34:02.690
- Talk to me, tell me when you see it. - I have it

34:02.900 --> 34:04.190
- Press Ctrl + I. - Got it

34:04.400 --> 34:07.450
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over here and button me up

34:11.870 --> 34:13.950
They are coming!

34:14.160 --> 34:16.210
Doesn't need to look pretty, just get it done

34:16.410 --> 34:17.870
They are coming

34:19.290 --> 34:22.040
Make sure that checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, OK?

34:22.250 --> 34:23.710
We need more time

34:24.710 --> 34:25.840
Okay

34:26.550 --> 34:28.170
I'm gonna go buy you some time

34:28.340 --> 34:29.760
Stick to the plan!

34:30.760 --> 34:32.470
Stick to the plan!

34:33.890 --> 34:35.350
Yinsen!

37:27.750 --> 37:29.800
- Yinsen! - Watch out!

37:45.230 --> 37:46.390
Stark

37:47.690 --> 37:49.730
Come on. We gotta go

37:50.440 --> 37:53.650
Move with me. C'mon, we got a plan, we need to stick to it

37:53.860 --> 37:55.650
This was always the plan, Stark

37:55.860 --> 37:58.860
Come on, you're going to go see your family again

37:59.530 --> 38:02.280
My family is dead

38:02.450 --> 38:04.870
I'm going to see them now, Stark

38:07.040 --> 38:09.370
It's okay. It's okay

38:10.460 --> 38:13.500
I want this. I want this

38:19.550 --> 38:21.550
Thank you for saving me

38:22.890 --> 38:26.180
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life

39:05.970 --> 39:07.220
My turn

40:50.560 --> 40:52.060
Not bad

41:47.570 --> 41:49.360
How was the fun-vee?

41:51.950 --> 41:54.700
Next time you ride with me, okay?

42:25.520 --> 42:27.520
Watch it coming up here

42:29.060 --> 42:32.070
Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them

42:40.160 --> 42:41.660
Your eyes are red

42:41.870 --> 42:43.660
Few tears for your long lost boss?

42:43.870 --> 42:46.700
Tears of joy. I hate job hunting

42:46.910 --> 42:48.750
Yeah, vacation's over

42:49.960 --> 42:51.170
Where to, sir?

42:51.380 --> 42:53.960
- Take us to the hospital, please. - No. - No? Tony...

42:54.170 --> 42:56.800
- You have to go to the hospital. - I don't have to do anything

42:57.010 --> 42:59.630
I was in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do

42:59.840 --> 43:02.050
I want an American cheeseburger...

43:02.510 --> 43:04.140
- ...and the other one... - That's not going to happen

43:04.350 --> 43:06.600
It's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now

43:06.810 --> 43:08.850
Call for a press conference? What on earth for?

43:09.060 --> 43:11.060
Yeah, Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first

43:22.820 --> 43:24.650
Look at this!

43:26.320 --> 43:27.570
Tony!

43:29.870 --> 43:32.040
I thought you'll be in a hospital

43:32.870 --> 43:34.330
Look at you!

43:34.790 --> 43:36.830
Oh, burger, you had to have a burger

43:37.000 --> 43:38.540
Did you get me one of those?

43:38.750 --> 43:40.750
There was only one left, I needed it

43:42.880 --> 43:44.880
Hey, look who's here!

43:50.930 --> 43:52.470
- Ms. Potts? - Yes

43:52.680 --> 43:54.180
May I speak with you for a moment?

43:54.390 --> 43:57.270
I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now

43:57.480 --> 43:59.730
I am not a reporter. I'm agent Phil Coulson

43:59.940 --> 44:01.900
with the Strategic Homeland Intervention

44:02.110 --> 44:03.900
Enforcement and Logistics Division

44:04.110 --> 44:06.900
- That's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it

44:07.110 --> 44:11.110
We've been approached already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...

44:11.320 --> 44:14.870
We are a separate division. With a more specific focus

44:15.070 --> 44:18.290
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape

44:18.620 --> 44:21.410
- I'll put something in a book, shell I? - Thank you

44:26.960 --> 44:29.670
Hey, would it be alright if everyone sat down?

44:29.880 --> 44:32.880
Will you sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...

44:33.170 --> 44:35.220
A little less formal...

44:40.140 --> 44:41.770
What's up with the lovin'?

44:41.970 --> 44:44.480
Don't look at me, I don't know what he's up to

44:44.940 --> 44:47.310
- Good to see you. - Good to see you

44:47.520 --> 44:50.020
I never got to say goodbye to dad

44:50.230 --> 44:52.980
I never got to say goodbye to my father

44:56.610 --> 44:58.660
There's questions that I would've asked him

44:58.860 --> 45:02.120
I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did...

45:02.530 --> 45:05.490
...if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts

45:06.500 --> 45:10.290
Or maybe he was every inch of a man we all remember from the newsreels

45:14.960 --> 45:17.800
I saw young Americans killed...

45:18.170 --> 45:22.510
...by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them

45:23.510 --> 45:26.970
And I saw that I had become part of a system

45:27.220 --> 45:30.520
that is comfortable with zero-accountability

45:33.690 --> 45:35.520
What happened over there?

45:36.060 --> 45:37.860
I had my eyes opened

45:38.020 --> 45:41.320
I came to realize that I have more to offer

45:41.530 --> 45:44.570
this world than just making things that blow up

45:44.740 --> 45:48.030
And that is why, effective immediately, I'm shutting down

45:48.240 --> 45:51.580
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International...

45:52.080 --> 45:54.500
...untill such a time, as I can decide

45:54.710 --> 45:56.710
what the future of this company will be

45:56.920 --> 45:59.590
what direction it should take, the one I'm comfortable with

45:59.790 --> 46:03.630
and is consistent with the highest good of this country and the world

46:04.960 --> 46:07.800
What we should take away from this...

46:07.970 --> 46:09.970
...is that Tony's back!

46:10.390 --> 46:12.800
And he's healthier than ever

46:13.140 --> 46:16.310
We are gonna have a little internal discussion

46:16.520 --> 46:19.350
and we'll get back to you with a follow-up

46:20.980 --> 46:23.230
- Where is he? - He's inside

46:34.320 --> 46:36.700
That... that went well

46:36.910 --> 46:39.410
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

46:39.620 --> 46:41.580
Your head? What about my head?

46:41.790 --> 46:45.040
What do you think the over-under on a stock drop is gonna be?

46:45.250 --> 46:48.250
- Optimistically? 40 Points? - At minimum

46:49.920 --> 46:52.760
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer

46:52.970 --> 46:55.640
Obie, I just... I don't want the body count to be up...

46:55.840 --> 46:58.600
That's what we do. We're iron mongers, we make weapons

46:58.760 --> 47:00.600
My name is on facade of the building

47:00.760 --> 47:02.890
What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos

47:03.100 --> 47:04.770
Not based on what I saw

47:05.310 --> 47:06.770
We're not doing a good enough job

47:06.980 --> 47:08.560
We can do better, we're gonna do something else

47:08.650 --> 47:11.520
Oh, like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

47:12.280 --> 47:15.650
I think we should take another look into Arc Reactor technology

47:15.860 --> 47:19.450
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

47:19.660 --> 47:23.030
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

47:23.240 --> 47:26.450
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project

47:26.950 --> 47:30.420
The Arc was never cost-effective. We knew that before we built it

47:30.620 --> 47:33.380
Arc Reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

47:33.590 --> 47:35.510
- Maybe. - Am I right?

47:35.550 --> 47:38.590
We haven't had a breakthrough in that, in what... 30 years

47:38.800 --> 47:40.760
That's what they say

47:42.760 --> 47:44.550
Could you have a lousier poker face?

47:44.760 --> 47:46.970
- Just tell me, who told you? - Never mind who told me

47:47.180 --> 47:48.720
- Show me. - Rhodey or Pepper

47:48.890 --> 47:50.890
- I wanna see it. - Okay, Rhodey

48:04.070 --> 48:05.570
It works

48:09.370 --> 48:11.410
Listen to me, Tony

48:11.790 --> 48:13.660
We are a team, do you understand?

48:13.870 --> 48:16.370
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together

48:16.580 --> 48:18.210
like your father and I

48:18.420 --> 48:21.250
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads up, okay? But if I had...

48:21.460 --> 48:25.050
- Tony, no more of this 'ready - fire - aim' business

48:25.260 --> 48:27.880
- Do you understand me? - That was dad's line

48:28.510 --> 48:30.430
You gotta let me handle this

48:30.640 --> 48:33.010
We're gonna have to play whole different kind of ball now

48:33.220 --> 48:35.020
We're gonna have to take a lot of heat

48:35.220 --> 48:38.310
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low

48:38.600 --> 48:43.060
Stark Industries. I've got one recommendation. Ready, ready?

48:43.730 --> 48:45.070
Sell, sell, sell!

48:45.270 --> 48:47.070
Abandon ship!

48:47.400 --> 48:50.320
Does the 'Hindenburg' ring any bells?

48:51.700 --> 48:55.910
Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!

48:58.160 --> 49:02.000
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!

49:02.710 --> 49:05.540
Pepper! How big are your hands?

49:05.750 --> 49:08.250
- What? - How big are your hands?

49:08.460 --> 49:11.300
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you

49:18.510 --> 49:19.640
Hey!

49:21.520 --> 49:23.600
Let's see them. Show me your hands

49:23.850 --> 49:25.310
Let's see them

49:25.640 --> 49:28.440
Oh, wow, they are small. Very petite, indeed

49:28.650 --> 49:31.070
I just need your help for a sec

49:31.860 --> 49:34.360
Oh my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

49:34.570 --> 49:36.780
It was, it is now an antique

49:37.360 --> 49:40.320
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future

49:40.530 --> 49:42.530
I was swapping it up for an upgraded unit

49:42.740 --> 49:45.080
and I just ran into a little... speed bump

49:45.250 --> 49:46.790
Speed bump? What's happening?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.580
It's nothing, it's just a little snag

49:48.750 --> 49:51.170
There's an exposed wire under this device

49:51.380 --> 49:53.040
and is contacting a socket wall

49:53.250 --> 49:55.250
and is causing a little bit of a short circuit

49:57.210 --> 49:58.510
What do you want me to do?

49:58.720 --> 50:01.180
Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant

50:01.380 --> 50:02.840
I just want you to reach in...

50:03.050 --> 50:05.550
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out

50:06.310 --> 50:07.600
Is it safe?

50:07.810 --> 50:09.640
Yeah, it should be fine. It's just like an operation

50:09.810 --> 50:11.310
you just don't let it touch the socket wall

50:11.520 --> 50:14.230
- What's Operation? - It's just a game, never mind

50:14.440 --> 50:18.070
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay. - Okay? Great

50:20.150 --> 50:22.690
You know, I don't think that I am qualified to do this

50:22.900 --> 50:25.450
No, no, you're fine. You're the most capable

50:25.660 --> 50:28.740
qualified and trustworthy person I've ever met

50:28.950 --> 50:30.740
You're gonna do great

50:31.540 --> 50:35.210
Is it too much of a problem to ask? Cause I really need your help here

50:42.090 --> 50:44.050
- Oh, there's pus! - It's not pus

50:44.260 --> 50:49.010
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from the device, not from my body

50:49.300 --> 50:51.390
- It smells! - Yeah, it does

50:52.050 --> 50:53.680
The copper wire

50:53.890 --> 50:56.140
- The copper wire, you got it? - I got it

50:56.350 --> 50:57.770
Now don't let it touch...

50:58.230 --> 51:01.230
...the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before

51:01.560 --> 51:03.440
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out

51:03.610 --> 51:05.940
you don't pull out the magnet and the end of it. That was it...

51:06.150 --> 51:09.150
- ...that you just pulled out. - Oh God. OK, what do I do?

51:09.400 --> 51:11.450
- Don't put it back in! - What's wrong?

51:11.610 --> 51:13.740
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest cause you yanked out...

51:13.950 --> 51:17.160
- What? I thought you said this was safe! - We gotta hurry

51:17.200 --> 51:19.620
- Take this, you gotta switch, real quick. - Okay, okay

51:20.000 --> 51:24.210
Tony, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay

51:25.500 --> 51:28.040
You gotta touch that to base plate

51:28.250 --> 51:30.050
And make sure you...

51:33.840 --> 51:35.220
Was that so hard?

51:35.430 --> 51:37.850
That was fun, right? I got it, I got it

51:38.510 --> 51:39.510
Nice

51:39.720 --> 51:41.850
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great

51:42.060 --> 51:43.680
Are you okay?

51:44.810 --> 51:47.230
Don't ever, ever...

51:47.400 --> 51:50.400
...ever ask me to do anything like that ever again

51:50.820 --> 51:53.230
I don't have anyone but you

51:58.450 --> 51:59.860
Are we ready?

52:05.290 --> 52:07.460
What do you want me to do with this?

52:07.870 --> 52:11.540
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it

52:12.960 --> 52:14.790
You don't wanna keep it?

52:14.960 --> 52:16.800
Pepper, I've been called many things

52:17.010 --> 52:18.800
Nostalgic is not one of them

52:19.340 --> 52:22.970
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark? - That would be all, Ms. Potts

52:23.680 --> 52:25.510
Hey butterfingers, come here

52:25.680 --> 52:27.890
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?

52:28.100 --> 52:30.600
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad...

52:30.810 --> 52:33.810
Right there. In garbage. All that stuff

52:40.070 --> 52:42.110
The future of air combat

52:42.450 --> 52:44.570
Is it manned or unmanned?

52:44.860 --> 52:48.740
I tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle

52:48.910 --> 52:51.740
will ever trump a pilot's instinct

52:52.120 --> 52:55.160
his insight - that ability to look into a situation

52:55.370 --> 52:58.290
beyond the obvious and discern its outcome

52:58.500 --> 53:00.090
Or pilot's judgement

53:00.290 --> 53:02.920
- Colonel, it's... - why not a pilot without a plane?

53:03.130 --> 53:05.510
Look who fell outta the sky! Mr. Tony Stark

53:05.720 --> 53:07.220
Speaking about manned or unmanned

53:07.430 --> 53:09.010
you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong

53:09.220 --> 53:10.680
It's spring break, just remember that

53:10.890 --> 53:14.310
Spring break 1987, that lovely lady, what was his name?

53:14.520 --> 53:15.720
Was it Ivan?

53:15.930 --> 53:18.310
Don't do that, they'll believe it. Don't do that

53:18.520 --> 53:21.190
Give us a couple of minutes, you guys

53:24.520 --> 53:25.980
- I'm surprised. - Why?

53:26.190 --> 53:28.740
I swear I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon

53:28.950 --> 53:30.910
I'm doing a little better than walking

53:31.110 --> 53:32.530
- Really? - Yeah

53:33.200 --> 53:35.580
Rhodey, I'm working on something big

53:35.830 --> 53:39.040
I came to talk to you. I want you to be part of it

53:39.750 --> 53:43.370
You're about to make a whole lotta people around here real happy

53:43.540 --> 53:47.210
cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was juicy

53:47.840 --> 53:52.050
This is not for the military. I'm not... it's different

53:52.260 --> 53:55.050
What, are you humanitarian now or something?

53:55.260 --> 53:56.970
I need you to listen to me

53:57.180 --> 54:00.600
No, what you need is time to get your mind right

54:02.220 --> 54:03.980
I'm serious

54:06.690 --> 54:08.650
It was nice seeing you, Tony

54:08.860 --> 54:10.520
Thanks

54:18.530 --> 54:21.660
- Jarvis, are you up? - For you sir, always

54:21.990 --> 54:25.660
I'd like to open a new project file, index as: Mark 2

54:27.000 --> 54:30.380
Shell I store this on the Stark Industries' central database?

54:31.040 --> 54:33.710
I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice

54:33.880 --> 54:36.550
why don't we just keep everything on my private server

54:36.760 --> 54:39.420
Working on a secret project, are we, sir?

54:43.140 --> 54:45.760
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands

54:48.270 --> 54:51.060
Maybe in mine it could actually do some good

55:33.890 --> 55:35.180
Next

55:36.180 --> 55:37.390
Up

55:37.600 --> 55:40.350
Not the boot, Dummy, right here. You got me?

55:40.560 --> 55:42.440
Stay put. Nice

55:43.940 --> 55:46.820
And you, you're no better at it at all. Lift... I got it

55:48.570 --> 55:50.700
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

55:57.490 --> 55:58.490
Up

55:59.500 --> 56:02.120
That's great, don't even move

56:02.500 --> 56:05.040
You... are a tragedy

56:14.550 --> 56:16.760
Okay, lets do this right

56:17.430 --> 56:20.560
Start mark, half meter back of the center

56:23.180 --> 56:25.520
Dummy, look for light. Stand back for fire safety

56:25.690 --> 56:27.520
You, roll it

56:31.860 --> 56:33.860
Activate hand controls

56:37.240 --> 56:39.030
We are gonna start up nice and easy

56:39.240 --> 56:41.450
raising 10% thrust capacity to achieve lift

56:41.950 --> 56:45.950
And 3, 2, 1

57:24.240 --> 57:26.490
Up two? Alright, step back

57:26.700 --> 57:28.830
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?

57:28.990 --> 57:30.620
Yeah, everything's... what?

57:30.830 --> 57:33.790
- Obadiah's upstairs. - Great, I'll be right up

57:36.370 --> 57:38.540
I thought you said you were done making weapons?

57:38.750 --> 57:41.590
It isn't. This is a flight stabilizer

57:41.800 --> 57:43.670
It's completely harmless

57:47.630 --> 57:49.470
I didn't expect that

57:54.100 --> 57:55.720
How'd it go?

57:57.770 --> 57:59.730
Oh, went that bad huh?

57:59.940 --> 58:02.520
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

58:02.730 --> 58:05.940
- doesn't mean it went bad. - Sure doesn't. Oh, boy

58:06.280 --> 58:08.490
It would've gone better if you were there

58:09.450 --> 58:11.820
You told me to lay low and that's what I've been doing

58:12.030 --> 58:13.660
I lay low and you take care of all the...

58:13.870 --> 58:15.870
Hey, c'mon. In public, the press...

58:16.410 --> 58:18.660
This was a Board of Directors meeting

58:18.870 --> 58:21.330
This was a Board of Directors meeting?

58:22.250 --> 58:24.170
The Board is claiming a Post Traumatic Stress

58:24.380 --> 58:26.460
- They are filing an injunction. - A what?

58:26.670 --> 58:28.050
They wanna lock you out

58:28.250 --> 58:30.300
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points? We knew this was gonna happen

58:30.510 --> 58:32.510
- 56 and a half. - It doesn't matter

58:32.680 --> 58:34.800
We own a controlling interest in the company

58:35.010 --> 58:37.550
Tony, the Board has rights too

58:38.100 --> 58:41.680
They are making the case that you and your new direction

58:41.890 --> 58:43.730
isn't in a company's best interest

58:43.940 --> 58:46.020
I'm being responsible. That's a new direction

58:46.230 --> 58:48.060
For me... for the company

58:48.230 --> 58:52.070
I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that...

58:52.400 --> 58:55.700
- Oh, this is great! - Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!

58:55.990 --> 58:58.990
- I'll be in the shop. - Hey, hey, Tony, listen

58:59.280 --> 59:01.280
I'm trying to turn this thing around

59:01.490 --> 59:04.450
but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them

59:04.620 --> 59:07.210
Let me have the engineers analyze that, you know

59:07.410 --> 59:09.210
- draw some specs. - No

59:09.420 --> 59:11.460
No. Absolutely not. This one stays with me

59:11.630 --> 59:13.380
That's it Obie. Forget it

59:13.590 --> 59:15.000
Alright, well this stays with me then

59:15.210 --> 59:18.010
- Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two. - Thank you

59:18.220 --> 59:20.630
Do you mind if I come down there to see what you're doing?

59:20.840 --> 59:22.220
Good night, Obie

59:22.550 --> 59:25.680
Day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0

59:25.890 --> 59:28.720
For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety

59:28.930 --> 59:31.560
If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire

59:31.770 --> 59:34.690
I'm donating you to a city college. Alright, nice and easy

59:34.980 --> 59:39.610
Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity

59:41.400 --> 59:43.200
And 3, 2, 1

59:57.920 --> 59:59.960
Please don't follow me around with it either cause I feel

1:00:00.170 --> 1:00:02.590
like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.460
If something happens, then come in

1:00:04.630 --> 1:00:07.840
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%. 3, 2, 1...

1:00:23.940 --> 1:00:26.280
Okay, this is where I don't want to be

1:00:27.030 --> 1:00:28.900
Not the car, not the car

1:00:41.710 --> 1:00:43.710
It could be worse. We are fine

1:00:45.750 --> 1:00:47.880
Okay, we are getting there

1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:09.440
Yeah. I can fly

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:16.240
- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir

1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:19.030
- Engage head up display. Check

1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:21.660
Import all preferences from home interface

1:01:21.830 --> 1:01:23.240
Will do, sir

1:01:29.290 --> 1:01:31.250
Alright, what do you say?

1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:34.050
I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready

1:01:34.250 --> 1:01:36.090
Start the virtual walkaround

1:01:36.300 --> 1:01:39.090
Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment

1:01:39.300 --> 1:01:42.180
- Do a check on control surfaces. - As you wish

1:02:03.910 --> 1:02:07.120
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics

1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:09.740
Ah, yes... tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check

1:02:09.950 --> 1:02:11.450
Start listening the ground control

1:02:11.620 --> 1:02:14.160
Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed

1:02:14.370 --> 1:02:16.330
- before an actual flight. - Jarvis...

1:02:16.540 --> 1:02:19.170
Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk

1:02:19.340 --> 1:02:23.170
Ready? And 3, 2, 1

1:02:46.650 --> 1:02:48.700
It feels like a dream

1:03:16.630 --> 1:03:18.580
Alright, lets see what this thing can do

1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:20.410
What's the SR-71's record?

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:24.060
The altitude record for fixed-wing flight is 85.000 feet, sir

1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:26.710
Records are made to be broken. C'mon!

1:03:30.370 --> 1:03:33.850
Sir, there is a potentially fatal build-up of ice occurring

1:03:34.020 --> 1:03:35.450
Keep going!

1:03:36.890 --> 1:03:38.410
Higher!

1:03:52.630 --> 1:03:55.110
We're iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps

1:03:55.850 --> 1:03:57.330
Jarvis?

1:03:59.330 --> 1:04:01.540
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!

1:04:36.980 --> 1:04:38.420
Cut power

1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:06.030
Note: main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:08.200
The whole pressurization is problematic

1:06:08.420 --> 1:06:10.640
I'm thinking 'icy' is a probable factor

1:06:10.810 --> 1:06:13.730
A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps if you intend to visit

1:06:13.900 --> 1:06:16.070
other planets, we should improve the exo systems

1:06:16.290 --> 1:06:18.810
Connect to the Cisco, have it reconfigure the shell metals

1:06:19.030 --> 1:06:21.860
Use the gold-titanium alloy from the Seraphim tactical satellite

1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:24.250
That should ensure the fuselage integrity

1:06:24.470 --> 1:06:26.680
while maintaining power -to-weight ratio. Got it?

1:06:26.860 --> 1:06:29.680
Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?

1:06:29.900 --> 1:06:31.380
Thrill me

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:34.550
Tonight's red hot, red carpeted,

1:06:34.590 --> 1:06:36.730
right here at the Disney Concert Hall,

1:06:36.950 --> 1:06:39.730
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for

1:06:39.950 --> 1:06:42.950
the Firefighters Family Fund has become the place to be...

1:06:43.210 --> 1:06:44.950
Jarvis, did we get an invite from them?

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:47.510
I have no record of the invitation, sir

1:06:47.950 --> 1:06:49.820
...haven't been seen in public

1:06:49.990 --> 1:06:52.950
since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.

1:06:53.170 --> 1:06:55.770
Some claim he's suffering from PTS and has been

1:06:55.990 --> 1:06:58.690
bed ridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,

1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:01.860
no one expects an appearance from him tonight.

1:07:02.300 --> 1:07:03.730
The render is complete

1:07:04.250 --> 1:07:06.300
Little ostentatious, don't you think?

1:07:06.510 --> 1:07:09.560
What was I thinking? You're usually so discrete

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:13.780
Tell you what... throw a little hot rot red in there

1:07:13.950 --> 1:07:16.380
Yes, that shall help you keep a low profile

1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:21.820
The render is complete

1:07:22.170 --> 1:07:24.170
Yeah, I like it. Fabricate it and paint it

1:07:24.340 --> 1:07:25.990
Commencing an automated assembly

1:07:26.210 --> 1:07:28.430
Estimated completion time is five hours

1:07:28.990 --> 1:07:31.040
Don't wait up for me, honey

1:07:54.300 --> 1:07:56.080
The weapons manufacturing is...

1:07:56.300 --> 1:07:59.690
only a one small part of what Stark Industries is all about...

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:07.650
- Hey Tony, remember me? - I sure don't

1:08:08.650 --> 1:08:10.470
You look great, Hef

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:16.870
What's the world coming to when a guy's gotta crash his own party?

1:08:17.390 --> 1:08:19.000
Look at you!

1:08:20.170 --> 1:08:22.870
- Hey, what a surprise! - I'll see you inside

1:08:24.910 --> 1:08:26.910
Listen, take it slow, alright?

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:29.220
I got the Board where I really want them

1:08:29.430 --> 1:08:32.130
You got it. Just cabin fever, I'll just be a minute

1:08:36.870 --> 1:08:39.000
Give me a Scotch, I'm starving

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000
- Mr. Stark? - Yeah?

1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:45.260
- Agent Coulson. - Oh yeah, the guy from the...

1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:47.220
Strategic Homeland Intervention

1:08:47.390 --> 1:08:49.390
Enforcement and Logistics Division

1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:51.430
God, you got... you need a new name for that

1:08:51.610 --> 1:08:53.220
Yeah, I hear that a lot

1:08:53.650 --> 1:08:55.870
Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you

1:08:56.090 --> 1:08:57.650
but we need to debrief you

1:08:57.870 --> 1:08:59.870
There's still a lot of unanswered questions

1:09:00.090 --> 1:09:01.870
and time can be a factor with these things

1:09:02.090 --> 1:09:03.870
Lets just put something on the books

1:09:04.090 --> 1:09:07.090
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m. at Stark Industries?

1:09:07.780 --> 1:09:10.830
Tell you what... you got it. You're absolutely right

1:09:11.130 --> 1:09:15.350
Well... I'm gonna go to my assistant and we'll make it date

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:18.960
You look fantastic, I didn't recognise you

1:09:19.180 --> 1:09:21.390
- What are you doing here? - Avoiding government agents

1:09:21.570 --> 1:09:24.000
- Are you here by yourself? - Where'd you get that dress?

1:09:24.180 --> 1:09:26.440
It was a birthday present from you, actually

1:09:26.610 --> 1:09:28.610
- I have great taste. - Yes

1:09:28.790 --> 1:09:31.960
- You, uh, wanna dance? - Oh, no, thank you. No

1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:45.700
Am I making you uncomfortable?

1:09:46.090 --> 1:09:47.480
No, no

1:09:48.090 --> 1:09:50.180
I always forget to wear a deodorant

1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:52.700
and dance with my boss in front of everyone

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:54.790
that I work with, in a dress with no back

1:09:55.610 --> 1:09:58.130
- You look great, you smell great. - Oh, God

1:09:58.310 --> 1:10:00.480
But I could fire you, if that'd take the edge off

1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:03.740
I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me

1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:05.350
I'd make it a week

1:10:05.570 --> 1:10:08.350
Really? What's your social security number?

1:10:11.660 --> 1:10:13.310
- Five. - Five?

1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:17.790
You're missing just a couple of digits there

1:10:18.010 --> 1:10:22.010
The other eight? That's why I got you, for the other eight

1:10:33.830 --> 1:10:36.880
- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air

1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:40.920
- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless

1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:43.530
It was totally not harmless, by the way

1:10:43.700 --> 1:10:46.830
- Nobody was watching us. - Everybody who I work with...

1:10:47.050 --> 1:10:50.010
I think you lost objectivity. I think they... we just danced

1:10:50.230 --> 1:10:52.050
No, it was not just the dance!

1:10:52.270 --> 1:10:54.050
You don't understand because you're you

1:10:54.270 --> 1:10:57.490
And everybody knows exactly who you are, and how you are with girls

1:10:57.700 --> 1:10:59.970
And all that, which is completely fine...

1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:03.360
But you know, then me, you're my boss and I'm dancing...

1:11:03.570 --> 1:11:06.880
Because it makes me look like... the one who's trying to...

1:11:07.050 --> 1:11:09.530
I just think you're overstating, that's all

1:11:09.750 --> 1:11:13.570
And we're here, and then I'm... wearing this ridiculous dress...

1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:17.050
And then we were dancing like that and...

1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:32.450
- I would like a drink, please. - Got it

1:11:34.490 --> 1:11:37.140
I would like a vodka martini, please

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.060
Very dry with olives, lot of olives

1:11:40.270 --> 1:11:42.270
like at least three olives

1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:46.140
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast

1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:47.970
Make one of them dirty

1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:56.490
- Well... Tony Stark! - Oh, hey!

1:11:56.750 --> 1:11:58.530
Fancy seeing you here

1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:04.060
- Carrie. - Christine. - That's right

1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:06.800
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight

1:12:07.100 --> 1:12:09.190
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

1:12:09.410 --> 1:12:11.190
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction

1:12:11.410 --> 1:12:13.190
I was referring to your company's involvement

1:12:13.410 --> 1:12:15.280
- in this latest atrocity. - They just put my name

1:12:15.450 --> 1:12:16.440
on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you

1:12:16.510 --> 1:12:19.320
I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker

1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:21.800
I was out of town for a couple of months, in case you didn't hear

1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:23.360
Is this what you call accountability?

1:12:23.710 --> 1:12:26.750
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

1:12:38.100 --> 1:12:40.890
- When were these taken? - Yesterday

1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:43.490
- I didn't approve any shipment. - Well, your company did

1:12:43.670 --> 1:12:45.500
Well, I'm not my company

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:49.100
- Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures?

1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:52.840
- What's going on? - Tony, you can't afford to be this naive

1:12:53.060 --> 1:12:55.060
I was naive before, when they said:

1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:57.840
Here's the line, we don't cross it, this is how we do business

1:12:58.060 --> 1:13:01.190
If we're double-dealing under the table... are we?

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:08.060
Let's take a picture. Come on

1:13:08.450 --> 1:13:09.930
Picture time!

1:13:11.850 --> 1:13:14.630
Tony... who do you think locked you out?

1:13:14.850 --> 1:13:18.110
I was the one who filed the injunction against you

1:13:20.370 --> 1:13:22.850
It's the only way I can protect you

1:13:35.110 --> 1:13:37.890
The fifteen miles hike to the outskirts of Gulmira

1:13:38.110 --> 1:13:40.980
can only be described as a 'descent into Hell'.

1:13:41.150 --> 1:13:43.370
Into a modern day heart of darkness.

1:13:43.590 --> 1:13:46.150
Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages

1:13:46.370 --> 1:13:48.200
have been driven from their homes

1:13:48.410 --> 1:13:50.410
displaced from their lands by warlords,

1:13:50.630 --> 1:13:52.410
emboldened by a newfound power.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:54.760
Villagers have been forced to take shelter

1:13:54.940 --> 1:13:56.980
in whatever ways that they can find.

1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:58.940
In the ruins of other villages

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:02.330
or here, in the remnants of the old Soviet smelting plant.

1:14:07.370 --> 1:14:10.460
Recent violence has been attributed to a group

1:14:10.490 --> 1:14:13.540
of foreign fighters, referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:16.980
As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.980
A mission that can prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way.

1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:24.240
With no political will or international pressure,

1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:26.630
there's very little hope for these refugees.

1:14:26.850 --> 1:14:29.850
Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband

1:14:30.070 --> 1:14:32.070
who was kidnapped by insurgents.

1:14:32.290 --> 1:14:33.850
Either forced to join their militia...

1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:42.200
...to anyone who will stop a child's simple question:

1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:44.900
"Where are my mother and father?"

1:14:46.070 --> 1:14:48.550
There's very little hope for these refugees,

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:52.680
refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.

1:16:25.420 --> 1:16:26.640
Faster!

1:16:26.860 --> 1:16:29.120
Women on the trucks! The weapons here!

1:16:29.340 --> 1:16:31.510
Abandon houses! Hurry up!

1:16:39.730 --> 1:16:41.470
Hold this rebel!

1:16:43.690 --> 1:16:45.900
Put him with the others

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:52.640
Father!

1:16:56.820 --> 1:16:58.430
What the hell is this?

1:17:09.730 --> 1:17:11.470
Kill this bastard!

1:17:11.910 --> 1:17:13.560
You are incompetent!

1:17:16.780 --> 1:17:18.300
Turn your head!

1:17:19.780 --> 1:17:21.430
Father!

1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:26.300
He is all yours

1:19:23.050 --> 1:19:24.740
AIR BASE EDWARDS, CALIFORNIA

1:19:24.870 --> 1:19:26.740
- What the hell was that? - Are we clear to go in there?

1:19:26.920 --> 1:19:28.130
No, sir. They were using human shields

1:19:28.350 --> 1:19:29.570
We never got the green light

1:19:29.790 --> 1:19:31.830
Department of State, they're gonna be all over this

1:19:32.790 --> 1:19:34.440
We got a bogey

1:19:34.610 --> 1:19:36.480
Is CIA on the line?

1:19:36.700 --> 1:19:38.790
I got them on line, they wanna know if it's us

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:40.480
No, that definitely is not us, sir

1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:42.480
- It wasn't navy. - Wasn't marines

1:19:42.660 --> 1:19:45.270
I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?

1:19:46.570 --> 1:19:47.870
Get me colonel Rhodes

1:19:48.090 --> 1:19:50.480
from the Weapons development down here now!

1:19:56.050 --> 1:19:57.920
We ran an ID check and crossed reference

1:19:58.090 --> 1:19:59.920
with all known databases. We have nothing

1:20:00.140 --> 1:20:01.920
Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?

1:20:02.140 --> 1:20:03.920
We've got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area

1:20:04.140 --> 1:20:05.610
So this things just appeared out of nowhere?

1:20:05.830 --> 1:20:07.350
How come it didn't show up on the Radar?

1:20:07.530 --> 1:20:09.310
It's got a minimum Radar cross-section, sir

1:20:09.530 --> 1:20:11.350
- Is it stealth? - No, sir. It's tiny

1:20:11.570 --> 1:20:13.700
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle

1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:16.440
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:20.310
I'm gonna make a call

1:20:25.010 --> 1:20:26.490
- Hello? - Tony?

1:20:26.700 --> 1:20:28.440
- Who is this? - It's Rhodes

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:29.790
Sorry, hello?

1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:31.830
- I said it's Rhodes. - Speak up, please

1:20:31.970 --> 1:20:35.180
- What the hell is that noise? - I'm driving with the top down

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:37.100
Yeah, well I need your help right now

1:20:37.310 --> 1:20:38.920
It's funny how that works, huh?

1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:41.180
Yeah, speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot

1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:43.270
that was just blown up a few cliques from where

1:20:43.490 --> 1:20:45.270
- you've been held captive. - Well, that's a hot spot

1:20:45.490 --> 1:20:48.100
Sounds like someone stepped in and did you job for you

1:20:48.270 --> 1:20:49.970
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

1:20:50.180 --> 1:20:52.180
- I was just jogging at the canyon. - I thought you were driving

1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:54.360
Right, I was driving to the canyon where I'm gonna jog

1:20:54.580 --> 1:20:56.360
Are you sure you don't have any tech in that area...

1:20:56.580 --> 1:20:57.790
- ...I should know about? - Nope

1:20:57.970 --> 1:20:59.620
Bogey spotted!

1:20:59.790 --> 1:21:01.880
Okay, good, cause I'm staring at one right now

1:21:02.100 --> 1:21:04.310
and it's about to be blown to kingdom come

1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:15.050
War room, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sight

1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:18.400
- Whiplash One, what is it? - I've got no idea

1:21:18.490 --> 1:21:20.580
- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir

1:21:20.790 --> 1:21:22.580
Then you are clear to engage

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:32.450
Bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!

1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:39.060
- Incoming missile. - Flairs!

1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:44.190
Wait a second! Bogey deployed flairs

1:21:58.670 --> 1:22:00.100
Deploy flaps!

1:22:01.450 --> 1:22:03.840
Holly... this thing just drove off the Radar, sir!

1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:05.840
Satellite image has been lost

1:22:06.060 --> 1:22:08.410
- No way that's the U.A.V. - What is it?

1:22:08.620 --> 1:22:10.450
I can't see anything

1:22:10.670 --> 1:22:13.150
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm

1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:15.620
I think bogey has been handled, sir

1:22:25.540 --> 1:22:27.630
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me. - It's who?

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:30.710
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked what that was, and it was me

1:22:30.890 --> 1:22:33.630
No, see.. this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment

1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:36.230
into my active war zone. You understand that?

1:22:36.450 --> 1:22:39.890
It's not a piece of equipment. I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:42.230
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1:22:44.110 --> 1:22:47.320
- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that

1:22:49.540 --> 1:22:52.630
On your belly! It looks like a... man!

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.450
Shake him off! Move, move!

1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:05.500
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1:23:11.370 --> 1:23:13.150
Eject! Eject!

1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:21.590
Whiplash One down

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:25.190
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute? - Negative! No chute! No chute!

1:23:31.110 --> 1:23:33.150
My chute's jammed!

1:23:37.850 --> 1:23:40.150
Sir, I've got a visual on a bogey

1:23:40.410 --> 1:23:43.890
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it!

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:48.150
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. Call off the Raptors

1:23:48.410 --> 1:23:51.370
That thing just took out an F-22 inside the legal no-fly zone

1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:53.500
Whiplash 2, if you have a clear shot, take it

1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.200
They've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver

1:23:56.410 --> 1:23:57.590
Keep going!

1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:07.460
Got a chute! Got a chute!

1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:17.500
- Tony, are you still there? - Hey, thanks

1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:20.500
Oh my God, you crazy son of a bitch!

1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:23.070
You owe me a plane, you know that, right?

1:24:24.030 --> 1:24:26.630
Yeah, well, technically he hit me, so...

1:24:26.850 --> 1:24:29.590
- Now are you gonna come by and see what I'm working on? - No, no

1:24:29.770 --> 1:24:31.370
The less I know the better

1:24:31.590 --> 1:24:33.590
Now what am I supposed to tell to the press?

1:24:33.770 --> 1:24:35.720
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:37.720
It's not that simple

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:40.110
An unfortunate training exercise

1:24:40.330 --> 1:24:43.160
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday

1:24:43.370 --> 1:24:46.420
I'm pleased to report that the pilot was not injured

1:24:47.030 --> 1:24:50.850
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira

1:24:51.070 --> 1:24:54.590
it is still unclear who or what intervened

1:24:54.770 --> 1:24:58.590
but I can assure you that the U.S. government was not involved

1:25:03.770 --> 1:25:06.460
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:09.810
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt

1:25:09.990 --> 1:25:11.980
Be gentle, this is my first time

1:25:12.550 --> 1:25:14.510
I designed this to come off

1:25:18.990 --> 1:25:21.030
Please try not to move

1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:24.200
What's going on here?

1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:32.070
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing

1:25:33.380 --> 1:25:35.640
Are those bullet holes?

1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:04.470
Welcome

1:26:07.380 --> 1:26:09.900
Compliments of Tony Stark

1:26:10.290 --> 1:26:13.860
If you killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face

1:26:14.030 --> 1:26:16.290
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince

1:26:16.510 --> 1:26:18.550
Show me the weapon

1:26:19.380 --> 1:26:22.770
Come. Leave your guards outside

1:26:39.510 --> 1:26:42.510
His escape bore unexpected fruit

1:26:44.730 --> 1:26:46.990
So this is how he did it

1:26:47.430 --> 1:26:51.640
This is only a first crude effort. Stark has perfected his design

1:26:52.470 --> 1:26:55.650
He has made a masterpiece of death

1:26:55.820 --> 1:26:59.300
A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia

1:27:00.470 --> 1:27:03.860
And you dream of Stark's throne

1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:07.040
We have a common enemy

1:27:11.260 --> 1:27:13.730
We are still in business

1:27:15.650 --> 1:27:17.910
I will give you these designs...

1:27:19.390 --> 1:27:21.080
...as a gift

1:27:21.950 --> 1:27:23.990
And in return...

1:27:25.170 --> 1:27:29.910
...I hope you repay me with a gift of iron soldiers

1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:44.300
This is the only gift you will receive

1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:48.820
Technology

1:27:50.430 --> 1:27:54.390
That's always been your Achilles heel in this part of the world

1:27:55.300 --> 1:27:58.780
Don't worry. It will only last for 15 minutes

1:27:59.430 --> 1:28:02.520
That's the least of your problems

1:28:07.170 --> 1:28:10.040
Bring the armour and the rest of it

1:28:11.430 --> 1:28:13.820
Alright, lets finish up here

1:28:17.390 --> 1:28:20.170
Set up Sector 16 underneath the Arc reactor

1:28:20.350 --> 1:28:24.000
And I want this dead and masked. Recruit our top engineers

1:28:24.170 --> 1:28:26.220
I want a prototype right away

1:28:35.090 --> 1:28:36.520
Are you busy?

1:28:37.220 --> 1:28:40.700
I need you to go to my office and hack into the mainframe

1:28:40.910 --> 1:28:43.960
You're gonna retrieve all the recent shipping manifests

1:28:44.130 --> 1:28:46.700
This is a lock chip, this will get you in

1:28:46.910 --> 1:28:49.350
It's probably under Executive Files, if not...

1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:51.910
they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look

1:28:52.130 --> 1:28:53.830
for the lowest numeric heading

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.310
And what do you plan to do with this information

1:28:56.520 --> 1:28:57.910
- if I bring it back here? - Same drill

1:28:58.090 --> 1:29:00.310
They've been dealing under the table, I'm gonna stop them

1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:03.440
I'm gonna find my weapons and destroy them

1:29:03.870 --> 1:29:05.480
Tony...

1:29:07.180 --> 1:29:10.000
you know that I would help you with anything

1:29:10.180 --> 1:29:13.260
but I can not help you if you're gonna start all of this again

1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:16.830
There is nothing except this. There's no art openings

1:29:17.050 --> 1:29:20.440
there's no benefit, there's nothing to sign

1:29:21.350 --> 1:29:24.870
There's the next mission, and nothing else

1:29:26.050 --> 1:29:28.090
Is that so?

1:29:29.310 --> 1:29:31.350
Well, then I quit

1:29:33.610 --> 1:29:35.570
You stood by my side all these years

1:29:35.790 --> 1:29:38.270
while I reaped the benefits of destruction

1:29:38.610 --> 1:29:40.610
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1:29:40.790 --> 1:29:42.610
that I've put in harm's way, your going to walk out?

1:29:42.790 --> 1:29:46.790
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony. I'm not gonna be a part of it

1:29:47.310 --> 1:29:51.530
I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason

1:29:53.440 --> 1:29:55.480
I'm not crazy, Pepper

1:29:55.700 --> 1:29:58.960
I just finally know what I have to do

1:30:03.090 --> 1:30:06.620
And I know in my heart that it's right

1:30:21.790 --> 1:30:24.230
You're all I have too, you know

1:31:33.670 --> 1:31:35.670
Sector 16?

1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:38.840
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1:31:51.410 --> 1:31:54.360
You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill

1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:56.880
was the great Tony Stark. As you can see

1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:00.060
Obadiah Stane, your deception and lies will cost you dearly

1:32:00.230 --> 1:32:03.190
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up

1:32:07.230 --> 1:32:11.060
So... what are we gonna do about this?

1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:26.710
I know what you're going through, Pepper

1:32:34.540 --> 1:32:38.060
Ah, Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he?

1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:01.720
I was so happy...

1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:07.320
when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead

1:33:09.980 --> 1:33:12.110
And now I realise...

1:33:14.410 --> 1:33:18.280
...well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1:33:19.060 --> 1:33:22.150
He left a part of himself in that cave

1:33:24.670 --> 1:33:26.720
Breaks my heart

1:33:28.330 --> 1:33:29.630
Well...

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:33.020
He is a complicated person

1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:39.070
He's been through a lot. I think he'll be alright

1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:48.200
You are a very rare woman

1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:52.890
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is

1:33:55.020 --> 1:33:57.240
Thank you. Thanks

1:33:59.330 --> 1:34:01.330
I gotta get back there

1:34:06.590 --> 1:34:08.980
Is that today's paper?

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:11.500
Yes

1:34:12.110 --> 1:34:14.940
- Do you mind? - Not at all

1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:17.460
- Puzzle. - Of course

1:34:20.810 --> 1:34:22.680
Take care

1:34:46.030 --> 1:34:47.900
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment

1:34:47.980 --> 1:34:49.940
Did you forget about our appointment?

1:34:50.110 --> 1:34:52.850
Nope. Right now, come with me

1:34:54.900 --> 1:34:57.940
I'll give you the meeting of your life. Your office

1:34:58.990 --> 1:35:01.550
We've been working our best

1:35:02.070 --> 1:35:05.120
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna have to call you back

1:35:05.770 --> 1:35:08.940
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us

1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:11.990
and it seems as though there's a little hiccup, actually...

1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:14.510
- A hiccup? - Yes, to power the suit...

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:17.120
sir, the technology actually doesn't exist. So it's...

1:35:17.380 --> 1:35:19.380
Wait, wait, the technology?

1:35:19.860 --> 1:35:23.070
William, here is the technology

1:35:23.550 --> 1:35:26.030
I've asked you to simply make it smaller

1:35:26.250 --> 1:35:28.600
Okay, sir, that's what we're trying to do

1:35:28.810 --> 1:35:30.810
but honestly, it's impossible

1:35:30.990 --> 1:35:34.290
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1:35:34.810 --> 1:35:37.210
With a box of scraps!

1:35:38.810 --> 1:35:42.290
I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark

1:35:57.990 --> 1:35:59.380
Tony?

1:36:01.770 --> 1:36:03.600
Tony, are you there?

1:36:06.820 --> 1:36:08.160
Breathe

1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:11.510
Easy, easy...

1:36:14.030 --> 1:36:16.640
You remember this one, right?

1:36:17.730 --> 1:36:20.250
It's a shame the government didn't approve

1:36:20.470 --> 1:36:24.340
There are so many applications regarding short-term paralysis

1:36:26.250 --> 1:36:27.900
Ah, Tony

1:36:30.470 --> 1:36:34.470
When I ordered the hit on you

1:36:37.250 --> 1:36:39.910
I was worried that I was...

1:36:42.820 --> 1:36:45.560
...killing the golden goose

1:36:46.430 --> 1:36:48.470
But, you see...

1:36:49.250 --> 1:36:53.300
it was just fate that you survived it

1:36:58.820 --> 1:37:02.650
leaving one last golden egg to give

1:37:06.950 --> 1:37:10.430
You really think that just because you have an idea

1:37:10.650 --> 1:37:12.650
it belongs to you?

1:37:15.950 --> 1:37:20.210
Your father, he helped to give us the atomic bomb

1:37:20.390 --> 1:37:23.390
Now what kind of world would it be today

1:37:23.610 --> 1:37:25.600
if he was as selfish as you?

1:37:35.430 --> 1:37:37.520
Oh, it's beautiful

1:37:39.870 --> 1:37:41.470
Ah, Tony...

1:37:42.870 --> 1:37:45.390
This is your Ninth Symphony

1:37:46.740 --> 1:37:49.610
What a masterpiece! Look at that

1:37:50.610 --> 1:37:52.820
This is your legacy

1:37:55.040 --> 1:37:57.870
The generation of weapons...

1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:00.950
...with this at its heart

1:38:03.260 --> 1:38:07.090
The weapons that will help stir the world back on course

1:38:07.300 --> 1:38:10.090
With the balance of power in our hands

1:38:11.090 --> 1:38:13.130
In the right hands

1:38:15.910 --> 1:38:20.390
I wish you could see my prototype

1:38:21.910 --> 1:38:27.090
It's not as... not as conservative as yours

1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:32.300
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this

1:38:32.870 --> 1:38:35.440
I would've preferred that she lived

1:38:48.390 --> 1:38:50.480
What do you mean he paid to have Tony killed?

1:38:50.700 --> 1:38:52.520
Pepper, slow down

1:38:52.740 --> 1:38:55.830
Why would Obadiah... okay, where is Tony now?

1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.220
I don't know, he's not answering his phone

1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:00.570
Please go there and make sure everything's okay

1:39:00.740 --> 1:39:03.220
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut

1:40:09.140 --> 1:40:10.750
Good boy

1:40:50.270 --> 1:40:51.450
Tony?

1:40:54.010 --> 1:40:55.580
Tony?

1:40:56.930 --> 1:40:58.270
Tony?

1:41:03.970 --> 1:41:05.230
Tony!

1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:11.100
- Are you okay? - Where is Pepper?

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:15.540
She's fine. She's with five agents that are about to arrest Obadiah

1:41:16.140 --> 1:41:18.140
That's not gonna be enough

1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:43.930
Section 16

1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:46.580
Section 16...

1:41:47.230 --> 1:41:48.750
There it is

1:41:57.100 --> 1:41:59.540
My key's not working, it's not opening the door

1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:02.230
Wow, what is that? It's like a little device, like a thing

1:42:02.450 --> 1:42:05.710
- that's gonna pick the lock? -You may wanna take few steps back

1:42:25.020 --> 1:42:28.280
- That's the coolest thing I've ever seen. - Not bad, huh?

1:42:29.630 --> 1:42:31.240
Let's do it

1:42:37.190 --> 1:42:39.500
You need me to do anything else?

1:42:39.930 --> 1:42:41.890
Keep the skies clear

1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:48.190
Damn!

1:42:55.980 --> 1:42:57.980
Next time, baby

1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:29.850
Looks like you were right

1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:31.850
He was building a suit

1:43:32.070 --> 1:43:34.020
I thought it'll be bigger

1:44:18.850 --> 1:44:20.290
Take him out!

1:44:30.590 --> 1:44:33.070
How do you think the Mark One chest piece is gonna hold up?

1:44:33.250 --> 1:44:35.110
48% power and falling, sir

1:44:35.330 --> 1:44:38.290
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight

1:44:38.510 --> 1:44:40.070
Keep me posted

1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:42.810
- Pepper. - Tony?

1:44:43.030 --> 1:44:44.940
- Tony, are you okay? - I'm fine

1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:47.420
- Obadiah, he's gone insane. - I know. Listen!

1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:49.810
- You better get outta there! - He built the suit

1:44:50.030 --> 1:44:51.460
Get outta there, right now!

1:45:02.550 --> 1:45:04.940
Where do you think you're going?

1:45:10.550 --> 1:45:13.200
Your services are no longer required

1:45:13.940 --> 1:45:15.200
Stane!

1:45:40.470 --> 1:45:42.990
- I love this suit! - Put them down

1:45:43.210 --> 1:45:45.510
Collateral damage, Tony

1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:49.030
Defer the power to chest piece

1:45:57.900 --> 1:46:00.030
Power reduced to 19%

1:46:07.430 --> 1:46:08.730
Lady!

1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:38.470
For thirty years, I've been holding you up

1:46:42.300 --> 1:46:45.170
I built this company from nothing!

1:46:46.910 --> 1:46:49.820
And nothing is gonna stand in my way

1:46:55.780 --> 1:46:58.300
And least of all, you

1:47:07.870 --> 1:47:10.740
Impressive! You upgraded your armour

1:47:10.950 --> 1:47:13.950
I've made some upgrades of my own

1:47:22.210 --> 1:47:24.210
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly

1:47:24.430 --> 1:47:26.480
Duly noted. Take me to the maximum altitude

1:47:26.650 --> 1:47:29.080
With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that altitude...

1:47:29.300 --> 1:47:31.260
I know the math! Do it!

1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.690
Sir, you're not gonna believe this. That thing is back

1:47:41.870 --> 1:47:44.260
Get me major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1:47:46.740 --> 1:47:50.000
Not necessary, people, just the training exercise

1:47:59.390 --> 1:48:01.650
- 13% power, sir. - Climb!

1:48:05.310 --> 1:48:07.480
-11%. - Keep going!

1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:17.480
- 7% power. - Just leave it on the screen, stop telling me

1:48:27.570 --> 1:48:29.130
You had a great idea, Tony

1:48:29.350 --> 1:48:32.130
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1:48:32.350 --> 1:48:34.700
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1:48:34.830 --> 1:48:36.440
Icing problem?

1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:40.350
Might want to look into it

1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:53.830
2%

1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:58.960
We are now running on emergency backup power

1:49:10.350 --> 1:49:11.660
- Potts! - Tony!

1:49:11.870 --> 1:49:13.920
Oh my God, are you okay?

1:49:14.090 --> 1:49:17.140
I'm almost dead of power, I gotta get out of this thing

1:49:17.310 --> 1:49:20.050
- I'll be right there. - Nice try

1:49:32.350 --> 1:49:34.140
Weapons status?

1:49:34.350 --> 1:49:36.570
Repulsors are off line

1:49:40.620 --> 1:49:42.010
Flairs!

1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:53.010
Very clever, Tony

1:49:58.050 --> 1:49:59.920
- Potts. - Tony!

1:50:00.140 --> 1:50:02.750
This isn't working, we're gonna have to overload the reactor

1:50:02.970 --> 1:50:05.620
- and blast the roof. - How are you gonna do that?

1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:07.050
You're gonna do it

1:50:07.270 --> 1:50:09.270
Go to the central console, open up bolt of circuits

1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:11.270
When I clear the roof I'll let you know

1:50:11.490 --> 1:50:13.660
and you're gonna hit the master bypass button

1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:16.140
That's gonna fry everything up here

1:50:17.310 --> 1:50:19.100
Okay, I am going in now

1:50:19.310 --> 1:50:23.180
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof, I'll buy you some time

1:50:32.530 --> 1:50:34.710
This looks important

1:50:55.010 --> 1:50:58.060
I never had a taste for this sort of thing

1:50:58.270 --> 1:51:02.100
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit

1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:13.620
You finally outdid yourself, Tony

1:51:15.450 --> 1:51:18.190
It would've made your father proud

1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.140
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:45.750
Tony!

1:51:46.890 --> 1:51:48.890
How ironic, Tony!

1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:52.890
Trying to free the world of weapons

1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:55.360
you gave it the best one ever!

1:51:55.580 --> 1:51:57.760
- Pepper! - And now...

1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:01.670
I'm gonna kill you with it!

1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:06.970
You ripped up my targeting system

1:52:07.150 --> 1:52:09.970
- Hit the button! - You told me not to!

1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:12.370
Hold still, you little prick

1:52:14.370 --> 1:52:16.930
- Just do it! - You'll die!

1:52:20.190 --> 1:52:21.580
Push it!

1:53:18.890 --> 1:53:20.410
Tony!

1:53:29.020 --> 1:53:31.070
We've all received the official statement

1:53:31.290 --> 1:53:33.890
of what occurred at Stark Industries last night

1:53:34.110 --> 1:53:37.500
There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype

1:53:37.680 --> 1:53:40.890
malfunctioned and caused damage to the Arc reactor

1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:46.460
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy. It's got a nice ring to it

1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:49.720
It's not technically accurate, since it's a gold-titanium alloy

1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:52.550
but it's kinda attractive name anyway

1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:54.550
Here is your alibi

1:53:55.550 --> 1:53:57.980
- Okay. - You were on your yacht

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:00.500
We told Pepper to put you in Avalon all night

1:54:00.680 --> 1:54:02.940
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests

1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:06.110
I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1:54:06.330 --> 1:54:08.110
alone on the island

1:54:09.110 --> 1:54:12.460
That's what happened. Just read it word for word

1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:16.420
There's nothing about Stane here

1:54:16.590 --> 1:54:19.420
That's been handled. He's on vacation

1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:22.720
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record

1:54:22.940 --> 1:54:25.640
What about this whole story that it's a body guard?

1:54:25.850 --> 1:54:28.330
He's my body... ? That's kinda flimsy

1:54:28.510 --> 1:54:30.810
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark

1:54:31.030 --> 1:54:34.590
Just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you

1:54:34.900 --> 1:54:37.250
You've got 90 seconds

1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:41.900
Oh, agent Coulson

1:54:42.330 --> 1:54:46.330
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help

1:54:46.730 --> 1:54:49.900
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us

1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:53.510
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D

1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:55.160
Right

1:54:55.940 --> 1:54:59.070
- Lets get the show on the road. - You know, it's actually...

1:54:59.290 --> 1:55:02.200
...not that bad... even I don't think I'm Iron Man

1:55:02.340 --> 1:55:04.210
- You're not Iron Man. - Yeah I am

1:55:04.380 --> 1:55:06.200
- You're not. - Suite yourself

1:55:06.510 --> 1:55:08.900
If I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend

1:55:09.070 --> 1:55:11.510
who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck

1:55:11.730 --> 1:55:14.120
She'd always be worrying that I was gonna die

1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:16.770
and yet proud of a man I become. She'd be...

1:55:16.950 --> 1:55:20.120
wildly conflicted, which would only make her more...

1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:24.030
crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night?

1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:26.210
- What night? - You know

1:55:28.730 --> 1:55:32.380
Are you talking about... the night that we danced

1:55:32.990 --> 1:55:35.550
and went up to the roof...

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.550
and then...

1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:42.600
you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you...

1:55:43.430 --> 1:55:45.770
left me there by myself?

1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:48.640
Is that the night you're talking about?

1:55:50.990 --> 1:55:52.770
I thought so

1:55:54.730 --> 1:55:58.430
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts

1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:01.730
And now Mr. Stark has prepared a statement

1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:05.250
He will not be taking any questions, thank you

1:56:08.470 --> 1:56:11.510
It's been a while since I was in front of you

1:56:11.730 --> 1:56:14.510
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time

1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:18.510
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events

1:56:18.730 --> 1:56:20.730
that occurred on a freeway and the rooftop...

1:56:20.950 --> 1:56:24.040
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1:56:24.170 --> 1:56:27.210
that was a bodyguard in a suit, that conveniently appeared

1:56:27.390 --> 1:56:30.250
- despite the fact that... - I know that it's confusing...

1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:33.380
It is one thing to question the official story

1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:35.780
and another entirely to make wild accusations

1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:37.780
or insinuate that I'm a superhero

1:56:37.990 --> 1:56:40.430
- I never said you're a superhero. - You didn't?

1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:43.650
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and...

1:56:43.950 --> 1:56:45.650
...fantastic

1:56:48.130 --> 1:56:51.690
I'm just not the hero type, clearly. With this...

1:56:52.210 --> 1:56:55.040
long list of character defects and all the mistakes I've made

1:56:55.210 --> 1:56:57.080
largely in public

1:56:57.690 --> 1:57:00.300
- Just stick to the cards. - Yeah, okay

1:57:02.430 --> 1:57:04.300
The truth is...

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.520
I am Iron Man

2:05:14.410 --> 2:05:18.060
- Jarvis? - Welcome home, sir

2:05:21.290 --> 2:05:23.130
I am Iron Man

2:05:24.380 --> 2:05:26.710
You think you're the only Superhero in the world?

2:05:27.240 --> 2:05:31.930
We are part a bigger universe, yet we know nothing

2:05:32.450 --> 2:05:34.010
Who the hell are you?

2:05:35.060 --> 2:05:37.140
Nick Fury, the Director of SHIELD

2:05:38.190 --> 2:05:39.230
Oh

2:05:39.750 --> 2:05:42.360
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative
