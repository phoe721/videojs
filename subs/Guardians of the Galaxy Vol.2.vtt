01:06.692 --> 01:10.282
There's a girl in this harbor town

01:10.445 --> 01:13.485
And she works layin' whiskey down

01:14.116 --> 01:17.906
They say,
"Brandy, fetch another round"

01:18.078 --> 01:21.118
And she serves them
whiskey and wine

01:21.290 --> 01:25.250
The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"

01:25.419 --> 01:29.259
"What a good wife you would be"

01:40.309 --> 01:42.099
-Come on!
-Slow down!

01:42.269 --> 01:44.269
This way, my river lily! Come on!

01:47.065 --> 01:48.315
Where are you taking me?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.403
Come on, come on.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.780
Look. Look!

01:51.945 --> 01:53.855
Oh, it's beautiful!

01:54.031 --> 01:56.121
I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...

01:56.283 --> 01:57.533
but it rooted quickly.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.371
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.537
All across the universe.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.885
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

02:07.044 --> 02:08.674
but I like the way you say it.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.589
My heart is yours...

02:11.632 --> 02:13.342
Meredith Quill.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.756
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.530
Showtime, a-holes!

03:13.235 --> 03:15.455
It will be here any minute.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.412
Which will be its loss.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.073
I thought your thing was a sword?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.281
We've been hired
to stop an interdimensional beast...

03:21.451 --> 03:23.831
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.369
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.250
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.748
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

03:32.921 --> 03:34.261
It hurts.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.303
It hurts?

03:37.009 --> 03:38.589
I have sensitive nipples.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.348
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

03:42.514 --> 03:44.104
What about him? What's he doing?

03:44.266 --> 03:46.766
I'm finishing this so we can listen to
tunes while we work.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.185
How is that a priority?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.733
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.438
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.028
That's hardly important right now.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.573
Okay. Sure, Quill.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.657
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

03:59.823 --> 04:03.163
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.504
I can clearly see you winking.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.077
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.261
I am Groot.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.552
They were not looking at you funny.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.934
Well, that's intense.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.243
Groot!

05:42.593 --> 05:44.933
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

05:45.095 --> 05:46.095
Hi.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.805
No! Spit it out!

06:30.974 --> 06:32.144
Come on!

06:35.145 --> 06:36.555
Disgusting!

07:38.250 --> 07:41.040
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.385
I must cut through it from the inside.

07:43.547 --> 07:44.417
Huh?

07:44.590 --> 07:47.050
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

07:47.217 --> 07:48.087
Drax!

07:57.936 --> 07:59.226
What is he doing?

07:59.396 --> 08:02.226
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

08:02.399 --> 08:04.109
-That doesn't make any sense!
-I tried telling him that!

08:04.276 --> 08:06.736
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

08:06.904 --> 08:08.614
I realize that.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.412
There is a cut on its neck.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.788
Rocket, get it to look up.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.881
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

08:30.594 --> 08:32.104
Watch it, Quill!

09:18.976 --> 09:20.976
Yes! I have single-handedly...

09:21.979 --> 09:23.269
vanquished the beast!

09:26.316 --> 09:27.476
What?

09:37.494 --> 09:38.834
What are they called again?

09:39.288 --> 09:40.658
Anulax batteries.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.041
Harbulary batteries.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.498
That's nothing like what I just said.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.379
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

09:47.546 --> 09:49.666
which is why the Sovereign hired us
to protect them.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.220
Careful what you say around these
folks. They're easily offended.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.175
The cost of transgression is death.

09:56.513 --> 10:00.523
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.694
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

10:05.522 --> 10:09.362
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.696
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.033
We control the DNA of our progeny...

10:15.199 --> 10:17.529
germinating them in birthing pods.

10:17.701 --> 10:21.201
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.866
Perhaps someday, you could give me
a history lesson...

10:25.375 --> 10:28.545
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.842
For academic purposes.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.796
I would be honored, yes.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.966
In the name of research...

10:35.135 --> 10:37.635
I think that could be pretty...

10:37.804 --> 10:39.064
repulsive.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.350
I'm not into that kind of casual...

10:41.517 --> 10:42.557
Oh, please.

10:42.726 --> 10:46.016
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.478
Bring it...

10:47.648 --> 10:49.228
and we shall gladly
be on our way.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.585
Family reunion. Yay.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.249
I understand she is your sister.

11:08.418 --> 11:12.708
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

11:13.090 --> 11:17.260
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

11:18.262 --> 11:20.182
Do with her as you please.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.444
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.444
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.233
My mother is from Earth.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.275
And your father?

11:36.780 --> 11:39.780
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.450
I see it within you.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.122
An unorthodox genealogy.

11:45.289 --> 11:49.499
A hybrid that seems particularly...

11:50.460 --> 11:52.090
reckless.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.128
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

11:57.426 --> 11:58.926
but that isn't true at all.

12:03.974 --> 12:04.814
Oh, shit.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.985
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?

12:07.144 --> 12:09.524
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.193
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.108
You're telling me.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.487
You wanna buy some batteries?

12:29.166 --> 12:33.166
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.559
That stuff about my father...

13:27.724 --> 13:29.734
Who does she think she is?

13:29.893 --> 13:32.193
I know you're sensitive about that.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.524
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.243
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.950
I wasn't.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.243
I don't care if you were.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.197
Well, I feel like you do care.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.737
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

13:47.911 --> 13:50.081
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.044
Damn shadow.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.251
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

13:54.418 --> 13:56.128
those who dance, and those who do not.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.255
Mm-hmm.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.423
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

14:00.591 --> 14:01.421
Oh, God.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.552
Everyone in the village flailed about,
dancing.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.390
Except one woman.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.098
My Ovette.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.061
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.766
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.613
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.571
Wouldn't move a muscle.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.455
One might assume she was dead.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.073
That does sound pretty hot.

14:24.615 --> 14:27.245
It would
make my nether regions engorge.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.289
Okay. I get it, yes.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.253
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

14:31.413 --> 14:35.083
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

14:40.464 --> 14:43.304
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.967
No. It's not ripe yet...

14:45.135 --> 14:46.135
and I hate you.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.513
You hate me?

14:47.679 --> 14:50.349
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.676
And yet here you stand, a hero.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.691
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.356
I swear.

14:57.523 --> 14:58.653
No.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.185
You're gonna live out the rest of
your days in a prison on Xandar...

15:02.361 --> 15:03.781
wishing you could.

15:10.661 --> 15:11.661
This is weird.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.538
We've got a Sovereign
fleet approaching from the rear.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.705
Why would they do that?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.503
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.497
Dude!

15:18.168 --> 15:18.998
Right.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.339
He didn't steal some of those.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.214
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.190
What were you thinking?

15:35.352 --> 15:36.642
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

15:36.812 --> 15:38.192
-That's your defense?
-Come on!

15:38.355 --> 15:40.685
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.528
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

15:43.360 --> 15:45.900
I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.531
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

15:48.699 --> 15:50.369
-and they're trying to kill us.
-Exactly!

15:50.534 --> 15:52.164
I was being sarcastic!

15:52.327 --> 15:53.367
Oh, no!

15:53.537 --> 15:55.867
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

15:56.248 --> 15:57.538
Can we put the bickering on hold...

15:57.708 --> 15:59.708
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

15:59.877 --> 16:01.537
-More incoming!
-Good!

16:01.712 --> 16:03.212
I wanna kill some guys!

16:11.054 --> 16:12.394
You're not killing anyone.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.266
All those ships are remotely piloted.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.556
Damn it!

16:29.281 --> 16:31.201
What is the delay, Admiral?

16:31.366 --> 16:35.406
High Priestess, the batteries, they are
exceptionally combustible...

16:35.579 --> 16:36.749
and could destroy the entire fleet.

16:36.914 --> 16:39.624
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.455
We hired them and they steal from us.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.088
It is heresy of the highest order.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.975
All command modules...

16:50.135 --> 16:52.715
fire with the intent to kill.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.935
What's the nearest habitable planet?

17:04.942 --> 17:06.282
It's called Berhert.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.073
-How many jumps?
-Only one.

17:08.237 --> 17:11.317
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

17:11.490 --> 17:14.330
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.962
Quill, to make it through that...

17:25.128 --> 17:26.798
you'd have to be the greatest pilot
in the universe.

17:26.964 --> 17:27.964
Lucky for us, I...

17:28.131 --> 17:29.631
I am.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.152
What are you doing?

17:43.313 --> 17:45.323
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.532
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

17:48.694 --> 17:51.324
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

17:51.822 --> 17:52.822
Stop it.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.660
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

17:54.825 --> 17:56.835
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.374
And you're gonna be like,
"What's this?"

17:58.537 --> 18:00.327
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

18:01.999 --> 18:04.209
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.786
It won't be my turd.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.341
It will be Drax's.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.800
I have famously huge turds.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.337
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

18:17.014 --> 18:18.014
Son of a...

18:18.182 --> 18:19.642
Dude! Seriously!

18:20.350 --> 18:21.350
Hey! Let me...

18:35.699 --> 18:37.029
Idiots!

18:37.201 --> 18:39.081
Well, that's what you get
when Quill flies.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.828
We still have a Sovereign
craft behind us.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.498
Our weapons are down.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.710
20 clicks to the jump!

18:53.884 --> 18:54.724
Hold on.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.233
It's not ripe.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.242
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.544
Yes!

19:23.622 --> 19:25.712
15 clicks to the jump!

19:26.124 --> 19:27.254
Come on!

19:28.043 --> 19:29.593
Keep going!

19:43.809 --> 19:45.019
10 clicks!

19:48.605 --> 19:50.355
Die, spaceship!

19:55.153 --> 19:56.453
You suck, Zylak.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.613
Typical.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.327
Five clicks!

20:07.124 --> 20:08.674
Son of a...

20:09.126 --> 20:10.996
They went around the field!

20:25.309 --> 20:27.639
Someone destroyed all our ships!

20:27.811 --> 20:29.021
What?

20:31.815 --> 20:33.685
Who?

20:34.651 --> 20:36.071
One click!

20:37.237 --> 20:38.987
-What is that?
-Who cares?

20:39.156 --> 20:40.526
That's the jump point! Go!

20:44.203 --> 20:46.003
It's a guy.

20:53.170 --> 20:54.000
Oh, my God.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.551
He's still out there?

21:22.699 --> 21:24.829
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

21:25.619 --> 21:27.999
Prepare for a really bad landing!

22:08.620 --> 22:10.580
That was awesome!

22:12.082 --> 22:13.082
Yes!

22:15.127 --> 22:16.417
Look at this!

22:17.171 --> 22:18.761
Where is the other half of our ship?

22:18.922 --> 22:19.922
My ship.

22:20.090 --> 22:23.720
Either one of you could have gotten us
through that field... Had you flown

22:23.886 --> 22:26.756
with what's between your ears
instead  of what's between your legs!

22:27.347 --> 22:30.177
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

22:30.350 --> 22:32.480
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.272
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.069
More like because he stole...

22:37.232 --> 22:38.442
the Anulax batteries!

22:38.609 --> 22:40.779
They're called Harbulary batteries.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.454
No, they're not!

22:42.779 --> 22:44.489
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

22:45.240 --> 22:46.620
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

22:46.783 --> 22:48.703
I did it because I wanted to!

22:48.869 --> 22:49.619
Dick.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.576
What are we even
talking about this for?

22:51.747 --> 22:54.367
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

22:54.541 --> 22:55.421
How little?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.464
Well, I don't know, like this?

22:57.878 --> 22:59.458
A little one-inch man saved us?

22:59.630 --> 23:01.840
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.297
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

23:04.468 --> 23:05.888
Don't call me a raccoon!

23:06.261 --> 23:08.681
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

23:09.515 --> 23:10.855
I meant trash panda.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.393
Is that better?

23:14.853 --> 23:16.563
I don't know.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.940
It's worse. It's so much worse.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.397
You son of a...

23:20.567 --> 23:21.277
Hey!

23:21.443 --> 23:22.743
-I've had it with you!
-No! Back up!

23:22.903 --> 23:24.653
Someone followed you through
the jump point.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.912
Set me free, you'll need my help.

23:29.076 --> 23:30.156
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.247
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.582
You'll attack me
the moment I let you go.

23:33.747 --> 23:34.747
No, I won't.

23:34.915 --> 23:38.135
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.383
I bet it's the one-inch man.

24:12.244 --> 24:16.044
After all these years, I've found you.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.498
And who the hell are you?

24:19.293 --> 24:22.503
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.879
My name is Ego...

24:27.301 --> 24:28.761
and I'm your dad, Peter.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.702
You know what they say...

24:46.862 --> 24:49.822
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

25:16.558 --> 25:17.978
Yondu!

25:18.685 --> 25:20.685
Come on down!

25:32.324 --> 25:34.494
After going around years in circles...

25:34.660 --> 25:36.450
with this woman I end up marrying.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.330
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

25:39.498 --> 25:40.918
"but you're losing your mind!"

25:41.083 --> 25:43.043
Then again, she's always
been that way.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.960
I could never trust her. You know?

25:45.128 --> 25:46.208
Stakar.

25:50.384 --> 25:52.184
It's been some time.

25:56.223 --> 26:00.233
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

26:06.525 --> 26:07.285
-Sir!
-Stakar!

26:07.442 --> 26:09.782
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

26:09.945 --> 26:12.995
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.656
Please, sir. Please!

26:14.825 --> 26:16.205
Get away from me.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.328
You can go to hell then!

26:24.501 --> 26:26.751
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

26:27.087 --> 26:28.877
So what are you following us for?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.377
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

26:30.549 --> 26:33.339
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!

26:33.510 --> 26:35.350
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

26:35.512 --> 26:38.432
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

26:38.599 --> 26:41.099
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

26:41.268 --> 26:45.608
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.862
You may dress like us...

26:48.025 --> 26:50.535
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

26:50.694 --> 26:52.534
And the Colors of Ogord...

26:52.696 --> 26:56.116
will never flash over your grave.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.699
If you think...

26:59.870 --> 27:03.040
I take pleasure in exiling you...

27:04.791 --> 27:06.541
you're wrong.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.631
You broke all our hearts.

27:26.063 --> 27:27.563
Pathetic.

27:28.732 --> 27:30.732
First, Quill betrays us...

27:30.901 --> 27:34.151
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

27:35.072 --> 27:37.452
We followed him
because he was the one...

27:37.616 --> 27:40.116
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

27:40.285 --> 27:42.615
Seems he's goin' soft.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.580
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

27:46.166 --> 27:47.996
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

27:48.168 --> 27:52.588
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.256
Who the hell is that?

28:34.339 --> 28:36.049
Yondu Udonta...

28:36.633 --> 28:38.893
I have a proposition for you.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.506
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

28:41.680 --> 28:43.720
when your mother passed away.

28:43.891 --> 28:45.731
But instead of returning you...

28:45.893 --> 28:47.643
Yondu kept you.

28:47.811 --> 28:50.521
I have no clue as to why.

28:51.523 --> 28:52.983
Well, I'll tell you why.

28:53.150 --> 28:55.190
Because I was a
skinny little kid who

28:55.277 --> 28:56.317
could squeeze into
places adults couldn't.

28:56.361 --> 28:57.821
It made it easier for thievin'.

28:57.988 --> 29:01.318
Well, I've been trying to track you down
ever since.

29:02.159 --> 29:03.449
I thought Yondu was your father.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.659
What? We've been together
this whole time...

29:05.829 --> 29:08.619
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.000
You look exactly alike.

29:10.167 --> 29:11.837
One's blue!

29:13.462 --> 29:15.132
No, he's not my father!

29:15.297 --> 29:17.717
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

29:17.883 --> 29:19.683
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

29:19.843 --> 29:21.893
and kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

29:22.054 --> 29:23.354
-Eat you?
-Yeah.

29:23.514 --> 29:25.644
That son of a bitch.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.177
How'd you locate us now?

29:27.893 --> 29:30.903
Even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

29:31.063 --> 29:33.573
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

29:33.732 --> 29:36.032
What say we head out there right now?

29:36.193 --> 29:38.403
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

29:39.696 --> 29:40.906
I promise you...

29:41.490 --> 29:43.490
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

29:44.201 --> 29:45.371
And there...

29:45.869 --> 29:49.659
I can explain
your very special heritage.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.714
Finally get to be...

29:52.876 --> 29:55.546
the father I've always wanted to be.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.547
Excuse me.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.379
I've gotta take a whiz.

30:06.557 --> 30:08.387
I'm not buying it.

30:10.561 --> 30:12.231
Let's go take a walk.

30:18.902 --> 30:20.452
I am Mantis.

30:24.241 --> 30:25.741
What are you doing?

30:25.909 --> 30:27.289
Smiling.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.620
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

30:31.707 --> 30:33.747
Not if you do it like that.

30:35.419 --> 30:38.049
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

30:38.213 --> 30:42.933
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

30:45.262 --> 30:48.892
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

30:51.727 --> 30:52.767
Yes.

31:01.987 --> 31:05.777
That is called a practical joke!

31:08.952 --> 31:11.082
I liked it very much!

31:11.246 --> 31:12.906
I just made it up!

31:15.918 --> 31:16.788
Give me a break!

31:17.628 --> 31:19.958
After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...

31:20.130 --> 31:21.970
-you wanna be my dad?
-I hear you.

31:22.132 --> 31:24.132
And by the way, this could be a trap.

31:24.301 --> 31:25.841
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

31:26.011 --> 31:27.681
-they all want us dead.
-I know, but...

31:27.846 --> 31:28.806
But what?

31:28.972 --> 31:31.432
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

31:31.600 --> 31:32.520
Who?

31:32.684 --> 31:33.984
He owned a magic boat?

31:35.938 --> 31:37.148
David Hasselhoff?

31:37.314 --> 31:38.194
Right.

31:38.357 --> 31:40.437
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

31:40.609 --> 31:41.649
Why did he talk again?

31:41.818 --> 31:45.278
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.987
As a child, you would carry his picture
in your pocket...

31:48.158 --> 31:49.868
and you would tell
all the other children...

31:50.035 --> 31:52.155
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

31:52.329 --> 31:54.869
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.380
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

31:57.543 --> 31:58.543
I love that story.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.670
I hate that story.

32:00.838 --> 32:02.378
It's so sad!

32:03.173 --> 32:07.553
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.389
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

32:11.139 --> 32:12.849
That's my point, Peter.

32:13.684 --> 32:16.564
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

32:19.982 --> 32:21.522
If he ends up being evil...

32:22.901 --> 32:24.531
we will just kill him.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.084
You're leaving me with that fox?

32:34.246 --> 32:35.406
He's not a fox.

32:35.581 --> 32:37.581
Shoot her
if she does anything suspicious.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.037
-Or if you feel like it.
-Okay.

32:42.212 --> 32:44.592
It'll be just a couple of days.

32:44.756 --> 32:47.546
We'll be back before Rocket's finished
fixing the ship.

32:50.846 --> 32:52.676
What if the Sovereign come?

32:52.848 --> 32:54.888
There's no way for them to know
we're here. Let's go.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.688
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

32:56.852 --> 32:58.402
God, you're like an old woman.

32:58.562 --> 33:00.272
Because I'm wise?

33:01.231 --> 33:03.191
Why do you have so much luggage?

33:03.358 --> 33:05.528
I don't want Groot playing
with my things.

33:08.572 --> 33:11.242
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

33:13.243 --> 33:17.083
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

33:17.873 --> 33:19.923
Because it's working.

33:23.295 --> 33:28.595
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again

33:29.593 --> 33:34.763
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

33:34.932 --> 33:37.932
And if you don't love me now

33:38.101 --> 33:41.231
You will never love me again

33:41.396 --> 33:45.276
I can still hear you saying

33:45.442 --> 33:47.492
You would never break the chain

33:47.653 --> 33:50.783
And if you don't love me now

33:50.948 --> 33:53.658
You will never love me again

33:53.825 --> 33:56.785
I can still hear you saying

33:56.954 --> 34:00.504
You would never break the chain

34:07.339 --> 34:09.299
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

34:11.176 --> 34:13.636
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.511
Your antennae, what are they for?

34:16.181 --> 34:17.141
Their purpose?

34:17.307 --> 34:19.137
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

34:19.309 --> 34:21.519
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

34:22.479 --> 34:23.559
I say...

34:23.730 --> 34:26.070
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

34:26.233 --> 34:28.993
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.322
Right. And if it's anything
other than...

34:31.488 --> 34:34.908
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

34:35.075 --> 34:37.575
They are not for feeling doorways.

34:39.496 --> 34:40.536
I think...

34:40.706 --> 34:43.496
they have something
to do with my empathic abilities.

34:44.084 --> 34:45.004
What are those?

34:45.169 --> 34:48.669
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

34:49.756 --> 34:51.416
-You read minds?
-No.

34:51.592 --> 34:53.892
Telepaths know thoughts.

34:54.052 --> 34:56.552
Empaths feel feelings.

34:57.848 --> 34:58.848
Emotions.

35:01.351 --> 35:02.521
May I?

35:03.562 --> 35:05.112
All right.

35:13.363 --> 35:15.873
You feel love.

35:17.451 --> 35:20.411
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

35:20.579 --> 35:21.709
No!

35:21.872 --> 35:23.872
Romantic, sexual love.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.381
No, I don't.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.212
-For her!
-No!

35:30.547 --> 35:31.757
Okay.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.888
She just told everyone your deepest,
darkest secret!

35:37.054 --> 35:39.394
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

35:39.556 --> 35:40.926
You must be so embarrassed!

35:44.770 --> 35:46.650
Do me! Do me!

35:51.902 --> 35:54.902
I have never felt such humor!

35:58.408 --> 36:00.448
So unbelievably uncool.

36:01.787 --> 36:02.997
Quill.

36:05.582 --> 36:09.592
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

36:14.925 --> 36:18.645
I can also alter emotions
to some extent.

36:18.804 --> 36:19.764
Yeah, like what?

36:20.597 --> 36:23.677
If I touch someone who is sad...

36:23.851 --> 36:26.601
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

36:26.770 --> 36:30.610
I can make a stubborn
person compliant.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.784
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

36:33.944 --> 36:37.784
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.202
Do one of those on me.

36:45.706 --> 36:47.456
Sleep.

37:40.219 --> 37:41.759
I love this song.

38:13.544 --> 38:14.884
There!

39:35.167 --> 39:37.707
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys...

39:37.878 --> 39:38.878
are you?

39:42.049 --> 39:43.129
Move!

39:59.900 --> 40:01.070
Crap.

40:06.615 --> 40:07.995
Hey there, rat!

40:08.158 --> 40:10.618
How's it going, you blue idiot?

40:10.994 --> 40:13.084
Not so bad.

40:13.247 --> 40:15.617
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

40:15.791 --> 40:18.591
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

40:18.752 --> 40:22.672
has offered us a large sum to deliver
you and your pals over to her...

40:22.840 --> 40:25.470
because she wants to kill y'all.

40:25.634 --> 40:26.844
Your friend...

40:27.010 --> 40:28.640
There's too many of them.

40:28.804 --> 40:32.024
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

40:32.182 --> 40:34.932
you need to get me out of these bonds.

40:35.477 --> 40:37.347
They are going to kill him!

40:37.521 --> 40:39.691
I tell you, it was pretty easy
to find you.

40:39.857 --> 40:41.817
I put a tracer
on your ship back there...

40:41.984 --> 40:43.364
during the war over Xandar.

40:43.861 --> 40:46.201
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

40:46.363 --> 40:48.373
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

40:49.116 --> 40:51.526
Lucky for you, my word
don't mean squat.

40:51.994 --> 40:54.294
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

40:54.454 --> 40:55.794
Otherwise, you'd what?

40:56.957 --> 40:58.327
We'll take them batteries.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.050
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

41:02.212 --> 41:04.552
That Priestess offered us a million.

41:04.715 --> 41:07.385
A quarter is only one third of that!

41:07.551 --> 41:08.721
A quarter ain't a third.

41:08.886 --> 41:10.716
A quarter is 25.

41:10.888 --> 41:11.808
No.

41:11.972 --> 41:14.392
We can't even buy a pair of boots
with 25 units.

41:14.558 --> 41:15.388
Enough!

41:15.559 --> 41:20.519
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

41:20.898 --> 41:23.398
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

41:23.567 --> 41:25.487
That ain't right!

41:26.236 --> 41:29.316
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.739
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

41:31.909 --> 41:34.739
you protect him
like none of the rest of us much matter!

41:34.912 --> 41:35.912
Yeah!

41:36.079 --> 41:37.579
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

41:37.748 --> 41:38.748
Take it easy, Kraglin.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.416
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

41:41.585 --> 41:44.715
Suppose it's time for a change
in leadership.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.968
Put your damn guns down!

41:52.137 --> 41:53.387
Whoa! Whoa!

41:53.555 --> 41:57.015
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

41:57.184 --> 42:00.064
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.792
Well, hello, boys.

42:26.463 --> 42:28.173
It's not ripe.

43:12.759 --> 43:16.219
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

43:16.388 --> 43:18.808
Wow. You have your own planet?

43:18.974 --> 43:22.774
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

43:22.978 --> 43:24.478
Humility.

43:24.646 --> 43:26.016
I like it.

43:26.398 --> 43:28.858
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

44:11.235 --> 44:15.325
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

44:15.989 --> 44:17.779
What are you exactly?

44:18.951 --> 44:22.291
I'm what's called
a Celestial, sweetheart.

44:23.539 --> 44:26.119
A Celestial, like a god?

44:27.793 --> 44:29.713
Small "g," son.

44:29.878 --> 44:32.708
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

44:44.351 --> 44:45.191
Whoa!

44:47.187 --> 44:50.517
I don't know where I came from exactly.

44:50.691 --> 44:52.691
First thing I remember is flickering...

44:53.277 --> 44:55.147
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

44:56.113 --> 44:58.663
and entirely alone.

44:59.741 --> 45:01.621
Over millions of years...

45:01.785 --> 45:05.325
I learned to control the molecules
around me.

45:05.664 --> 45:08.834
I grew smarter and stronger.

45:10.794 --> 45:13.764
And I continued building from there...

45:13.922 --> 45:16.012
layer by layer...

45:16.175 --> 45:18.805
the very planet you walk on now.

45:18.969 --> 45:20.259
Whoa.

45:20.888 --> 45:22.098
But I wanted more.

45:23.223 --> 45:24.893
I desired...

45:25.434 --> 45:26.564
meaning.

45:27.728 --> 45:31.688
"There must be some life out there
in the universe...

45:31.857 --> 45:34.647
"besides just me," I thought.

45:34.818 --> 45:38.818
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.

45:39.156 --> 45:40.616
I created...

45:40.782 --> 45:44.412
what I imagined biological life
to be like...

45:44.578 --> 45:48.328
down to the most minute detail.

45:49.458 --> 45:50.748
Did you make a penis?

45:50.918 --> 45:52.168
Dude!

45:52.336 --> 45:53.496
What is wrong with you?

45:53.670 --> 45:56.760
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

45:56.924 --> 45:57.924
He would smush her!

46:00.135 --> 46:02.295
I don't need to hear how my parents...

46:03.514 --> 46:04.514
Why?

46:05.307 --> 46:07.557
My father would tell the
story of impregnating

46:07.643 --> 46:09.023
my mother every winter solstice.

46:09.061 --> 46:10.481
That's disgusting.

46:10.646 --> 46:12.106
It was beautiful.

46:13.357 --> 46:14.897
You Earthers have hang-ups.

46:15.442 --> 46:17.572
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

46:18.403 --> 46:19.403
Thank you!

46:19.571 --> 46:20.741
It's not half bad.

46:22.533 --> 46:26.083
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

46:26.245 --> 46:28.045
and all the accompanying junk.

46:28.497 --> 46:33.127
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

46:33.293 --> 46:36.303
as I set out amongst the stars...

46:36.964 --> 46:39.134
until I found...

46:39.299 --> 46:41.009
what I sought.

46:42.553 --> 46:43.723
Life.

46:45.472 --> 46:47.892
I was not alone in the universe
after all.

46:54.606 --> 46:56.436
When did you meet my mother?

47:00.612 --> 47:02.362
Not long after.

47:08.036 --> 47:12.706
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

47:16.587 --> 47:19.757
I called her my river lily.

47:24.052 --> 47:26.642
And from that love, Peter...

47:30.184 --> 47:31.394
you.

47:38.692 --> 47:42.202
I have searched for you for so long.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.490
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

47:45.657 --> 47:49.407
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

47:51.163 --> 47:54.213
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

47:55.709 --> 47:58.129
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

48:19.191 --> 48:21.071
This is mutiny!

48:21.860 --> 48:24.150
This is mutiny!

48:24.321 --> 48:26.911
This is mutiny!

48:38.669 --> 48:40.089
You're scum!

49:15.831 --> 49:16.711
Captain!

49:16.874 --> 49:19.384
Help me! Please!

49:19.543 --> 49:21.133
Captain!

49:24.381 --> 49:26.131
You're the one what killed those men...

49:26.675 --> 49:28.505
by leading them down the wrong path.

49:29.386 --> 49:31.096
Because you're weak.

49:33.473 --> 49:35.063
And stupid!

49:37.102 --> 49:39.062
It's time for the Ravagers...

49:39.229 --> 49:43.069
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

49:43.859 --> 49:45.529
Taserface!

49:53.202 --> 49:56.832
I'm sorry. Your name is...

49:56.997 --> 49:58.707
It's Taserface?

49:59.124 --> 50:00.424
That's right.

50:00.792 --> 50:03.172
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

50:03.795 --> 50:05.665
It's metaphorical!

50:05.839 --> 50:06.669
Yeah!

50:10.344 --> 50:11.264
For what?

50:13.639 --> 50:16.219
For it is a name what strikes fear...

50:16.391 --> 50:19.191
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

50:21.855 --> 50:23.105
Okay.

50:23.690 --> 50:24.900
Okay...

50:25.067 --> 50:26.317
whatever you say.

50:26.818 --> 50:28.068
You shut up.

50:28.237 --> 50:29.527
You're next.

50:29.821 --> 50:33.911
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

50:34.076 --> 50:34.906
What?

50:36.203 --> 50:39.123
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

50:39.289 --> 50:42.289
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

50:42.459 --> 50:45.459
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

50:45.629 --> 50:49.339
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

50:51.635 --> 50:54.355
That's how I hear you in my head!

50:55.138 --> 50:57.308
What was your second choice?

50:57.474 --> 50:58.524
Scrotum Hat?

51:01.645 --> 51:04.235
New plan. We're killing you first.

51:05.649 --> 51:08.739
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

51:08.902 --> 51:12.822
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

51:12.990 --> 51:15.910
That's enough killing for today.

51:19.872 --> 51:21.502
She's the daughter of Thanos.

51:23.917 --> 51:25.917
I thought you were the biggest sadist
in the galaxy.

51:26.086 --> 51:28.916
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

51:29.089 --> 51:32.679
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

51:32.843 --> 51:35.853
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

51:37.514 --> 51:38.894
I assure you...

51:39.057 --> 51:41.847
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

51:42.019 --> 51:43.899
or a talking woodland beast.

51:45.272 --> 51:47.192
I want 10% of the take...

51:48.859 --> 51:50.569
and a couple more things.

51:52.404 --> 51:54.034
We got a whole box of hands...

51:54.198 --> 51:56.028
-if that one don't work out.
-It is fine.

51:56.200 --> 51:59.410
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

51:59.578 --> 52:03.788
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

52:03.957 --> 52:07.377
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

52:07.544 --> 52:09.214
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

52:09.379 --> 52:11.719
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

52:11.882 --> 52:14.052
What are you gonna
do with your share?

52:14.927 --> 52:15.797
As a child, my father would have

52:15.886 --> 52:19.136
Gamora and me battle
one another in training.

52:19.932 --> 52:22.232
Every time my sister prevailed...

52:22.392 --> 52:25.732
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

52:25.896 --> 52:28.566
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

52:29.650 --> 52:31.480
But she won...

52:31.652 --> 52:36.492
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

52:38.075 --> 52:40.455
So after I murder my sister...

52:40.619 --> 52:43.829
I will buy a warship with
every conceivable instrument of death.

52:43.997 --> 52:47.627
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

52:47.793 --> 52:49.253
piece by piece...

52:49.419 --> 52:52.799
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

52:52.965 --> 52:56.135
I know every single day.

52:57.928 --> 52:59.258
Yeah.

52:59.763 --> 53:01.603
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

53:02.349 --> 53:04.269
Or a nice hat.

53:04.434 --> 53:07.274
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

53:11.108 --> 53:14.278
Anyways, happy trails.

53:22.119 --> 53:25.659
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

53:27.332 --> 53:29.832
She had brain cancer, so
everyone  thought she was delusional.

53:30.002 --> 53:31.002
Peter...

53:31.170 --> 53:32.960
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

53:33.130 --> 53:34.460
But you left...

53:34.631 --> 53:37.511
the most wonderful woman ever...

53:37.676 --> 53:39.136
to die alone.

53:39.303 --> 53:42.723
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

53:42.890 --> 53:45.060
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

53:45.225 --> 53:46.635
and the light within it...

53:46.810 --> 53:48.310
this form will wither and perish.

53:48.478 --> 53:50.518
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

53:50.689 --> 53:52.649
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

53:53.025 --> 53:54.905
I loved your mother, Peter!

53:55.068 --> 53:57.488
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

53:57.654 --> 54:00.494
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

54:00.657 --> 54:03.077
I know exactly what that feels like!

54:03.243 --> 54:04.993
I had to watch her die!

54:09.374 --> 54:13.504
Over the millions and millions of years
of my existence...

54:13.670 --> 54:16.170
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

54:17.007 --> 54:19.217
But you're not one of them.

54:21.011 --> 54:24.761
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

54:30.020 --> 54:34.770
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

54:34.942 --> 54:36.692
and the light within.

54:37.027 --> 54:40.197
They are a part of you, Peter.

54:41.073 --> 54:42.743
What do you mean?

54:43.534 --> 54:45.454
Give me your hands, son.

54:46.411 --> 54:47.541
Here.

54:48.413 --> 54:50.293
Hold them like that.

54:56.213 --> 54:59.053
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

55:00.217 --> 55:03.257
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.

55:08.141 --> 55:08.981
Yes!

55:09.142 --> 55:10.062
Yes!

55:10.394 --> 55:12.064
Whoa!

55:12.229 --> 55:13.649
Yes! It's okay.

55:13.814 --> 55:14.904
Just relax. Concentrate.

55:15.065 --> 55:17.225
You can do it. Bring it back.

55:17.734 --> 55:18.824
Yes!

55:20.445 --> 55:23.235
Yes, now shape it.

55:23.574 --> 55:25.284
Feel that energy.

55:29.454 --> 55:30.464
Yes.

55:34.751 --> 55:36.131
You're home.

55:38.630 --> 55:39.760
Peter...

56:14.291 --> 56:17.211
How did you get to this weird,
dumb planet?

56:17.794 --> 56:20.674
Ego found me in my larva state.

56:20.839 --> 56:22.339
Orphaned on my homeworld.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.970
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

56:27.387 --> 56:28.807
So you're a pet?

56:29.973 --> 56:31.313
I suppose.

56:32.809 --> 56:35.189
People usually want cute pets.

56:35.354 --> 56:37.654
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

56:37.814 --> 56:39.074
I am hideous?

56:39.233 --> 56:41.483
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

56:44.571 --> 56:45.741
But that's a good thing.

56:47.241 --> 56:48.831
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

56:48.992 --> 56:51.492
you know they love you
for who you are.

56:52.829 --> 56:55.249
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

56:56.166 --> 56:59.086
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.

57:00.546 --> 57:03.666
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

57:03.841 --> 57:07.431
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

57:08.595 --> 57:09.925
She was like you.

57:10.347 --> 57:11.847
Disgusting?

57:12.850 --> 57:14.020
Innocent.

57:47.301 --> 57:48.301
Drax?

57:49.928 --> 57:51.598
There's something I must tell you.

58:00.063 --> 58:01.063
What's going on?

58:01.231 --> 58:03.151
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

58:03.317 --> 58:06.777
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

58:07.112 --> 58:08.742
You're not ugly. Drax!

58:08.906 --> 58:10.116
What are you talking about?

58:10.282 --> 58:11.452
Mantis...

58:11.909 --> 58:14.079
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

58:14.578 --> 58:16.328
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

58:16.496 --> 58:18.576
The planet is Ego.

58:18.749 --> 58:20.999
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

58:21.752 --> 58:23.002
And you're not a flea?

58:23.170 --> 58:25.460
I'm a flea with a purpose.

58:26.089 --> 58:27.759
I help him sleep.

58:28.926 --> 58:32.096
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

58:37.100 --> 58:38.270
Nothing.

58:39.102 --> 58:41.022
Your quarters are this way.

58:48.612 --> 58:52.162
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

58:54.451 --> 58:57.621
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

58:58.247 --> 59:00.287
Okay, Taserface.

59:00.958 --> 59:02.998
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

59:03.168 --> 59:04.628
"Hi," Taserface!

59:09.800 --> 59:12.300
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

59:12.469 --> 59:13.969
No, Gef.

59:14.137 --> 59:15.847
It's too adorable to kill.

59:16.014 --> 59:17.934
Take it to the tailor.

59:19.434 --> 59:22.814
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

59:25.148 --> 59:29.938
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

59:32.489 --> 59:35.159
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

59:35.325 --> 59:39.745
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

59:39.913 --> 59:41.663
But I was young...

59:42.666 --> 59:46.126
and greedy, and stupid.

59:47.087 --> 59:49.167
Like you stealing those batteries.

59:49.339 --> 59:50.919
That was mostly Drax.

59:52.342 --> 59:55.852
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

59:56.847 --> 59:59.177
we weren't so different from you
and your friends.

1:00:00.142 --> 1:00:02.022
The only family I ever had.

1:00:03.437 --> 1:00:05.147
When I broke the code...

1:00:07.357 --> 1:00:09.027
they exiled me.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.860
This is what I deserve.

1:00:12.029 --> 1:00:13.699
Slow down, drama queen.

1:00:13.864 --> 1:00:15.534
You might deserve this,
but I don't.

1:00:15.699 --> 1:00:17.489
We gotta get outta here.

1:00:18.952 --> 1:00:20.162
Where's Quill?

1:00:20.329 --> 1:00:21.869
He went off with his old man.

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:25.170
-Ego?
-Yeah.

1:00:25.334 --> 1:00:27.424
It's a day for dumbass names.

1:00:30.464 --> 1:00:32.884
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

1:00:33.050 --> 1:00:35.720
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

1:00:35.886 --> 1:00:38.256
You like a professional
asshole or what?

1:00:38.430 --> 1:00:39.390
Pretty much a pro.

1:00:39.556 --> 1:00:42.386
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

1:00:42.935 --> 1:00:44.645
He was skinny.

1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:49.230
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

1:00:54.154 --> 1:00:57.374
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

1:00:58.242 --> 1:01:00.742
But we're gonna need your little friend.

1:01:01.912 --> 1:01:04.372
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

1:01:15.425 --> 1:01:17.715
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

1:01:23.809 --> 1:01:26.519
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

1:01:26.687 --> 1:01:28.557
He's goddang precious!

1:01:42.619 --> 1:01:44.329
Hey, twig!

1:01:44.663 --> 1:01:46.123
Come here.

1:01:46.540 --> 1:01:47.750
Come on.

1:01:54.339 --> 1:01:55.259
Aw, man...

1:01:55.424 --> 1:01:57.014
what did they do to you?

1:02:00.095 --> 1:02:02.555
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

1:02:03.348 --> 1:02:06.518
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

1:02:06.685 --> 1:02:10.805
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

1:02:10.981 --> 1:02:12.611
the thing I wore on my head.

1:02:13.275 --> 1:02:17.365
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

1:02:17.529 --> 1:02:18.819
You got it?

1:02:52.481 --> 1:02:54.021
That's my underwears.

1:02:54.191 --> 1:02:56.191
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:58.490
You have to explain it more careful.

1:02:59.988 --> 1:03:03.408
It's a prototype fin.

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:11.622
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

1:03:11.792 --> 1:03:13.462
You explain it this time.

1:03:14.628 --> 1:03:16.168
All right.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.760
That's Vorker's eye.

1:03:18.924 --> 1:03:20.934
He takes it out when he sleeps.

1:03:21.093 --> 1:03:22.433
Go. Look again.

1:03:22.594 --> 1:03:24.014
But leave the eye here.

1:03:24.638 --> 1:03:25.468
Why?

1:03:25.639 --> 1:03:27.019
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

1:03:27.182 --> 1:03:29.522
and he's not gonna know...

1:03:29.685 --> 1:03:31.525
where his eye is!

1:03:38.151 --> 1:03:39.741
That's a desk.

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:42.703
We told you it was this big.

1:03:48.579 --> 1:03:50.749
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

1:03:50.914 --> 1:03:53.634
with a bunch of severed human toes.

1:03:53.792 --> 1:03:57.502
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

1:04:00.674 --> 1:04:04.304
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

1:04:04.469 --> 1:04:05.849
Okay?

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:16.266
What? No!

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:17.650
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

1:04:17.816 --> 1:04:19.026
That's not what I said!

1:04:19.193 --> 1:04:21.323
-I am Groot.
-He's relieved you don't want him to.

1:04:21.486 --> 1:04:22.946
-I am Groot.
-He hates hats.

1:04:23.113 --> 1:04:23.913
I am Groot.

1:04:24.072 --> 1:04:25.162
On anyone, not just himself.

1:04:25.324 --> 1:04:26.164
I am Groot.

1:04:26.325 --> 1:04:28.165
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

1:04:28.327 --> 1:04:30.747
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

1:04:31.205 --> 1:04:32.585
That's why you don't like hats?

1:04:33.665 --> 1:04:36.035
This is an important conversation
right now?

1:05:12.788 --> 1:05:13.788
That ain't it.

1:05:23.590 --> 1:05:25.130
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

1:05:28.095 --> 1:05:29.935
They killed all my friends.

1:05:33.976 --> 1:05:36.556
Get the third quadrant ready
for release.

1:05:43.277 --> 1:05:44.107
One more thing.

1:05:46.029 --> 1:05:48.449
You got any clones of Quill's old music
on the ship?

1:06:39.249 --> 1:06:40.249
He's got it!

1:06:40.417 --> 1:06:41.917
Yondu's got the fin!

1:06:42.085 --> 1:06:42.995
Go!

1:07:24.586 --> 1:07:25.416
Down there!

1:09:24.164 --> 1:09:25.624
You maniac.

1:09:27.543 --> 1:09:29.843
The whole ship's gonna blow.

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:41.260
Not the whole ship.

1:09:58.323 --> 1:09:59.373
Who is this?

1:09:59.533 --> 1:10:03.833
I am sending you the coordinates
for Yondu's ship.

1:10:04.288 --> 1:10:06.078
-Release the quadrant!
-Aye, Captain!

1:10:06.248 --> 1:10:08.748
I only ask one thing.

1:10:09.251 --> 1:10:10.881
That your High Priestess...

1:10:11.044 --> 1:10:14.634
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

1:10:15.591 --> 1:10:17.631
Taserface!

1:10:41.074 --> 1:10:42.334
Where to, Captain?

1:10:42.492 --> 1:10:43.492
Ego.

1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:46.330
No, boy!

1:10:54.046 --> 1:10:58.586
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

1:10:58.759 --> 1:10:59.719
I know that.

1:10:59.885 --> 1:11:02.395
We are about to do 700!

1:11:16.109 --> 1:11:18.359
So I guess this could all
be mine someday.

1:11:19.613 --> 1:11:22.243
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

1:11:29.373 --> 1:11:31.083
What are you doing, Peter?

1:11:33.377 --> 1:11:34.747
Dance with me.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.380
I'm not going to dance with you.

1:11:36.547 --> 1:11:38.297
This is Sam Cooke...

1:11:38.841 --> 1:11:42.011
one of the greatest Earth singers
of all time.

1:12:11.164 --> 1:12:13.174
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

1:12:14.293 --> 1:12:16.843
If you ever tell anyone about this...

1:12:17.004 --> 1:12:18.424
I will kill you.

1:12:19.173 --> 1:12:23.053
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

1:12:23.677 --> 1:12:25.097
What unspoken thing?

1:12:26.555 --> 1:12:28.225
This...

1:12:28.390 --> 1:12:31.180
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

1:12:31.351 --> 1:12:33.941
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

1:12:34.104 --> 1:12:36.654
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...

1:12:36.815 --> 1:12:37.855
sort of thing.

1:12:38.025 --> 1:12:39.485
There's no unspoken thing.

1:12:41.403 --> 1:12:44.703
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you
said it, then it would be spoken...

1:12:44.865 --> 1:12:47.625
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

1:12:47.784 --> 1:12:51.914
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:54.000
No, that's not what I...

1:12:56.335 --> 1:13:00.385
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

1:13:00.547 --> 1:13:02.337
It doesn't feel right.

1:13:02.799 --> 1:13:04.969
What are you talking about?

1:13:05.135 --> 1:13:06.385
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

1:13:06.553 --> 1:13:07.803
That girl Mantis...

1:13:07.971 --> 1:13:09.141
she's afraid of something.

1:13:09.473 --> 1:13:11.643
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?

1:13:11.808 --> 1:13:12.888
I'm not trying...

1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:14.980
He's my father. He's blood.

1:13:15.145 --> 1:13:16.645
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

1:13:16.813 --> 1:13:19.073
Again, you made me come here!

1:13:19.233 --> 1:13:21.153
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

1:13:21.318 --> 1:13:24.028
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

1:13:24.196 --> 1:13:26.866
This is real! I'm only half human,
remember?

1:13:27.032 --> 1:13:28.492
That's the half I'm worried about.

1:13:29.034 --> 1:13:30.704
I get it. You're jealous...

1:13:30.869 --> 1:13:33.199
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

1:13:33.372 --> 1:13:36.002
You were insufferable to begin with.

1:13:36.166 --> 1:13:37.206
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

1:13:37.376 --> 1:13:38.836
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

1:13:39.002 --> 1:13:41.842
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

1:13:42.005 --> 1:13:44.835
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing...

1:13:45.008 --> 1:13:46.588
to open themselves up
to new possibility,

1:13:46.677 --> 1:13:48.507
and the other person is a jerk...

1:13:48.595 --> 1:13:52.265
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.

1:13:52.432 --> 1:13:53.932
That's why it would get zero ratings!

1:13:54.351 --> 1:13:56.351
I don't know what Cheers is!

1:13:56.687 --> 1:13:59.727
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

1:14:00.899 --> 1:14:02.529
I thought you already had.

1:14:32.055 --> 1:14:33.255
Damn it.

1:15:06.423 --> 1:15:07.513
Psychopath!

1:17:17.888 --> 1:17:19.718
Are you kidding me?

1:17:46.124 --> 1:17:46.964
I win.

1:17:47.584 --> 1:17:49.794
I win. I bested you in combat.

1:17:49.962 --> 1:17:51.882
No. I saved your life.

1:17:52.047 --> 1:17:53.877
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

1:17:54.049 --> 1:17:55.049
You let me live!

1:17:55.217 --> 1:17:56.967
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

1:17:57.135 --> 1:17:58.215
I'm not the one that just flew across

1:17:58.262 --> 1:17:59.892
the universe just
because I wanted to win.

1:17:59.930 --> 1:18:01.470
Do not tell me what I want.

1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:03.060
I don't need to tell you
what you want!

1:18:03.225 --> 1:18:04.235
It's obvious!

1:18:04.393 --> 1:18:07.483
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

1:18:15.237 --> 1:18:16.777
You were all I had.

1:18:18.115 --> 1:18:20.955
But you were the one
who needed to win.

1:18:22.119 --> 1:18:24.329
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

1:18:25.122 --> 1:18:27.122
and my brain from my skull...

1:18:28.292 --> 1:18:30.172
and my arm from my body...

1:18:31.962 --> 1:18:34.092
because of you.

1:18:54.943 --> 1:18:55.993
You all right, son?

1:18:59.323 --> 1:19:01.993
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

1:19:02.618 --> 1:19:03.948
Yeah.

1:19:04.119 --> 1:19:05.829
It's fortuitous...

1:19:05.996 --> 1:19:07.246
you listening to this song.

1:19:07.414 --> 1:19:09.044
-You know...
-Brandy?

1:19:09.541 --> 1:19:10.631
By Looking Glass?

1:19:12.377 --> 1:19:13.747
A favorite of your mom's.

1:19:14.630 --> 1:19:16.170
Yeah, it was.

1:19:16.590 --> 1:19:18.260
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

1:19:18.425 --> 1:19:20.505
Perhaps its very greatest.

1:19:20.677 --> 1:19:21.677
Yes!

1:19:21.845 --> 1:19:25.015
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

1:19:27.226 --> 1:19:29.136
He came on a summer's day

1:19:29.478 --> 1:19:31.978
Bringing gifts from far away

1:19:34.024 --> 1:19:36.484
Like the child I put in your mother...

1:19:36.652 --> 1:19:38.702
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

1:19:40.781 --> 1:19:43.781
Brandy, you're a fine girl

1:19:43.951 --> 1:19:46.621
What a good wife you would be

1:19:47.704 --> 1:19:50.334
My life, my love

1:19:50.499 --> 1:19:53.789
My lady is the sea

1:19:53.961 --> 1:19:55.801
The sea calls the sailor back.

1:19:55.963 --> 1:19:58.553
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

1:19:59.299 --> 1:20:03.299
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

1:20:04.471 --> 1:20:08.021
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1:20:08.559 --> 1:20:10.689
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1:20:10.853 --> 1:20:11.983
No, Peter...

1:20:12.145 --> 1:20:14.145
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

1:20:14.565 --> 1:20:16.735
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

1:20:17.693 --> 1:20:18.783
I'm immortal?

1:20:21.029 --> 1:20:22.029
Really?

1:20:22.197 --> 1:20:25.027
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1:20:26.076 --> 1:20:29.326
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1:20:29.496 --> 1:20:31.786
like how you made this whole planet?

1:20:31.957 --> 1:20:34.327
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

1:20:34.501 --> 1:20:36.711
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

1:20:36.879 --> 1:20:37.919
What!

1:20:38.213 --> 1:20:41.683
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1:20:41.842 --> 1:20:42.882
and Heather Locklear.

1:20:43.051 --> 1:20:44.181
You can do anything you want.

1:20:44.344 --> 1:20:45.684
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1:20:45.846 --> 1:20:49.016
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1:20:49.183 --> 1:20:51.693
Only we can remake the universe.

1:20:51.852 --> 1:20:54.312
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1:20:54.479 --> 1:20:57.319
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1:20:58.483 --> 1:20:59.533
How?

1:21:09.995 --> 1:21:11.505
Come with me.

1:21:21.381 --> 1:21:23.011
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1:21:23.383 --> 1:21:25.053
Drax! We need to talk.

1:21:27.137 --> 1:21:28.967
I'm sorry.

1:21:29.139 --> 1:21:31.309
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

1:21:31.475 --> 1:21:32.565
What?

1:21:32.726 --> 1:21:35.976
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1:21:36.146 --> 1:21:37.606
No, that's not what I...

1:21:41.109 --> 1:21:42.529
What are you doing?

1:21:43.111 --> 1:21:45.491
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1:21:45.656 --> 1:21:46.946
Drax...

1:21:47.491 --> 1:21:48.661
I don't like you like that.

1:21:48.825 --> 1:21:50.785
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1:21:51.286 --> 1:21:53.746
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1:21:53.914 --> 1:21:56.464
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

1:21:56.625 --> 1:21:58.425
I should have told you earlier.

1:21:58.585 --> 1:22:01.705
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1:22:07.427 --> 1:22:08.427
What is that?

1:22:11.932 --> 1:22:15.482
Now, you need to readjust the way
you process life.

1:22:15.644 --> 1:22:18.734
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1:22:18.897 --> 1:22:22.357
Everything is temporary.

1:22:22.526 --> 1:22:25.446
We are forever.

1:22:25.612 --> 1:22:26.952
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1:22:27.114 --> 1:22:29.534
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:31.660
which is why you're here.

1:22:31.827 --> 1:22:33.947
I told you how all those years ago...

1:22:34.121 --> 1:22:38.251
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1:22:38.417 --> 1:22:42.457
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1:22:43.213 --> 1:22:44.513
it was all so...

1:22:46.967 --> 1:22:48.797
disappointing.

1:22:49.136 --> 1:22:52.636
And that is when I came...

1:22:52.806 --> 1:22:56.516
to a profound realization.

1:22:57.811 --> 1:23:01.941
My innate desire to seek out
other life...

1:23:02.482 --> 1:23:06.652
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1:23:08.947 --> 1:23:10.117
Peter...

1:23:11.074 --> 1:23:14.294
I have found meaning.

1:23:34.181 --> 1:23:35.521
I see it.

1:23:37.976 --> 1:23:39.806
Eternity!

1:23:40.145 --> 1:23:41.645
Oh, my God.

1:23:52.241 --> 1:23:54.331
We need to get off this planet.

1:24:08.006 --> 1:24:09.296
Oh, man.

1:24:09.466 --> 1:24:11.886
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1:24:12.052 --> 1:24:14.932
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1:24:25.858 --> 1:24:27.898
What the hell you doing, boy?

1:24:28.068 --> 1:24:30.148
I could tell
by how you talked about him...

1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:31.650
this Ego is bad news.

1:24:31.822 --> 1:24:33.452
We're here to save Quill.

1:24:33.615 --> 1:24:37.655
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1:24:37.870 --> 1:24:40.750
No. I don't care about those things.

1:24:40.914 --> 1:24:43.214
I wanna save Quill so I can prove
I'm better than him!

1:24:43.375 --> 1:24:46.205
I can lord this over him forever.

1:24:47.921 --> 1:24:49.801
What are you laughing at me for?

1:24:50.382 --> 1:24:55.102
You can fool yourself and everyone
else, but you can't fool me.

1:24:55.262 --> 1:24:56.472
I know who you are.

1:24:56.638 --> 1:24:58.928
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1:24:59.099 --> 1:25:01.349
I know everything about you.

1:25:01.852 --> 1:25:04.232
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

1:25:04.396 --> 1:25:05.856
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1:25:06.023 --> 1:25:06.863
Shut up!

1:25:07.024 --> 1:25:09.324
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1:25:09.484 --> 1:25:12.074
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1:25:12.237 --> 1:25:13.527
because just a little bit of love...

1:25:13.697 --> 1:25:17.027
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1:25:17.367 --> 1:25:18.617
I said shut up!

1:25:19.077 --> 1:25:22.157
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1:25:22.331 --> 1:25:23.621
I'm serious, dude!

1:25:23.790 --> 1:25:26.380
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1:25:26.543 --> 1:25:28.553
their own little baby,
into slavery.

1:25:29.046 --> 1:25:31.296
I know who you are, boy.

1:25:31.465 --> 1:25:33.475
Because you're me.

1:25:40.015 --> 1:25:42.095
What kind of a pair are we?

1:25:43.393 --> 1:25:46.443
The kind that's about to go fight
a planet, I reckon.

1:25:46.605 --> 1:25:49.775
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1:25:50.192 --> 1:25:51.612
Fight a what?

1:25:55.989 --> 1:25:56.949
Who are you people?

1:25:57.115 --> 1:25:58.065
What is this place?

1:25:58.242 --> 1:25:59.242
Gamora, let her go!

1:25:59.409 --> 1:26:01.579
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1:26:01.745 --> 1:26:04.035
You are scared.

1:26:07.459 --> 1:26:10.339
I call it the Expansion.

1:26:11.463 --> 1:26:14.763
It is my purpose...

1:26:14.925 --> 1:26:18.435
and now it is yours as well.

1:26:19.304 --> 1:26:20.894
It's beautiful.

1:26:22.015 --> 1:26:23.305
Over thousands of years...

1:26:23.475 --> 1:26:27.595
I implanted thousands of extensions
of myself...

1:26:27.771 --> 1:26:30.481
on thousands of worlds.

1:26:30.649 --> 1:26:34.439
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1:26:34.611 --> 1:26:36.491
To grow and spread...

1:26:36.655 --> 1:26:39.785
covering all that exists...

1:26:39.950 --> 1:26:44.120
until everything is...

1:26:45.414 --> 1:26:46.414
Me!

1:26:47.207 --> 1:26:49.457
What did she do to me?

1:26:49.626 --> 1:26:51.336
She already told me everything.

1:26:51.503 --> 1:26:53.963
I only had one problem.

1:26:54.673 --> 1:26:59.723
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1:26:59.887 --> 1:27:02.007
But two Celestials...

1:27:02.181 --> 1:27:05.481
Well, now, that just might do.

1:27:08.228 --> 1:27:09.598
The bodies...

1:27:10.355 --> 1:27:12.765
are his children.

1:27:13.192 --> 1:27:14.482
Out of all my labors...

1:27:14.651 --> 1:27:16.781
the most beguiling was...

1:27:16.945 --> 1:27:20.365
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1:27:20.532 --> 1:27:23.452
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

1:27:23.619 --> 1:27:25.539
to power the Expansion.

1:27:26.538 --> 1:27:29.038
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1:27:29.208 --> 1:27:32.708
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously...

1:27:32.878 --> 1:27:36.458
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1:27:36.632 --> 1:27:39.262
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1:27:39.426 --> 1:27:42.716
But one after the other, they failed me.

1:27:42.888 --> 1:27:46.728
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1:27:46.892 --> 1:27:48.142
Until you, Peter.

1:27:49.353 --> 1:27:51.943
Out of all my spawn...

1:27:52.105 --> 1:27:56.185
only you carried the connection
to the light.

1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:59.240
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1:27:59.404 --> 1:28:01.994
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:04.580
-Then we just go.
-No!

1:28:04.743 --> 1:28:07.003
-He's our friend.
-All any of you do...

1:28:07.162 --> 1:28:09.332
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1:28:09.498 --> 1:28:10.868
You're right.

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:12.536
We're family.

1:28:14.378 --> 1:28:15.998
We leave no one behind.

1:28:19.383 --> 1:28:20.763
Except maybe you.

1:28:21.260 --> 1:28:22.760
Oh, my God.

1:28:23.428 --> 1:28:25.508
For the first time in my existence...

1:28:25.681 --> 1:28:28.731
I am truly not alone!

1:28:34.147 --> 1:28:35.437
What is it, son?

1:28:38.694 --> 1:28:39.944
My friends.

1:28:41.196 --> 1:28:45.236
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1:28:45.784 --> 1:28:46.664
Yes.

1:28:46.827 --> 1:28:49.907
We are beyond such things.

1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:51.080
Yes.

1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:54.710
-Now...
-But my mother...

1:28:57.588 --> 1:28:59.918
You said you loved my mother.

1:29:00.090 --> 1:29:01.590
And that I did.

1:29:02.843 --> 1:29:07.723
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1:29:09.516 --> 1:29:12.186
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1:29:12.352 --> 1:29:14.902
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1:29:15.063 --> 1:29:16.613
I'd never leave.

1:29:17.733 --> 1:29:19.283
The Expansion...

1:29:20.694 --> 1:29:23.034
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

1:29:23.197 --> 1:29:25.237
So, I did what I had to do.

1:29:28.035 --> 1:29:31.545
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1:29:36.043 --> 1:29:36.883
What?

1:29:37.044 --> 1:29:38.594
Now, all right...

1:29:38.754 --> 1:29:40.514
I know that sounds bad.

1:29:52.434 --> 1:29:55.904
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1:29:56.063 --> 1:29:57.693
You killed my mother!

1:29:57.856 --> 1:29:58.896
I tried...

1:29:59.066 --> 1:30:00.816
so hard...

1:30:00.984 --> 1:30:02.364
to find the form...

1:30:02.528 --> 1:30:04.898
that best suited you...

1:30:05.072 --> 1:30:07.492
and this is the thanks I get?

1:30:09.201 --> 1:30:11.751
You really need to grow up.

1:30:15.832 --> 1:30:18.082
I wanted to do this together...

1:30:18.252 --> 1:30:21.052
but I suppose you'll have
to learn by spending

1:30:21.171 --> 1:30:23.631
the next thousand years as a battery!

1:30:25.342 --> 1:30:27.142
Finally! Rocket?

1:30:27.302 --> 1:30:30.012
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1:30:30.180 --> 1:30:33.350
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1:30:33.517 --> 1:30:34.807
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1:30:34.977 --> 1:30:35.847
Ego's unhinged.

1:30:36.019 --> 1:30:37.439
I know. Get ready.

1:30:37.604 --> 1:30:39.024
Drop her, Kraglin.

1:30:57.624 --> 1:30:58.754
No.

1:31:09.845 --> 1:31:12.725
My life, my love

1:31:12.890 --> 1:31:15.100
My lady is the sea

1:31:17.186 --> 1:31:18.306
Peter...

1:31:19.104 --> 1:31:21.444
this is the sea.

1:32:04.608 --> 1:32:06.278
Hey, there, jackass!

1:32:16.537 --> 1:32:18.037
What is that thing?

1:32:25.546 --> 1:32:27.506
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1:32:32.261 --> 1:32:34.931
I told you something didn't feel right.

1:32:35.097 --> 1:32:37.387
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

1:32:37.558 --> 1:32:39.228
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1:32:39.893 --> 1:32:41.193
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1:32:41.353 --> 1:32:43.403
There is no unspoken thing.

1:32:43.564 --> 1:32:45.234
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1:32:45.941 --> 1:32:47.481
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1:32:47.651 --> 1:32:48.821
We had it under control.

1:32:48.986 --> 1:32:51.316
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1:32:51.488 --> 1:32:53.618
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1:32:53.782 --> 1:32:55.032
What's Smurfette doing here?

1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:57.040
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

1:32:57.202 --> 1:32:58.452
She tried to murder me!

1:32:58.620 --> 1:33:00.460
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1:33:00.622 --> 1:33:02.042
He's not a fox.

1:33:02.207 --> 1:33:04.247
-I am Groot.
-I'm not a raboon, either.

1:33:04.418 --> 1:33:05.418
I am Groot.

1:33:05.586 --> 1:33:07.126
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1:33:10.549 --> 1:33:11.879
How do we kill a Celestial?

1:33:12.050 --> 1:33:13.470
There's a center to him.

1:33:13.635 --> 1:33:17.135
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.

1:33:17.472 --> 1:33:18.522
It's in the caverns...

1:33:18.682 --> 1:33:19.772
below the surface.

1:33:22.352 --> 1:33:23.652
Yondu?

1:33:32.571 --> 1:33:33.821
Thrusters are out.

1:33:34.323 --> 1:33:36.073
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1:33:36.241 --> 1:33:38.081
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me
to this maniac.

1:33:38.243 --> 1:33:40.663
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1:33:40.829 --> 1:33:42.289
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

1:33:42.956 --> 1:33:45.036
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

1:33:45.209 --> 1:33:46.789
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.500
You said you were gonna eat me.

1:33:48.670 --> 1:33:50.210
That was being funny!

1:33:51.006 --> 1:33:52.166
Not to me!

1:33:52.341 --> 1:33:53.511
You people have issues.

1:33:53.675 --> 1:33:55.545
Of course I have issues.

1:33:56.386 --> 1:33:59.216
That's my freakin' father!

1:33:59.389 --> 1:34:00.969
Thrusters are back up.

1:34:14.571 --> 1:34:16.741
-We should be going up!
-We can't!

1:34:16.907 --> 1:34:19.487
Ego wants to eradicate the universe
as we know it.

1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:20.950
We have to kill him.

1:34:21.119 --> 1:34:21.789
Rocket!

1:34:21.954 --> 1:34:22.704
Got it!

1:34:36.844 --> 1:34:38.684
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1:34:38.846 --> 1:34:39.926
I guess.

1:34:40.097 --> 1:34:41.177
Awesome!

1:34:43.183 --> 1:34:45.393
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1:34:45.561 --> 1:34:47.151
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1:34:47.312 --> 1:34:49.902
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1:34:50.065 --> 1:34:52.815
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1:34:52.985 --> 1:34:55.285
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1:34:55.445 --> 1:34:57.275
and all the animals on the planets.

1:34:57.447 --> 1:34:58.657
And the people.

1:34:58.824 --> 1:34:59.824
Meh.

1:35:00.450 --> 1:35:04.620
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1:35:42.326 --> 1:35:43.326
Pilots...

1:35:43.493 --> 1:35:44.833
release envoy units.

1:35:46.997 --> 1:35:51.077
Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.

1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:53.920
Dive!

1:36:10.896 --> 1:36:12.396
Captain?

1:36:13.148 --> 1:36:14.568
Captain?

1:36:19.530 --> 1:36:21.280
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:23.450
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1:36:23.617 --> 1:36:25.737
to help destroy the universe.

1:36:25.911 --> 1:36:28.161
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1:36:28.330 --> 1:36:29.460
So, could you?

1:36:29.623 --> 1:36:30.793
A little.

1:36:30.958 --> 1:36:32.128
I made a ball.

1:36:32.292 --> 1:36:33.342
A ball?

1:36:33.502 --> 1:36:36.882
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.

1:36:37.047 --> 1:36:38.297
You "thought"?

1:36:38.465 --> 1:36:40.505
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1:36:40.676 --> 1:36:42.086
I use my head?

1:36:54.064 --> 1:36:55.364
Whoa.

1:37:04.199 --> 1:37:05.199
There.

1:37:05.367 --> 1:37:07.327
That's Ego's core.

1:37:09.705 --> 1:37:11.335
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1:37:11.498 --> 1:37:13.118
I got it covered.

1:37:19.506 --> 1:37:20.836
We must hurry.

1:37:21.008 --> 1:37:23.128
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1:37:27.347 --> 1:37:28.557
Keep it steady.

1:37:35.063 --> 1:37:37.153
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1:37:43.530 --> 1:37:44.860
Captain?

1:37:45.199 --> 1:37:46.199
What is it, Kraglin?

1:37:46.366 --> 1:37:48.406
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1:37:48.869 --> 1:37:50.039
Yeah, why?

1:37:51.038 --> 1:37:52.078
Oh, hell!

1:38:12.851 --> 1:38:14.561
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1:38:14.937 --> 1:38:16.647
They blew out the generator.

1:38:16.813 --> 1:38:19.573
I think I packed a small detonator.

1:38:19.733 --> 1:38:21.323
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1:38:21.485 --> 1:38:23.075
Well, we got these.

1:38:23.737 --> 1:38:25.737
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1:38:25.906 --> 1:38:27.816
If it is,
it'll cause a chain reaction...

1:38:27.991 --> 1:38:29.661
throughout his entire nervous system.

1:38:29.826 --> 1:38:30.576
Meaning what?

1:38:30.744 --> 1:38:32.374
The entire planet will explode.

1:38:32.538 --> 1:38:34.038
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1:38:34.206 --> 1:38:35.706
I rigged a timer.

1:38:36.667 --> 1:38:37.877
Go!

1:38:51.974 --> 1:38:53.774
He's coming.

1:38:55.185 --> 1:38:56.975
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

1:38:57.354 --> 1:38:59.774
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:01.360
I can't!

1:39:01.775 --> 1:39:03.645
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1:39:04.361 --> 1:39:06.491
because I believe in you.

1:39:18.792 --> 1:39:19.462
Sleep!

1:39:27.176 --> 1:39:28.756
I never thought
she'd be able to do it...

1:39:28.927 --> 1:39:31.177
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1:39:32.097 --> 1:39:35.177
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1:39:38.312 --> 1:39:39.982
The metal's too thick.

1:39:40.147 --> 1:39:43.477
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1:39:43.650 --> 1:39:46.030
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1:39:46.737 --> 1:39:47.697
Well...

1:39:50.324 --> 1:39:52.204
That's a terrible idea.

1:39:52.367 --> 1:39:54.737
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.

1:39:55.704 --> 1:39:57.124
Unbelievable.

1:39:57.289 --> 1:39:59.619
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

1:40:01.126 --> 1:40:02.586
What a day.

1:40:10.177 --> 1:40:13.717
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1:40:13.889 --> 1:40:15.099
That activates it.

1:40:15.265 --> 1:40:17.095
Then you push this button...

1:40:17.267 --> 1:40:20.307
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

1:40:20.479 --> 1:40:21.859
Now, whatever you do...

1:40:22.397 --> 1:40:24.817
don't push this button...

1:40:24.983 --> 1:40:28.573
because that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1:40:28.737 --> 1:40:31.157
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1:40:31.323 --> 1:40:33.123
-I am Groot.
-Uh-huh.

1:40:33.283 --> 1:40:35.243
-I am Groot.
-That's right.

1:40:35.410 --> 1:40:36.620
-I am Groot.
-No!

1:40:36.954 --> 1:40:39.334
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1:40:39.498 --> 1:40:40.498
Try again.

1:40:43.502 --> 1:40:45.342
-I am Groot.
-Mm-hmm.

1:40:45.504 --> 1:40:47.554
-I am Groot.
-Uh-huh.

1:40:47.714 --> 1:40:48.634
I am Groot.

1:40:48.799 --> 1:40:50.629
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1:40:50.801 --> 1:40:52.391
How is that even possible?

1:40:52.553 --> 1:40:54.763
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1:40:54.930 --> 1:40:56.060
Point to it.

1:40:56.223 --> 1:40:57.183
No!

1:40:57.516 --> 1:40:59.266
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1:40:59.434 --> 1:41:01.194
Shut up and get me some tape!

1:41:01.353 --> 1:41:02.733
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1:41:02.896 --> 1:41:04.606
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1:41:04.773 --> 1:41:07.653
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1:41:07.818 --> 1:41:09.278
Yo, Yondu...

1:41:10.654 --> 1:41:12.824
Do you have any tape?

1:41:15.117 --> 1:41:18.157
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1:41:18.328 --> 1:41:19.368
Tape!

1:41:19.538 --> 1:41:20.788
Never mind.

1:41:22.875 --> 1:41:25.465
Drax, do you have any tape?

1:41:26.211 --> 1:41:28.171
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1:41:28.463 --> 1:41:30.423
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1:41:30.507 --> 1:41:32.007
if you don't have any?

1:41:33.010 --> 1:41:34.140
Nobody has any tape!

1:41:34.303 --> 1:41:35.853
Not a single person has tape?

1:41:36.221 --> 1:41:37.221
Nope!

1:41:37.389 --> 1:41:38.559
Did you ask Nebula?

1:41:39.433 --> 1:41:40.143
Yes!

1:41:40.309 --> 1:41:41.519
Are you sure?

1:41:41.685 --> 1:41:42.975
I asked Yondu...

1:41:43.145 --> 1:41:45.315
-and she was sitting next to him.
-I knew you were lying!

1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:47.520
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1:41:47.691 --> 1:41:50.071
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1:41:50.235 --> 1:41:53.735
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1:41:53.947 --> 1:41:56.447
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1:42:02.789 --> 1:42:04.789
We're all gonna die.

1:42:06.460 --> 1:42:08.630
Rear thrusters are out again!

1:42:08.795 --> 1:42:11.585
We're done for without that generator!

1:42:24.853 --> 1:42:26.103
Guardians...

1:42:26.897 --> 1:42:28.567
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1:42:28.732 --> 1:42:31.402
that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1:42:31.902 --> 1:42:33.572
They will serve as a warning...

1:42:33.737 --> 1:42:35.987
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

1:42:36.532 --> 1:42:39.332
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:44.160
This is gonna hurt.

1:42:44.331 --> 1:42:45.961
Promises, promises.

1:42:56.301 --> 1:42:57.141
Hey!

1:43:08.939 --> 1:43:09.939
No!

1:43:10.524 --> 1:43:12.654
No! No! No!

1:43:18.115 --> 1:43:19.125
We're gonna blow!

1:43:24.371 --> 1:43:26.411
Peter! No!

1:43:46.226 --> 1:43:47.136
What?

1:43:47.561 --> 1:43:49.561
You look like Mary Poppins.

1:43:49.730 --> 1:43:51.150
Is he cool?

1:43:52.941 --> 1:43:54.651
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1:43:55.319 --> 1:43:57.279
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1:44:24.598 --> 1:44:26.678
Mantis, look out!

1:44:38.737 --> 1:44:40.407
She's just unconscious.

1:44:56.380 --> 1:44:57.920
How long until the bomb goes off?

1:44:58.090 --> 1:45:00.430
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1:45:00.592 --> 1:45:01.842
about six minutes.

1:45:06.807 --> 1:45:09.307
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1:45:09.476 --> 1:45:10.476
T-minus five minutes.

1:45:10.644 --> 1:45:11.814
Aye, Captain.

1:45:15.649 --> 1:45:17.569
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1:45:18.861 --> 1:45:20.401
Drax, take Mantis.

1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:24.620
My nipples!

1:45:32.749 --> 1:45:34.079
Gamora!

1:45:37.713 --> 1:45:38.843
Peter!

1:46:05.073 --> 1:46:06.493
Get over it.

1:46:06.867 --> 1:46:10.747
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1:46:12.748 --> 1:46:17.248
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1:46:46.698 --> 1:46:47.818
Yeah!

1:46:48.784 --> 1:46:52.414
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:56.290
So stop pissing me off!

1:47:16.395 --> 1:47:18.025
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1:47:26.113 --> 1:47:27.113
Go!

1:49:26.567 --> 1:49:28.147
I told you...

1:49:28.318 --> 1:49:32.238
I don't want to do this alone.

1:49:35.450 --> 1:49:36.450
You cannot deny...

1:49:36.618 --> 1:49:40.958
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1:49:50.048 --> 1:49:51.838
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1:49:52.050 --> 1:49:53.050
What is that?

1:50:08.734 --> 1:50:11.034
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1:50:13.071 --> 1:50:16.201
Why are you destroying our chance?

1:50:18.827 --> 1:50:21.957
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1:50:23.874 --> 1:50:24.874
One in billions.

1:50:26.585 --> 1:50:28.425
Trillions. Even more.

1:50:30.756 --> 1:50:35.136
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

1:50:37.804 --> 1:50:41.984
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1:50:42.476 --> 1:50:44.346
I use my heart...

1:51:19.596 --> 1:51:23.386
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1:51:23.559 --> 1:51:27.099
And if you don't love me now

1:51:27.271 --> 1:51:29.691
You will never love me again

1:51:29.857 --> 1:51:32.687
I can still hear you saying

1:51:32.860 --> 1:51:36.780
You would never break the chain

1:51:36.947 --> 1:51:38.987
And if you don't love me now

1:51:39.157 --> 1:51:41.827
You will never love me again

1:51:42.452 --> 1:51:46.622
I can still hear you saying

1:51:46.790 --> 1:51:49.580
You would never break the chain

1:51:49.751 --> 1:51:52.301
And if you don't love me now

1:51:52.462 --> 1:51:55.342
You will never love me again

1:51:55.507 --> 1:52:00.967
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

1:52:03.640 --> 1:52:06.430
Groot? If you can hear me,
hurry up!

1:52:06.602 --> 1:52:09.852
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1:52:10.230 --> 1:52:11.820
Groot, hurry!

1:53:07.579 --> 1:53:09.829
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1:53:09.998 --> 1:53:11.458
Get to the ship!

1:53:11.625 --> 1:53:12.675
Not without Quill!

1:53:12.835 --> 1:53:15.005
You need to take care of the twig!

1:53:16.255 --> 1:53:18.055
Not without you!

1:53:19.216 --> 1:53:22.506
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1:53:25.889 --> 1:53:28.099
You need to give me this.

1:53:38.318 --> 1:53:40.818
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1:53:40.988 --> 1:53:43.158
I only have one of each.

1:53:55.419 --> 1:53:57.089
I am Groot.

1:53:57.838 --> 1:53:58.918
What's that?

1:54:00.549 --> 1:54:04.759
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1:54:05.345 --> 1:54:07.715
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1:54:13.979 --> 1:54:15.059
Bye, twig.

1:54:16.982 --> 1:54:20.612
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

1:55:15.249 --> 1:55:16.249
Where's Peter?

1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000
Rocket, where is he?

1:55:19.753 --> 1:55:20.713
Rocket.

1:55:20.879 --> 1:55:22.459
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1:55:28.846 --> 1:55:31.216
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1:55:38.188 --> 1:55:39.188
I'm sorry.

1:55:40.023 --> 1:55:42.863
I can only afford to lose one
friend today.

1:55:43.402 --> 1:55:44.402
Kraglin, go!

1:55:45.237 --> 1:55:46.237
Wait...

1:55:46.989 --> 1:55:48.569
Is Quill back?

1:55:50.075 --> 1:55:52.615
Rocket, where's Quill?

1:55:53.662 --> 1:55:57.082
Rocket, where's Quill?

1:55:58.083 --> 1:55:59.333
Rocket!

1:56:00.419 --> 1:56:01.249
Where's Quill?

1:56:03.422 --> 1:56:05.422
Where's Quill?

1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:15.890
No, we need to stop it.

1:56:21.064 --> 1:56:22.074
Stop.

1:56:22.858 --> 1:56:24.478
Stop. Listen to me!

1:56:24.651 --> 1:56:26.241
You are a god.

1:56:27.654 --> 1:56:28.994
If you kill me...

1:56:29.156 --> 1:56:31.776
you'll be just like everybody else.

1:56:32.826 --> 1:56:34.446
What's so wrong with that?

1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:35.620
No!

1:57:26.255 --> 1:57:30.015
He may have been your father, boy,
but he wasn't your daddy.

1:57:34.346 --> 1:57:36.676
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1:57:37.766 --> 1:57:40.056
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1:57:43.814 --> 1:57:45.154
What?

1:57:56.910 --> 1:57:58.080
Yondu, what are you doing?

1:57:58.245 --> 1:57:59.415
You can't.

1:58:00.122 --> 1:58:01.872
Yondu!

1:58:07.462 --> 1:58:09.052
No!

1:58:13.635 --> 1:58:14.505
No!

1:58:17.890 --> 1:58:20.480
No! No!

1:58:21.768 --> 1:58:23.058
No!

1:59:17.866 --> 1:59:19.276
I told Gamora...

1:59:19.451 --> 1:59:23.371
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1:59:26.124 --> 1:59:28.844
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1:59:30.337 --> 1:59:32.257
Earlier, it struck me...

1:59:33.465 --> 1:59:37.585
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1:59:38.178 --> 1:59:40.308
He didn't have the beautiful voice
of an angel...

1:59:40.472 --> 1:59:42.772
but he did have the whistle of one.

1:59:42.933 --> 1:59:46.443
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1:59:46.603 --> 1:59:49.113
and hooked up with hot women...

1:59:49.273 --> 1:59:51.273
and fought robots.

1:59:53.944 --> 1:59:57.954
I guess David Hasselhoff did
kind of end up being my dad after all.

1:59:58.115 --> 1:59:59.285
Only it was you, Yondu.

2:00:05.873 --> 2:00:07.793
I had a pretty cool dad.

2:00:10.794 --> 2:00:13.464
What I'm trying to say here is...

2:00:14.464 --> 2:00:19.144
sometimes that thing you're searching
for your whole life...

2:00:21.471 --> 2:00:23.811
it's right there by your side all along.

2:00:23.974 --> 2:00:25.814
You don't even know it.

2:00:37.863 --> 2:00:39.323
I am Groot.

2:00:40.699 --> 2:00:42.489
He did call you twig.

2:00:44.870 --> 2:00:46.200
Nebula...

2:00:51.168 --> 2:00:53.168
I was a child like you.

2:00:54.004 --> 2:00:58.174
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

2:00:58.342 --> 2:01:01.302
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

2:01:01.470 --> 2:01:03.220
I'm trying to make it right.

2:01:03.388 --> 2:01:04.808
There are little girls like you...

2:01:04.973 --> 2:01:07.813
across the universe who are in danger.

2:01:10.479 --> 2:01:12.019
You can stay with us and help them.

2:01:12.648 --> 2:01:15.028
I will help them by killing Thanos.

2:01:15.192 --> 2:01:17.192
I don't know if that's possible.

2:01:32.084 --> 2:01:34.214
You will always be my sister.

2:02:18.589 --> 2:02:19.419
Pete!

2:02:23.218 --> 2:02:24.968
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

2:02:25.137 --> 2:02:27.967
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

2:02:29.766 --> 2:02:30.926
What is it?

2:02:31.101 --> 2:02:32.061
It's called a Zune.

2:02:32.227 --> 2:02:33.937
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

2:02:34.104 --> 2:02:35.654
It's got 300 songs on it.

2:02:35.814 --> 2:02:38.114
300 songs?

2:02:43.238 --> 2:02:44.408
Wait.

2:02:50.454 --> 2:02:52.294
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

2:02:52.456 --> 2:02:54.916
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

2:02:58.337 --> 2:02:59.667
Thanks...

2:03:01.507 --> 2:03:02.797
Captain.

2:03:41.839 --> 2:03:44.629
It's not time to make a change

2:03:45.676 --> 2:03:49.296
Just relax, take it easy

2:03:49.471 --> 2:03:53.181
You're still young, that's your fault

2:03:53.350 --> 2:03:56.310
There's so much you have to know

2:03:56.478 --> 2:04:00.648
Find a girl, settle down

2:04:00.816 --> 2:04:03.936
If you want you can marry

2:04:04.111 --> 2:04:09.531
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

2:04:14.872 --> 2:04:16.212
They came.

2:04:24.214 --> 2:04:25.674
What is it?

2:04:26.341 --> 2:04:30.471
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager
buddies, and told them what he did.

2:04:34.057 --> 2:04:35.887
It's a Ravager funeral.

2:04:53.327 --> 2:04:54.237
Yeah!

2:04:54.912 --> 2:04:56.372
Yeah!

2:05:03.712 --> 2:05:05.592
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

2:05:06.548 --> 2:05:08.338
No, he did not, son.

2:05:09.343 --> 2:05:10.763
He did not.

2:05:17.434 --> 2:05:20.854
Fare thee well, old friend.

2:05:23.065 --> 2:05:27.905
Yondu Udonta, I will see you
in the stars.

2:05:31.949 --> 2:05:33.949
He didn't chase them away.

2:05:34.117 --> 2:05:35.197
No.

2:05:36.245 --> 2:05:38.375
Even though he yelled at them.

2:05:38.539 --> 2:05:40.039
And was always mean.

2:05:42.626 --> 2:05:44.746
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

2:05:50.384 --> 2:05:51.934
Well, of course not.

2:06:16.159 --> 2:06:17.329
What?

2:06:17.995 --> 2:06:19.125
It's just...

2:06:21.790 --> 2:06:24.500
some unspoken thing.

2:06:33.594 --> 2:06:35.684
It's beautiful.

2:06:37.181 --> 2:06:38.351
It is.

2:06:39.850 --> 2:06:42.020
And so are you.

2:06:43.979 --> 2:06:45.189
On the inside.

2:06:52.029 --> 2:06:53.859
Now there's a way

2:06:54.031 --> 2:06:58.031
And I know that I have to go away

2:06:59.703 --> 2:07:02.213
I know I have to go

2:08:41.305 --> 2:08:42.395
You know, it's a shame...

2:08:42.556 --> 2:08:46.936
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

2:08:47.102 --> 2:08:50.312
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

2:08:50.981 --> 2:08:51.981
I'm in.

2:08:52.149 --> 2:08:53.109
Dope.

2:08:53.275 --> 2:08:55.325
I miss you guys so much!

2:08:55.485 --> 2:08:56.735
Hell, yes.

2:08:59.781 --> 2:09:01.781
What say we steal some shit?

2:11:20.881 --> 2:11:22.801
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

2:11:24.051 --> 2:11:27.141
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

2:11:31.808 --> 2:11:34.768
When they see
what I have created here...

2:11:34.937 --> 2:11:36.977
their wrath will dissipate.

2:11:38.148 --> 2:11:41.148
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

2:11:42.569 --> 2:11:43.779
That, my child...

2:11:43.946 --> 2:11:45.906
is the next step in our evolution.

2:11:46.073 --> 2:11:49.123
More powerful, more beautiful...

2:11:49.284 --> 2:11:53.464
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

2:11:55.999 --> 2:11:58.589
I think I shall call him...

2:12:00.337 --> 2:12:01.837
Adam.

2:14:04.378 --> 2:14:05.208
Dude.

2:14:06.088 --> 2:14:07.628
Seriously?

2:14:07.798 --> 2:14:09.718
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

2:14:09.883 --> 2:14:11.303
I am Groot.

2:14:11.468 --> 2:14:13.388
I am not boring. You're boring.

2:14:13.554 --> 2:14:14.474
You know what's boring?

2:14:14.638 --> 2:14:17.718
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

2:14:17.891 --> 2:14:21.601
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

2:14:22.062 --> 2:14:23.232
I'm not boring!

2:14:23.397 --> 2:14:24.477
I am Groot.

2:14:26.149 --> 2:14:28.649
And now I know how Yondu felt.

2:15:04.438 --> 2:15:06.648
In these times of hardship...

2:15:07.774 --> 2:15:09.864
just remember...

2:15:10.444 --> 2:15:14.494
We. Are. Groot.

2:15:17.784 --> 2:15:18.954
Hey, fellas.

2:15:19.119 --> 2:15:20.789
Wait, where are you going?

2:15:20.954 --> 2:15:23.374
You were supposed to be my lift home.

2:15:23.540 --> 2:15:25.170
How will I get out of here?

2:15:25.334 --> 2:15:26.544
Hey! Aw, gee...

2:15:26.710 --> 2:15:29.460
I've got so many more stories to tell.

2:15:29.630 --> 2:15:30.880
Aw, guys.

2:15:31.048 --> 2:15:33.378
Oh, gee...
