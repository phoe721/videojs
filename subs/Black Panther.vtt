00:05.797 --> 00:06.878
Baba...

00:07.049 --> 00:08.256
<i>Yes, my son.</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:09.903
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:12.089
<i>Which one?</i>

00:12.429 --> 00:14.341
<i>The story of home.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:18.091
<i>Millions of years ago...</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:20.851
<i>a meteorite made of vibranium...</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:23.354
<i>the strongest substance
in the universe...</i>

00:23.524 --> 00:25.436
<i>struck the continent of Africa...</i>

00:27.611 --> 00:30.479
<i>affecting the plant life around it.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:32.648
<i>And when the time of man came...</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:36.659
<i>five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.</i>

00:39.373 --> 00:41.956
<i>The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.287
<i>until a warrior shaman...</i>

00:44.461 --> 00:47.420
<i>received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...</i>

00:47.589 --> 00:50.627
<i>who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

00:51.301 --> 00:53.112
<i>a plant that granted him</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:57.130
<i>superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.</i>

00:57.307 --> 00:58.718
<i>The warrior became king...</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:01.259
<i>and the first Black Panther...</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:04.019
<i>the protector of Wakanda.</i>

01:04.189 --> 01:07.023
<i>Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:11.527
<i>but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.</i>

01:12.322 --> 01:15.315
<i>The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:18.735
<i>more advanced
than any other nation.</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:20.574
<i>But as Wakanda thrived...</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:24.161
<i>the world around it descended
further into chaos.</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:29.545
<i>To keep vibranium safe...</i>

01:29.715 --> 01:32.674
<i>the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...</i>

01:33.594 --> 01:35.572
<i>keeping the truth of their power</i>

01:35.596 --> 01:37.588
<i>from the outside world.</i>

01:39.099 --> 01:40.965
<i>And we still hide,</i> Baba?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.016
<i>Yes.</i>

01:43.812 --> 01:44.893
<i>Why?</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:57.107
Lucky shot!
That ain't lucky!

01:57.284 --> 01:58.616
Whatever!
Get outta here!

01:58.744 --> 01:59.804
Check up.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.990
Pick your man up! He open.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.201
Where you at?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.161
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.496
Pass! Pass!

02:07.669 --> 02:08.785
Got you, E.
E, hurry up!

02:08.962 --> 02:10.453
Watch me get this.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.484
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.569
Come on.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.653
What you got?

02:15.677 --> 02:16.667
You ain't got nothing.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.781
Hey, look, if we get in and out quick,

02:18.805 --> 02:19.795
won't be no worries.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.930
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.328
Come around the corner.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.513
Land right here.
Mmm-hmm.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.302
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.708
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

02:33.028 --> 02:34.018
Hide the straps.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.363
Yo, is it the Feds?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.366
No.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.298
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.008
They're holding spears.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.592
Open it.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.470
You serious?

03:09.064 --> 03:11.181
They won't knock again.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.033
Who are you?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.247
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.464
Prove to me you are one of us.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.264
My King.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.268
Leave us.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.431
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...

03:52.607 --> 03:54.724
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.314
As you wish.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.603
At ease.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.165
Come, baby brother.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.041
Let me see
how you are holding up.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.214
You look strong.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.366
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.380
How is home?

04:29.352 --> 04:30.684
Not so good.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.644
Baby brother.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.180
There has been an attack.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.815
This man...

04:37.861 --> 04:38.897
Ulysses Klaue...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.317
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

04:42.491 --> 04:44.733
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.528
Many lives were lost.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.907
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

04:52.083 --> 04:53.619
and how to strike.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.710
He had someone on the inside.

04:57.589 --> 04:58.875
Why are you here?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.341
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

05:02.511 --> 05:05.424
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.214
I did no such thing.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.177
Tell him who you are.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.687
Zuri, son of Badu...

05:14.856 --> 05:15.846
What?

05:21.530 --> 05:24.133
James. James, you lied to me?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.218
Leave him.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.302
You were Wakandan this whole time?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.386
You betrayed Wakanda!

05:27.410 --> 05:28.471
How could you lie to me like...

05:28.495 --> 05:30.452
Stand down.

05:33.458 --> 05:37.327
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.557
Prince N'Jobu...

05:51.726 --> 05:53.342
you will return home at once...

05:53.520 --> 05:55.386
where you will face
the Council...

05:55.564 --> 05:58.227
and inform them of your crimes.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.755
Check up!

06:04.447 --> 06:06.404
Guard your man, guard your man!

06:07.701 --> 06:08.691
Yo.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.730
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda</i>

07:00.754 --> 07:03.622
<i>is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

07:03.798 --> 07:06.290
<i>The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...</i>

07:06.468 --> 07:07.612
<i>after a terrorist attack</i>

07:07.636 --> 07:09.298
<i>at the United Nations
a week ago.</i>

07:09.471 --> 07:12.700
<i>The suspect
has since been apprehended.</i>

07:12.724 --> 07:13.826
<i>Though it remains one of</i>

07:13.850 --> 07:14.966
<i>the poorest countries
in the world...</i>

07:15.143 --> 07:16.884
<i>fortified by mountain ranges...</i>

07:17.062 --> 07:18.678
<i>and an impenetrable
rainforest...</i>

07:18.855 --> 07:21.000
<i>Wakanda does not engage</i>

07:21.024 --> 07:23.687
<i>in international trade
or accept aid.</i>

07:23.860 --> 07:25.101
<i>The succession of the throne...</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:26.547
<i>is expected to fall
to the oldest</i>

07:26.571 --> 07:27.857
<i>of the king's two children...</i>

07:28.031 --> 07:29.363
<i>Prince T'Challa.</i>

07:30.992 --> 07:32.233
My Prince...

07:32.410 --> 07:34.322
coming up on them now.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.761
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.012
Hmm.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.937
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.196
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.906
What are you talking about?

08:17.956 --> 08:19.697
I never freeze.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.826
What's going on?

08:36.850 --> 08:40.389
It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.678
The car no start.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.166
What happened?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.522
The engine failed.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.184
Ours, too.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.482
What is it, Captain?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.479
Defense positions.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.869
Defense positions.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.379
Are we under attack?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.959
Defense positions.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.258
Get around to the side.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.302
Defense positions.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.632
Hey. Defense positions!

09:22.520 --> 09:23.681
No games.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.204
What do you see?

09:54.677 --> 09:56.822
Come in. Come in.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.257
Over there! Look back!

09:59.099 --> 10:00.089
Watch out!

10:25.959 --> 10:27.325
T'Challa, no!

10:28.128 --> 10:29.744
This one's just a boy.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.317
He got kidnapped as well.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.331
Nakia...

10:38.763 --> 10:39.924
I...

10:42.308 --> 10:43.640
I wanted...
Hey!

10:43.810 --> 10:46.473
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

10:46.855 --> 10:48.391
I will shoot her right now.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.150
You froze.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.148
Ah...

11:01.828 --> 11:04.992
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.370
My father is dead, Nakia.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.540
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.585
And I wish for you to be there.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.451
Carry yourselves home now.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.536
Thank you.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.051
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.514
Thank you oh.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.396
You will speak
nothing of this day.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.897
Yes.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.773
Thank you.

11:42.827 --> 11:43.817
Thank you.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.566
Sister Nakia...

12:20.949 --> 12:22.531
My Prince...

12:23.451 --> 12:24.942
we are home.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.855
This never gets old.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.036
Queen Mother...

13:59.797 --> 14:00.958
Princess...

14:01.341 --> 14:03.048
My comfort for your loss.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.253
Thank you, Nakia.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.044
It is so good
to have you back with us.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.366
Take her to the River Province

14:09.390 --> 14:10.597
to prepare her for the ceremony.

14:10.767 --> 14:11.928
Yes, General.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.226
Did he freeze?

14:22.737 --> 14:24.757
Like an antelope in headlights.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.322
Are you finished?

14:32.038 --> 14:34.350
So surprised
my little sister came

14:34.374 --> 14:36.286
to see me off
before our big day.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.519
You wish!

14:37.543 --> 14:40.286
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.625
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.256
How many times
do I have to teach you?

14:44.425 --> 14:45.694
Just because something works

14:45.718 --> 14:47.425
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.757
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.055
More than you.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.722
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

14:55.895 --> 14:57.807
to your ceremonial outfit.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.396
Shuri!

15:01.067 --> 15:02.183
Sorry, Mother!

15:03.069 --> 15:05.026
How are you feeling today, Mama?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.566
Proud.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.325
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.862
He is with us...

15:15.039 --> 15:18.077
and it is your time to be king.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.893
Good morning.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.561
How can I help you?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.668
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.919
They tell me you're the expert.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.230
Ah. You could say that.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.066
They're beautiful.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.691
Where's this one from?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.326
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

15:54.495 --> 15:55.736
present day Ghana...

15:55.913 --> 15:56.994
19th century.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.155
For real?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.158
What about this one?

16:03.004 --> 16:04.961
That one's from the Edo people of Benin...

16:05.131 --> 16:06.997
16th century.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.091
Now, tell me about this one.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.119
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.226
Fula tribe, I believe.

16:20.438 --> 16:21.770
Nah.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.597
I beg your pardon?

16:23.774 --> 16:25.711
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

16:25.735 --> 16:26.896
but it's from Wakanda.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.560
And it's made out of vibranium.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.426
Don't trip.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.907
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.285
These items aren't for sale.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.034
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

16:40.208 --> 16:41.699
You think they paid
a fair price?

16:41.876 --> 16:44.038
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.190
Sir, I'm going to have to

16:46.214 --> 16:47.671
ask you to leave.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.359
You got
all this security in here

16:49.383 --> 16:50.874
watching me
ever since I walked in.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.488
But you ain't checking for

16:52.512 --> 16:54.615
what you put in your body.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.949
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.509
Come on, mate. Time.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.140
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.684
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

17:01.854 --> 17:04.562
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

17:04.732 --> 17:05.834
Medical emergency right away

17:05.858 --> 17:07.224
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.462
Look out.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.103
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.988
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.491
I'm gonna take a break.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.868
Let's give the
lady some space, please.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.143
Step back, please, gents.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.453
Step back, please.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.213
Hey, come here.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.251
Come here. It's okay.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.137
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

17:43.354 --> 17:44.873
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

17:44.897 --> 17:45.958
Because it's better to leave

17:45.982 --> 17:47.018
the crime scene more spread out.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.899
Makes us look like amateurs.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.938
Now then, let's see if you know

18:07.962 --> 18:09.544
what you're talking about.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.428
That's just a taste.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.147
You're gonna be a rich boy.
You better sell that quick.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.941
It's already sold!

18:39.744 --> 18:40.804
Whatever you try,

18:40.828 --> 18:41.930
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.473
That'll make my day.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.783
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.250
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

18:49.420 --> 18:51.207
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.874
Onward!

19:34.215 --> 19:35.331
Onward!

20:53.335 --> 20:54.871
I, Zuri...

20:55.588 --> 20:57.170
son of Badu...

20:57.465 --> 20:59.081
give to you...

20:59.258 --> 21:01.420
Prince T'Challa...

21:01.594 --> 21:03.363
the Black Panther!

21:08.267 --> 21:09.803
The prince...

21:09.977 --> 21:14.597
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

21:14.774 --> 21:17.016
stripped away.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.845
Praise the ancestors.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.308
Praise the ancestors.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.480
Victory in ritual combat...

21:56.649 --> 22:00.188
comes by yield or death.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.900
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

22:04.073 --> 22:05.905
I now offer...

22:06.575 --> 22:09.596
a path to the throne.

22:13.332 --> 22:18.021
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:19.922 --> 22:24.110
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.825
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.725
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.808
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

22:38.649 --> 22:41.892
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

22:45.656 --> 22:48.490
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

22:48.659 --> 22:51.902
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

22:52.538 --> 22:53.574
Mother!

23:18.439 --> 23:20.476
Are they Jabari?
Yes.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.193
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.321
It's challenge day.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.161
We have watched...

23:44.006 --> 23:46.293
and listened from the mountains!

23:46.467 --> 23:48.424
We have watched with disgust...

23:48.594 --> 23:51.448
as your
technological advancements

23:51.472 --> 23:53.555
have been overseen by a child!

23:57.186 --> 23:59.599
Who scoffs at tradition!

24:00.397 --> 24:03.335
And now you want to
hand the nation

24:03.359 --> 24:05.271
over to this prince...

24:06.070 --> 24:11.407
who could not keep
his own father safe.

24:13.827 --> 24:14.988
Mmm?

24:16.372 --> 24:18.079
We will not have it.

24:18.248 --> 24:22.333
I said, we will not have it, oh!

24:22.503 --> 24:24.995
I, M'Baku...

24:26.465 --> 24:28.252
leader of the Jabari...

24:28.425 --> 24:32.715
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.926
Glory to Hanuman.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.201
Jabari!

24:56.912 --> 24:57.902
Dora Milaje!

24:58.414 --> 24:59.325
Onward!

25:06.505 --> 25:09.248
Let the challenge begin!

25:20.561 --> 25:21.847
Oh!

25:24.648 --> 25:25.638
Stand up!

25:34.908 --> 25:36.615
Come!

25:44.126 --> 25:46.209
T'Challa!

25:51.300 --> 25:52.882
Where is your god now?

26:03.228 --> 26:04.810
Yes!

26:12.654 --> 26:14.441
No powers.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.239
No claws.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.195
No special suit, oh!

26:19.369 --> 26:22.407
Just a boy not fit to lead!

26:22.581 --> 26:25.643
Show him who you are!

26:42.017 --> 26:43.849
I am Prince T'Challa...

26:44.019 --> 26:45.601
son of King T'Chaka!

26:45.771 --> 26:47.457
You can do this, T'Challa!

27:01.203 --> 27:02.193
Yes!

27:02.746 --> 27:03.736
Come on!

27:03.914 --> 27:06.076
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.832
I would rather die!

27:11.255 --> 27:12.245
T'Challa!

27:13.465 --> 27:14.455
T'Challa!

27:15.217 --> 27:16.207
T'Challa!

27:17.219 --> 27:18.209
T'Challa!

27:19.054 --> 27:20.115
T'Challa!

27:20.139 --> 27:21.255
You have fought with honor!

27:21.431 --> 27:24.014
Now yield!
Your people need you.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.174
T'Challa!

27:25.602 --> 27:26.663
T'Challa!

27:26.687 --> 27:27.848
Yield, man!

27:28.021 --> 27:29.262
T'Challa!

27:29.690 --> 27:30.680
T'Challa!

27:32.526 --> 27:35.018
Yes! Yes!

27:56.592 --> 27:59.175
I now present to you...

27:59.344 --> 28:01.677
King T'Challa...

28:03.390 --> 28:06.258
the Black Panther.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.390
Zuri.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.525
My King.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.821
Wakanda forever!

28:27.998 --> 28:30.081
Wakanda forever!

29:02.366 --> 29:04.028
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

29:04.201 --> 29:07.365
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

29:08.413 --> 29:11.406
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

29:14.962 --> 29:15.998
T'Chaka...

29:16.171 --> 29:19.164
we call on you.

29:19.341 --> 29:22.209
Come here to your son.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.184
Praise the ancestors.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.063
Father.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.735
My son.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.583
I'm sorry.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.540
Stand up.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.921
You are a king.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.847
What is wrong my son?

31:41.274 --> 31:43.607
I am not ready.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.777
Have you not prepared

31:46.947 --> 31:51.157
to be king your whole life?

31:51.576 --> 31:54.865
Have you not trained
and studied,

31:55.205 --> 31:57.868
been by my side?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.285
That is not
what I am talking about.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.422
I am not ready
to be without you.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.658
A man who has not prepared
his children

32:13.682 --> 32:15.218
for his own death...

32:15.392 --> 32:17.554
has failed as a father.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.265
Have I ever failed you?

32:20.981 --> 32:22.313
Never.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.563
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.281
I want to be a great king, <i>Baba.</i>

32:36.830 --> 32:38.241
Just like you.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.827
You're going to struggle.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.895
So you'll need to
surround yourself

32:42.919 --> 32:44.626
with people you trust.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.039
You're a good man
with a good heart.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.547
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.343
Breathe.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.054
T'Challa, breathe.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.229
Breathe.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.773
He was there.

33:07.444 --> 33:10.528
He was there. My father.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.369
Just one?

33:34.221 --> 33:36.053
Come home, Nakia.

33:36.223 --> 33:37.464
I'm right here.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.098
Stay.

33:39.768 --> 33:43.261
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

33:43.438 --> 33:44.804
but I can't stay.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.808
I found my calling out there.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.437
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.446
I can't be happy here...

33:54.616 --> 33:57.324
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

33:58.787 --> 34:01.370
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

34:02.082 --> 34:03.664
Share what we have.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.324
We could provide aid...

34:05.502 --> 34:06.562
and access to technology

34:06.586 --> 34:07.793
and refuge to those who need it.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.413
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.005
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.087
If the world found out
what we truly are...

34:18.265 --> 34:19.756
what we possess...

34:19.933 --> 34:21.595
we could lose our way of life.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.121
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

34:24.145 --> 34:25.977
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

34:27.774 --> 34:30.687
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.318
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

34:33.488 --> 34:36.981
Ah! See, you admit it!
If that's what I wanted.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.743
Is that him?

34:47.961 --> 34:50.999
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.497
Of course.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.334
I see Nakia is back.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.007
You guys going to work it out?

35:05.353 --> 35:06.469
T'Challa...

35:07.188 --> 35:08.724
what's wrong?

35:08.898 --> 35:10.480
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.640
More, like what?

35:11.818 --> 35:14.060
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.069
You let the refugees in...

35:16.740 --> 35:18.697
they bring their problems
with them.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.154
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.864
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

35:26.833 --> 35:28.603
to go out there
and clean up the world,

35:28.627 --> 35:30.243
then I'll be all for it.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.690
But waging war
on other countries

35:32.714 --> 35:34.296
has never been our way.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.044
You, too, huh?

35:40.221 --> 35:41.883
Bast! We're in trouble.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.009
<i>My King.</i>

35:46.936 --> 35:47.926
<i>My love.</i>

35:48.104 --> 35:51.563
<i>You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.</i>

35:55.362 --> 35:57.149
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

35:57.322 --> 35:59.985
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

36:01.284 --> 36:04.277
We have learned Ulysses Klaue...

36:04.454 --> 36:07.288
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

36:07.457 --> 36:08.789
in South Korea...

36:08.958 --> 36:10.369
tomorrow night.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.956
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

36:16.925 --> 36:20.384
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.637
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

36:23.807 --> 36:28.427
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

36:28.853 --> 36:29.843
We need a king.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.684
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.628
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

36:35.652 --> 36:37.735
about what Klaue took from us.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.354
From me.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.445
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.804
Take me with you.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.820
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

36:46.996 --> 36:50.034
I need you here
protecting the border.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.449
Then I ask...

36:51.626 --> 36:53.743
you kill him where he stands...

36:53.920 --> 36:56.003
or you bring him back to us.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.292
You have my word.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.168
I will bring him back.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.675
We will proceed
with the mission.

37:51.728 --> 37:52.718
My King!

37:52.896 --> 37:54.637
Stop it. Stop it.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.813
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.311
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

38:02.739 --> 38:03.820
Okoye.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.398
And Nakia as well.

38:08.286 --> 38:12.030
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

38:12.499 --> 38:13.580
Yes.

38:14.751 --> 38:15.853
We'll be fine.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.789
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.123
Yes!

38:19.297 --> 38:21.664
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.208
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.781
Unlimited range,

38:26.805 --> 38:29.548
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.056
Check these out.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.386
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.351
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.058
Ah.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.191
And what are these?

38:42.362 --> 38:45.341
The real question is
what are those?

38:46.449 --> 38:47.906
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

38:48.076 --> 38:50.068
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

38:50.245 --> 38:53.033
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.184
I bet the Elders loved that.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.366
Try them on.

39:01.464 --> 39:02.500
Fully automated.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.236
Like the old American movie
<i>Baba</i> used to watch.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.320
Mmm.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.506
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.672
Interesting.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.591
Guess what I call them.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.134
Sneakers.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.096
Because you...

39:18.273 --> 39:19.434
Never mind.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.316
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

39:22.485 --> 39:26.650
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

39:26.823 --> 39:27.939
Exhibit A.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.652
My design.
Old tech.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.068
Old?
Functional, but old.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.973
"Hey, people are shooting at me.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.954
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

39:36.124 --> 39:37.706
Enough.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.750
Now, look at these.

39:43.506 --> 39:44.713
Do you like that one?

39:44.883 --> 39:46.169
Tempting.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.384
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.212
This one.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.934
Now tell it to go on.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.486
Ooh!

40:08.406 --> 40:11.695
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.988
Strike it.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.161
Anywhere?
Mmm-hmm.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.287
Not that hard, genius!

40:21.461 --> 40:23.669
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.190
I invite you to my lab,

40:25.214 --> 40:26.671
and you just kick things around?

40:26.841 --> 40:29.612
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

40:29.636 --> 40:30.738
Hey.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.298
Wait a minute.

40:32.472 --> 40:35.180
The nanites absorb
the kinetic energy...

40:35.350 --> 40:37.763
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.268
Very nice.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.100
Strike it again
in the same spot.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.267
You're recording?

40:46.861 --> 40:48.602
For research purposes.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.244
Delete that footage.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.845
This way.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.470
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

41:23.648 --> 41:26.641
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

41:26.818 --> 41:30.027
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.859
What? It's a disgrace.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.488
Hello Sophia.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.994
Good to see you.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.871
Who are these two?

41:42.041 --> 41:44.144
My friends from Kenya.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.626
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.504
Good for trouble...

41:49.674 --> 41:51.256
like you?

42:00.101 --> 42:01.558
Thank you!

42:24.375 --> 42:25.661
Spread out.

42:25.835 --> 42:28.202
The buyer
is likely already here.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.805
The woman outside.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.003
What trouble
was she referring to?

42:51.027 --> 42:53.881
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

42:53.905 --> 42:55.737
with some ivory traders.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.010
Made a bit of a mess.
Hmm.

42:58.034 --> 43:00.262
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

43:00.286 --> 43:02.198
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

43:02.371 --> 43:03.532
Depends...

43:03.706 --> 43:05.914
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.916
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

43:09.670 --> 43:10.956
Thank you.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.580
Over here.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.132
One whiskey, please.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.559
Eyes up. Americans.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.355
I count three.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.730
Five.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.301
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

43:39.325 --> 43:40.566
there behind you?

43:40.743 --> 43:41.859
Six.

43:42.036 --> 43:45.450
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.206
It just got
a little more complicated.

43:51.504 --> 43:52.620
Agent Ross.

43:52.797 --> 43:53.913
Your Highness.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.005
You are buying from Klaue.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.710
What I'm doing or not doing...

43:59.887 --> 44:01.365
on behalf of
the U.S. government

44:01.389 --> 44:02.596
is none of your concern.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.427
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

44:04.600 --> 44:06.683
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

44:06.853 --> 44:08.139
I gave you Zemo.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.678
Didn't I keep it under wraps...

44:09.856 --> 44:11.542
that the king of
a third world country

44:11.566 --> 44:13.523
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

44:13.693 --> 44:15.059
I'd say we were even.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.818
You really need to leave, now.

44:17.446 --> 44:20.780
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

44:21.868 --> 44:23.484
You've been warned.

44:25.413 --> 44:26.449
Three, craps.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.322
Hey, you won!

44:29.876 --> 44:31.162
You know what?

44:31.335 --> 44:33.327
I think I'll just take these...

44:33.504 --> 44:35.274
bring them over here

44:35.298 --> 44:37.631
and hold on for safekeeping.
Mmm-hmm.

44:40.261 --> 44:43.345
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.221
He cannot leave with Klaue.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.757
All right.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.371
Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia

44:49.395 --> 44:50.385
links back to a person...

44:50.563 --> 44:51.748
that I'm not actually saying

44:51.772 --> 44:52.762
I'm here to make a deal with...

44:52.940 --> 44:55.307
but that deal
will not be called off.

44:55.484 --> 44:56.795
When the dust settles,

44:56.819 --> 44:58.355
you and me can work
something out.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.395
I'm not here to make a deal.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.303
Klaue, plus eight!

45:29.644 --> 45:30.634
General.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.677
In position to secure our exit.

45:32.855 --> 45:33.845
And the vibranium?

45:33.981 --> 45:35.643
I don't see it yet.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.399
<i>I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.</i>

45:38.569 --> 45:40.310
There's not supposed to be.

45:40.488 --> 45:42.855
Somebody did not get the memo.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.365
Definitely armed.

45:46.202 --> 45:48.068
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.407
You got a mixtape coming out?

45:49.580 --> 45:52.197
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.241
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

45:54.418 --> 45:55.704
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

45:55.878 --> 45:57.460
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.371
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

46:00.216 --> 46:01.957
You think they're for you?

46:03.094 --> 46:04.255
Don't worry.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.365
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

46:06.389 --> 46:07.550
thank you very much.

46:14.981 --> 46:17.473
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

46:18.192 --> 46:19.728
You got the diamonds?

46:20.444 --> 46:22.185
Okay. That's enough.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.690
We need to move on Klaue.
<i>Stand down.</i>

46:27.118 --> 46:28.780
We can't afford a shootout.

46:28.953 --> 46:29.943
Vibranium?

46:39.255 --> 46:41.372
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

46:41.549 --> 46:44.041
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.126
It's now or never.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.420
Stand down!

46:48.014 --> 46:48.720
Hey!

47:02.695 --> 47:04.027
Wakandans!
They're here!

47:06.490 --> 47:08.072
Get outta here!
Kill 'em all!

47:09.952 --> 47:11.318
Diamonds, quick!

48:08.094 --> 48:09.154
Murderer!

48:15.643 --> 48:18.038
You know, you look just like
your old man.

48:27.488 --> 48:29.925
I made it rain!

48:29.949 --> 48:31.656
Let's get out of here, boss!

48:35.496 --> 48:38.364
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

48:38.541 --> 48:41.079
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

48:42.962 --> 48:45.420
Do we just leave him?
He'll catch up.

48:53.681 --> 48:54.797
Shuri!

48:58.394 --> 48:59.384
Yes!

48:59.562 --> 49:01.975
<i>Remote driving system activated.</i>

49:02.815 --> 49:04.584
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

49:04.608 --> 49:05.724
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

49:05.901 --> 49:07.233
<i>Just drive!</i>
Okay, calm down!

49:15.494 --> 49:17.201
Whoo! Let's go!

49:17.371 --> 49:19.579
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

49:23.210 --> 49:24.667
Which one is he in now?

49:26.964 --> 49:28.296
Hey, split up!

49:30.092 --> 49:31.628
They're trying to lose us.
I'll take the right.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.463
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

49:52.656 --> 49:53.772
We're not going to make it!

49:55.451 --> 49:56.532
Keep going!

50:02.750 --> 50:04.616
Whoo! Brother!

50:14.261 --> 50:15.593
Hey, what was that?

50:15.763 --> 50:17.755
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.309
Guns.

50:31.612 --> 50:32.853
So primitive!

50:33.030 --> 50:34.925
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

50:34.949 --> 50:36.110
The bullets won't penetrate!

50:38.327 --> 50:39.363
What are you doing?

50:39.537 --> 50:40.744
Just drive.

50:57.388 --> 50:58.799
Whoo!
Shit!

51:12.152 --> 51:13.814
Hey, look at your suit.

51:13.988 --> 51:15.173
You've been taking bullets,

51:15.197 --> 51:17.063
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

51:18.951 --> 51:20.158
Pull around the truck.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.206
Where'd he go?

51:35.593 --> 51:36.925
You show-off.

51:38.178 --> 51:39.168
There he is!

51:41.599 --> 51:42.589
Hold tight!

51:46.520 --> 51:47.556
All right.
Let's have some fun!

52:15.924 --> 52:16.914
Hop in.

52:17.426 --> 52:19.793
Put that spear in the trunk.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.133
Faster, Shuri.

52:26.310 --> 52:27.926
I'm going as fast as I can!

52:29.605 --> 52:30.812
Take a right! Take a right!

52:35.527 --> 52:36.608
No, no, no!

52:38.280 --> 52:40.067
Brother!

53:03.555 --> 53:04.591
Klaue!

53:06.767 --> 53:08.349
Did you think we would forget?

53:17.528 --> 53:19.360
Look at me, murderer!

53:20.406 --> 53:21.772
Where did you get this weapon?

53:22.157 --> 53:24.678
You savages didn't deserve it.

53:27.287 --> 53:30.746
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

53:30.916 --> 53:33.033
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.451
King!

53:35.087 --> 53:36.953
The world watches.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.109
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

53:44.805 --> 53:45.795
Yeah.

54:00.529 --> 54:01.770
Hello.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.512
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.376
So this is a big mess, huh?

54:17.546 --> 54:19.754
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.209
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

54:22.468 --> 54:25.176
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

54:28.223 --> 54:31.286
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

54:31.310 --> 54:34.223
than to make a scene here.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.791
After your questioning,

54:36.815 --> 54:38.727
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

54:38.901 --> 54:41.439
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

54:41.612 --> 54:44.400
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

54:44.573 --> 54:46.301
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor

54:46.325 --> 54:47.907
by letting you even be in here.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.737
If he touches you again,

54:52.956 --> 54:55.664
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

54:56.585 --> 54:57.917
Does she speak English?

54:58.295 --> 55:00.002
When she wants to.

55:00.839 --> 55:01.941
Huh.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.067
I'm going in.

55:03.091 --> 55:05.253
When I'm done, you guys are up.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.168
Agent Ross.
Yeah?

55:07.721 --> 55:10.634
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

55:11.183 --> 55:12.390
You see that?

55:12.976 --> 55:14.137
It's called diplomacy.

55:15.270 --> 55:16.331
You're welcome.

55:16.355 --> 55:17.415
(KLAUE SINGS <i>WHAT IS LOVE</i>

55:18.524 --> 55:20.668
Okoye.

55:20.692 --> 55:21.773
Play nice.

55:21.944 --> 55:23.025
Americans.

55:35.082 --> 55:36.994
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.453
I'm much more your speed.

55:38.627 --> 55:40.459
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

55:40.629 --> 55:43.121
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

55:43.298 --> 55:44.459
Where'd you get that?

55:44.633 --> 55:46.340
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

55:46.510 --> 55:48.877
But I can get you one,
if you like.

55:49.054 --> 55:50.949
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

55:50.973 --> 55:52.009
and I'll ask them.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.639
He's right outside.

55:53.809 --> 55:55.391
Why don't you ask him yourself?

55:55.561 --> 55:57.052
What? T'Challa?

55:57.229 --> 56:00.563
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

56:00.732 --> 56:01.722
Bingo.

56:03.026 --> 56:06.064
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

56:06.238 --> 56:07.479
Um...

56:08.657 --> 56:10.740
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.195
<i>It's all a front.</i>

56:12.828 --> 56:15.411
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

56:15.581 --> 56:18.039
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

56:18.208 --> 56:20.541
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i>

56:20.711 --> 56:23.579
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

56:23.755 --> 56:25.542
A technological marvel.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.194
All because it was built
on a mound

56:28.218 --> 56:30.255
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

56:30.429 --> 56:33.513
<i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.

56:34.099 --> 56:35.215
Vibranium.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.554
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

56:37.728 --> 56:38.935
It's not just a metal.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.642
They sew it into their clothes.

56:41.815 --> 56:44.603
It powers their city,
their tech...

56:44.776 --> 56:46.017
their weapons.

56:46.695 --> 56:47.776
Weapons?

56:47.946 --> 56:49.007
Yeah.

56:49.031 --> 56:51.444
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

56:51.617 --> 56:52.969
That's a nice fairy tale,

56:52.993 --> 56:54.905
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

56:55.078 --> 56:57.536
and you stole
all their vibranium.

56:57.706 --> 56:58.992
I stole...

57:02.377 --> 57:03.618
All of it?

57:04.922 --> 57:07.505
I took a tiny piece of it.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.381
They have a mountain full of it.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.759
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i>

57:11.929 --> 57:14.171
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

57:14.348 --> 57:16.367
<i>I'm the only outsider
who's seen it</i>

57:16.391 --> 57:17.973
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

57:18.518 --> 57:19.871
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

57:19.895 --> 57:23.138
<i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.</i>

57:23.482 --> 57:26.065
What his claws are made of.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.756
Your father told the UN...

57:50.926 --> 57:53.839
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.548
But now he's telling me
you have more.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.200
And you believe the word

57:57.224 --> 57:59.786
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

58:17.369 --> 58:19.611
Where is that?

58:20.539 --> 58:22.371
Back there.

58:34.177 --> 58:35.509
How much more are you hiding?

58:37.597 --> 58:38.838
Something is happening out back.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.099
Get down!

58:50.610 --> 58:52.021
Stand down!

58:55.574 --> 58:56.564
Cover!

58:56.700 --> 58:57.690
Grenade!

59:00.954 --> 59:03.571
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

59:23.393 --> 59:24.554
My King!

59:27.856 --> 59:29.017
My King.

59:29.191 --> 59:30.307
Nakia.

59:33.070 --> 59:34.922
He just jumped in front of me.

59:37.699 --> 59:39.427
I don't think
he'll make it here.

59:39.451 --> 59:40.817
It hit his spine.

59:43.455 --> 59:45.162
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.481
This will stabilize him for now.

59:59.471 --> 1:00:00.962
Give him to us.

1:00:01.890 --> 1:00:03.381
We can save him.

1:00:12.317 --> 1:00:14.809
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

1:00:15.946 --> 1:00:17.278
We failed.

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:20.656
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

1:00:20.826 --> 1:00:23.364
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

1:00:23.537 --> 1:00:24.778
He took a bullet for me.

1:00:24.955 --> 1:00:26.662
That was his choice.

1:00:27.374 --> 1:00:29.366
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

1:00:29.543 --> 1:00:31.375
Let us consider
that we heal him.

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:34.791
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

1:00:35.632 --> 1:00:37.624
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

1:00:37.801 --> 1:00:40.214
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

1:00:40.846 --> 1:00:44.010
I cannot just let him die...

1:00:44.850 --> 1:00:47.217
knowing we can save him.

1:00:47.394 --> 1:00:49.807
Where exactly are we taking him?

1:00:57.445 --> 1:01:00.233
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

1:01:00.407 --> 1:01:02.364
This is going to be fun.

1:01:09.457 --> 1:01:10.698
He will live.

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:16.332
W'Kabi is here.

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:27.973
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

1:01:28.518 --> 1:01:30.009
He's not here.

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:36.102
He slipped through our hands.

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:38.901
"Slipped"?

1:01:40.864 --> 1:01:44.653
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

1:01:44.826 --> 1:01:47.034
With you,
I thought it'd be different.

1:01:48.079 --> 1:01:49.911
But it's more of the same.

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:11.433
Let's get going, boss.

1:02:12.979 --> 1:02:14.811
You always sell to the CIA?

1:02:14.981 --> 1:02:16.893
I sell to the highest bidder.

1:02:17.067 --> 1:02:19.184
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

1:02:19.361 --> 1:02:20.713
and I lay low for a bit,

1:02:20.737 --> 1:02:22.148
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:24.091
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:25.105
I know you good for it.

1:02:25.283 --> 1:02:27.929
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

1:02:27.953 --> 1:02:29.013
You don't want to go there, boy.

1:02:29.037 --> 1:02:30.027
Yeah, I do.

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:33.989
Drop it!

1:02:34.459 --> 1:02:36.687
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

1:02:36.711 --> 1:02:37.997
ends today.

1:02:38.171 --> 1:02:39.537
Put your gun down now!

1:02:39.714 --> 1:02:41.296
I'm sorry.

1:02:41.466 --> 1:02:43.708
Sorry, Erik.
It's gonna be okay.

1:03:12.330 --> 1:03:14.617
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

1:03:15.667 --> 1:03:17.124
They're savages.

1:03:17.919 --> 1:03:21.208
This is what they do
to people like us.

1:03:21.381 --> 1:03:22.542
I ain't worried about no brand.

1:03:22.716 --> 1:03:24.173
Check these out.

1:03:25.510 --> 1:03:26.876
Each one is for a kill.

1:03:27.345 --> 1:03:30.053
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

1:03:30.223 --> 1:03:33.011
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

1:03:33.184 --> 1:03:35.471
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:45.381
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

1:03:59.627 --> 1:04:00.913
Leave us!

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:15.341
So your mission did not go
as planned.

1:04:16.436 --> 1:04:20.100
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

1:04:20.815 --> 1:04:23.603
My father told me
he disappeared.

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:26.143
There was a man today...

1:04:27.072 --> 1:04:31.032
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

1:04:32.577 --> 1:04:34.569
That is not possible.

1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:38.448
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

1:04:38.625 --> 1:04:40.867
My grandfather's ring!

1:04:41.044 --> 1:04:42.646
Do not tell me what is possible.

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:43.706
Tell me the truth!

1:04:48.510 --> 1:04:50.001
Some truths...

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:56.465
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

1:04:57.477 --> 1:04:59.969
That is not your choice to make.

1:05:00.855 --> 1:05:01.916
What happened to him?

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:03.476
I promised the king
to say nothing.

1:05:03.650 --> 1:05:05.482
I am your king now!

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:23.413
Your uncle took...

1:05:24.671 --> 1:05:28.585
a War Dog assignment in America.

1:05:31.386 --> 1:05:32.593
Your father...

1:05:33.388 --> 1:05:35.095
placed me there...

1:05:35.974 --> 1:05:36.964
<i>to observe...</i>

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:40.643
unbeknownst to him.

1:05:40.812 --> 1:05:43.725
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

1:05:44.315 --> 1:05:45.522
They had a child.

1:05:46.943 --> 1:05:49.276
The hardships he saw there...

1:05:50.655 --> 1:05:52.738
radicalized your uncle.

1:05:52.907 --> 1:05:55.115
I observed
for as long as I could.

1:05:56.327 --> 1:05:57.943
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

1:05:58.121 --> 1:06:00.534
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

1:06:00.707 --> 1:06:03.074
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

1:06:03.543 --> 1:06:05.284
All over the planet...

1:06:05.462 --> 1:06:06.814
our people suffer because

1:06:06.838 --> 1:06:08.830
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

1:06:09.841 --> 1:06:11.193
With vibranium weapons,

1:06:11.217 --> 1:06:12.799
they could overthrow
every country...

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.822
and Wakanda could rule them all

1:06:14.846 --> 1:06:16.132
the right way.

1:06:16.306 --> 1:06:19.845
He knew your father
would not support this.

1:06:20.727 --> 1:06:23.811
So, your uncle betrayed us.

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.187
No!

1:06:25.356 --> 1:06:28.599
<i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i>

1:06:30.153 --> 1:06:31.564
No, no, no.

1:06:31.738 --> 1:06:33.320
You will return home at once...

1:06:33.490 --> 1:06:35.322
where you will face
the Council...

1:06:35.492 --> 1:06:38.451
and inform them of your crimes.

1:06:38.620 --> 1:06:40.327
<i>He drew his weapon on me.</i>

1:06:40.497 --> 1:06:42.739
No!

1:06:57.847 --> 1:07:01.591
<i>Your father killed his own brother...</i>

1:07:01.768 --> 1:07:05.637
to save my life.

1:07:09.526 --> 1:07:12.644
Speak nothing of this.

1:07:16.950 --> 1:07:18.316
And the child?

1:07:22.163 --> 1:07:23.699
We left him.

1:07:32.131 --> 1:07:33.292
We had to...

1:07:34.425 --> 1:07:35.586
maintain...

1:07:37.178 --> 1:07:38.339
the lie.

1:08:03.830 --> 1:08:05.241
What is this?

1:08:05.790 --> 1:08:07.281
Just a little gift.

1:08:31.149 --> 1:08:32.310
Who are you?

1:09:21.699 --> 1:09:23.190
All right, where am I?

1:09:23.743 --> 1:09:25.985
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!

1:09:26.579 --> 1:09:28.320
What?
My name is Everett.

1:09:28.748 --> 1:09:31.616
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

1:09:31.793 --> 1:09:34.581
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

1:09:35.088 --> 1:09:36.124
Right.

1:09:40.843 --> 1:09:42.254
Okay, is this Wakanda?

1:09:42.428 --> 1:09:44.044
No, it's Kansas.

1:09:47.225 --> 1:09:48.887
How long ago was Korea?

1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:50.176
Yesterday.

1:09:50.353 --> 1:09:51.413
I don't think so.

1:09:51.437 --> 1:09:53.791
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

1:09:53.815 --> 1:09:56.023
They do here.

1:09:56.192 --> 1:09:59.435
But not by magic, by technology.

1:10:03.658 --> 1:10:07.072
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

1:10:30.810 --> 1:10:33.268
These train things...

1:10:33.438 --> 1:10:35.680
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

1:10:35.857 --> 1:10:36.893
Obviously.

1:10:37.066 --> 1:10:41.310
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

1:10:43.906 --> 1:10:45.067
The light panels, what are they?

1:10:45.533 --> 1:10:47.741
<i>Sonic stabilizers.
Sonic what?</i>

1:10:48.119 --> 1:10:49.405
In its raw form...

1:10:49.579 --> 1:10:51.265
vibranium is too dangerous

1:10:51.289 --> 1:10:53.030
to be transported
at that speed...

1:10:53.207 --> 1:10:56.291
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

1:10:57.420 --> 1:10:58.911
<i>There's vibranium on those trains?</i>

1:10:59.088 --> 1:11:01.296
There's vibranium all around us.

1:11:03.050 --> 1:11:04.632
That's how I healed you.

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.180
<i>Where is T'Challa?</i>

1:11:14.353 --> 1:11:16.345
<i>His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.</i>

1:11:16.522 --> 1:11:18.764
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

1:11:18.941 --> 1:11:20.294
<i>A man showed up at the border</i>

1:11:20.318 --> 1:11:21.604
<i>who claims to have killed Klaue.</i>

1:11:21.778 --> 1:11:22.838
What?

1:11:22.862 --> 1:11:25.400
<i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i>

1:11:25.573 --> 1:11:27.405
<i>We need to find your brother!</i>

1:11:27.575 --> 1:11:28.565
An outsider?

1:11:28.743 --> 1:11:30.359
<i>No, a Wakandan.</i>

1:11:30.536 --> 1:11:31.947
He's not a Wakandan.

1:11:34.582 --> 1:11:35.789
He's one of ours.

1:11:48.805 --> 1:11:50.842
He killed his own brother...

1:11:51.015 --> 1:11:53.177
and left a child behind...

1:11:53.351 --> 1:11:54.592
with nothing.

1:11:56.562 --> 1:11:58.178
What kind of king...

1:12:00.107 --> 1:12:02.269
What kind of man does that?

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:04.651
No man is perfect.

1:12:05.530 --> 1:12:06.862
Not even your father.

1:12:07.031 --> 1:12:09.739
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

1:12:11.619 --> 1:12:14.703
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

1:12:16.123 --> 1:12:18.160
he may have created something
even worse.

1:12:18.584 --> 1:12:19.574
Hey.

1:12:21.420 --> 1:12:22.581
Look at me.

1:12:25.716 --> 1:12:29.710
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

1:12:31.347 --> 1:12:35.967
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

1:12:42.066 --> 1:12:44.649
<i>Brother, you need to
get here now!</i>

1:12:45.069 --> 1:12:46.355
Erik Stevens.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:49.028
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

1:12:49.198 --> 1:12:51.110
MIT for grad school.

1:12:51.284 --> 1:12:53.446
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

1:12:53.619 --> 1:12:55.097
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

1:12:55.121 --> 1:12:56.202
like it was a video game.

1:12:56.664 --> 1:12:58.405
Started calling him Killmonger.

1:12:58.583 --> 1:13:01.246
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

1:13:01.419 --> 1:13:02.830
They will drop off the grid...

1:13:03.004 --> 1:13:04.314
so they can
commit assassinations

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:05.454
and take down governments.

1:13:06.299 --> 1:13:09.667
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

1:13:10.011 --> 1:13:11.502
He has a War Dog tattoo...

1:13:12.179 --> 1:13:14.762
but we have no record of him.

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:23.312
Is this man Wakandan or not?

1:13:24.567 --> 1:13:26.354
Tell us what is going on.

1:13:45.796 --> 1:13:46.832
Speak.

1:13:47.256 --> 1:13:48.246
Speak.

1:13:50.217 --> 1:13:52.459
I'm standing in your house...

1:13:52.637 --> 1:13:54.072
serving justice to a man

1:13:54.096 --> 1:13:56.383
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

1:13:57.224 --> 1:13:58.510
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

1:14:04.023 --> 1:14:06.606
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:09.171
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

1:14:09.195 --> 1:14:11.232
is because I know who you are.

1:14:12.531 --> 1:14:14.193
Now, what do you want?

1:14:15.743 --> 1:14:17.512
I want the throne.

1:14:18.955 --> 1:14:20.223
My goodness.

1:14:22.750 --> 1:14:24.958
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

1:14:25.586 --> 1:14:27.077
Must feel good.

1:14:27.797 --> 1:14:29.358
It's about two billion people

1:14:29.382 --> 1:14:30.998
all over the world
that looks like us.

1:14:31.592 --> 1:14:33.549
But their lives
are a lot harder.

1:14:33.719 --> 1:14:36.006
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

1:14:36.180 --> 1:14:38.388
And what tools are those?

1:14:38.975 --> 1:14:41.638
Vibranium. Your weapons.

1:14:41.811 --> 1:14:45.430
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:49.350
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1:14:49.527 --> 1:14:51.359
for people who are not our own.

1:14:51.946 --> 1:14:53.403
Not your own?

1:14:53.572 --> 1:14:56.030
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:57.611
So ain't all people your people?

1:14:57.785 --> 1:15:01.404
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1:15:02.289 --> 1:15:04.226
And it is my responsibility

1:15:04.250 --> 1:15:06.116
to make sure
our people are safe...

1:15:06.293 --> 1:15:08.563
and that vibranium does not fall

1:15:08.587 --> 1:15:10.374
into the hands
of a person like you.

1:15:10.548 --> 1:15:11.538
Mmm...
Son.

1:15:12.091 --> 1:15:14.486
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:16.342
Reject his request.

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:19.004
Oh, I ain't requesting nothing.

1:15:19.181 --> 1:15:21.844
Ask who I am.
You're Erik Stevens.

1:15:23.310 --> 1:15:24.676
An American black operative.

1:15:24.854 --> 1:15:26.623
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1:15:26.647 --> 1:15:27.637
That's who you are.

1:15:27.815 --> 1:15:29.351
That's not my name, Princess.

1:15:29.859 --> 1:15:31.100
Ask me, King.

1:15:31.277 --> 1:15:32.438
No.

1:15:33.571 --> 1:15:34.687
Ask me.

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:38.444
Take him away.

1:15:39.910 --> 1:15:40.900
Who are you?

1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:45.364
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:47.536
Son of N'Jobu?

1:15:47.710 --> 1:15:48.729
I found my daddy

1:15:48.753 --> 1:15:49.855
with Panther claws in his chest!

1:15:49.879 --> 1:15:51.962
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1:15:52.131 --> 1:15:53.247
You're lying!

1:15:53.424 --> 1:15:55.381
Lies!
I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1:15:57.678 --> 1:15:58.964
What?

1:16:01.432 --> 1:16:02.593
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1:16:02.892 --> 1:16:04.303
Hey, Auntie.

1:16:07.813 --> 1:16:09.791
I'm exercising my blood right

1:16:09.815 --> 1:16:11.477
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1:16:11.650 --> 1:16:13.232
and Black Panther.

1:16:17.948 --> 1:16:19.314
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1:16:19.492 --> 1:16:21.720
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1:16:21.744 --> 1:16:23.360
he is within his rights.

1:16:23.537 --> 1:16:24.823
He has no rights here!

1:16:24.997 --> 1:16:27.080
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

1:16:27.249 --> 1:16:30.458
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1:16:30.628 --> 1:16:32.870
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1:16:33.047 --> 1:16:35.209
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1:16:39.261 --> 1:16:42.129
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1:16:43.432 --> 1:16:45.890
I accept your challenge.

1:17:04.036 --> 1:17:05.402
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:07.724
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1:17:07.748 --> 1:17:09.489
and gotten it over with.

1:17:15.506 --> 1:17:17.943
The king will now have the strength

1:17:17.967 --> 1:17:20.710
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1:17:52.710 --> 1:17:53.996
Where is Agent Ross?

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:56.913
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1:18:01.385 --> 1:18:03.297
This is your last chance.

1:18:05.306 --> 1:18:07.200
Throw down your weapons,

1:18:07.224 --> 1:18:09.841
and we can handle this
another way.

1:18:17.234 --> 1:18:21.194
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1:18:21.363 --> 1:18:25.073
I trained, I lied, I killed...

1:18:25.242 --> 1:18:26.949
just to get here.

1:18:27.745 --> 1:18:31.329
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1:18:33.209 --> 1:18:34.245
Iraq.

1:18:35.836 --> 1:18:37.772
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1:18:37.796 --> 1:18:38.957
right here on this continent.

1:18:41.675 --> 1:18:43.086
And all this death...

1:18:44.303 --> 1:18:46.670
just so I could kill you.

1:18:54.313 --> 1:18:57.522
Let the challenge begin.

1:19:36.105 --> 1:19:37.095
Yield!

1:19:58.877 --> 1:20:00.209
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1:20:20.607 --> 1:20:21.597
Come on, get up.

1:20:22.943 --> 1:20:23.933
Come here.

1:20:27.656 --> 1:20:28.942
This is for my father.

1:20:30.409 --> 1:20:31.695
Erik!

1:20:32.411 --> 1:20:34.118
Zuri, no.
Stop!

1:20:34.496 --> 1:20:35.703
Zuri!
Zuri, don't!

1:20:35.873 --> 1:20:37.865
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1:20:38.042 --> 1:20:39.249
Not him.

1:20:39.793 --> 1:20:40.954
Take me.

1:20:42.296 --> 1:20:43.878
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

1:20:44.798 --> 1:20:46.443
No!

1:20:46.467 --> 1:20:48.925
No! No!

1:20:50.596 --> 1:20:51.632
Zuri, no!

1:20:52.973 --> 1:20:53.963
No!

1:20:54.350 --> 1:20:57.809
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1:20:58.312 --> 1:21:00.144
No! No!

1:21:03.359 --> 1:21:05.646
Is this your king? Huh?

1:21:07.905 --> 1:21:09.191
Is this your king?

1:21:15.537 --> 1:21:17.098
The Black Panther,

1:21:17.122 --> 1:21:18.909
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1:21:19.083 --> 1:21:20.574
Come on, Brother!

1:21:20.751 --> 1:21:22.037
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1:21:23.545 --> 1:21:25.537
Him?

1:21:26.632 --> 1:21:27.668
He's supposed to protect you?

1:21:40.229 --> 1:21:41.686
No.
No!

1:21:49.196 --> 1:21:51.108
No!

1:21:54.284 --> 1:21:56.697
Nah. I'm your king.

1:21:56.870 --> 1:21:58.532
No! No!
We have to go now!

1:21:58.705 --> 1:22:00.788
Queen Mother, let's go!

1:22:36.618 --> 1:22:38.325
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1:22:38.495 --> 1:22:40.223
Yes.

1:22:40.247 --> 1:22:41.613
Thank you.

1:22:41.790 --> 1:22:44.157
We should get
to them immediately.

1:22:44.585 --> 1:22:46.201
I cannot.

1:22:46.378 --> 1:22:46.959
What?

1:22:47.129 --> 1:22:48.540
Though my heart is with you.

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:52.318
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1:22:52.342 --> 1:22:54.112
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1:22:54.136 --> 1:22:55.126
He is of royal blood.

1:22:55.262 --> 1:22:57.549
He killed T'Challa!
In ritual combat.

1:22:57.723 --> 1:22:59.555
Does that really matter?

1:23:02.227 --> 1:23:05.140
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1:23:05.522 --> 1:23:09.311
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:10.601
Overthrow?

1:23:11.528 --> 1:23:12.644
Nakia!

1:23:14.114 --> 1:23:16.857
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1:23:18.619 --> 1:23:23.080
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1:23:23.707 --> 1:23:25.414
What are you loyal to?

1:23:28.879 --> 1:23:30.290
I loved him.

1:23:31.715 --> 1:23:34.002
I loved my country, too.

1:23:34.176 --> 1:23:36.213
Then you serve your country.

1:23:36.386 --> 1:23:39.550
No. I save my country.

1:23:48.607 --> 1:23:49.643
What's wrong?

1:23:49.983 --> 1:23:51.394
The king is dead.

1:23:52.778 --> 1:23:54.690
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1:24:14.675 --> 1:24:16.007
First <i>Baba.</i>

1:24:17.511 --> 1:24:19.093
And now my brother.

1:24:21.932 --> 1:24:24.766
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1:24:32.150 --> 1:24:35.018
It's me.
Nakia. Who is this man?

1:24:35.195 --> 1:24:37.027
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1:24:38.198 --> 1:24:39.300
Where's Okoye?

1:24:39.324 --> 1:24:40.405
Okoye is not coming.

1:24:40.576 --> 1:24:43.319
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1:24:49.251 --> 1:24:50.583
Wait here.

1:24:54.256 --> 1:24:56.964
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1:24:59.344 --> 1:25:01.461
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1:25:01.638 --> 1:25:04.597
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1:25:04.766 --> 1:25:07.554
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1:26:42.739 --> 1:26:45.527
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1:26:45.909 --> 1:26:46.899
Hmm?

1:26:52.833 --> 1:26:55.120
What did you find?

1:26:56.044 --> 1:26:57.455
Your home.

1:26:59.798 --> 1:27:02.791
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.906
Yes. The sunsets there

1:27:06.930 --> 1:27:08.717
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1:27:11.059 --> 1:27:13.142
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1:27:15.897 --> 1:27:16.887
Why?

1:27:19.067 --> 1:27:20.729
They will say you are lost.

1:27:21.319 --> 1:27:22.981
But I'm right here.

1:27:26.908 --> 1:27:29.742
No tears for me?

1:27:33.665 --> 1:27:35.281
Everybody dies.

1:27:37.335 --> 1:27:39.076
It's just life around here.

1:27:43.508 --> 1:27:45.374
Well, look at what I have done.

1:27:46.970 --> 1:27:49.462
I should've taken you back
long ago.

1:27:52.309 --> 1:27:54.722
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1:27:59.858 --> 1:28:02.441
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1:28:04.446 --> 1:28:06.859
That's why they can't find us.

1:28:13.872 --> 1:28:16.285
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

1:28:16.458 --> 1:28:18.825
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1:28:35.644 --> 1:28:37.431
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

1:28:40.482 --> 1:28:41.518
This all of it?

1:28:41.691 --> 1:28:43.628
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1:28:43.652 --> 1:28:44.768
we will be ready.

1:28:45.445 --> 1:28:46.686
Another king?

1:28:48.824 --> 1:28:50.941
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1:28:51.117 --> 1:28:53.700
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1:28:57.374 --> 1:29:00.333
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1:29:04.256 --> 1:29:05.792
Burn it all!

1:29:54.931 --> 1:29:56.422
You know, where I'm from...

1:29:57.392 --> 1:29:59.579
when black folks
started revolutions,

1:29:59.603 --> 1:30:01.344
they never had the firepower...

1:30:01.521 --> 1:30:03.604
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1:30:04.232 --> 1:30:05.848
Where was Wakanda?

1:30:08.445 --> 1:30:09.435
Hmm?

1:30:11.990 --> 1:30:13.697
Yeah, all that ends today.

1:30:13.867 --> 1:30:16.985
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1:30:17.162 --> 1:30:18.869
Already in place.

1:30:19.039 --> 1:30:20.371
I know how colonizers think.

1:30:20.540 --> 1:30:23.078
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1:30:24.085 --> 1:30:26.953
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1:30:27.130 --> 1:30:29.838
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1:30:30.008 --> 1:30:32.421
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1:30:32.594 --> 1:30:34.322
And their children.

1:30:34.346 --> 1:30:36.087
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1:30:36.264 --> 1:30:38.722
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1:30:38.892 --> 1:30:40.508
We're warriors!

1:30:40.685 --> 1:30:43.849
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1:30:45.398 --> 1:30:48.766
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1:30:49.527 --> 1:30:52.190
Wakanda has survived for so long...

1:30:52.364 --> 1:30:55.653
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1:30:55.825 --> 1:30:58.442
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1:30:59.996 --> 1:31:02.204
But the world is changing,
General.

1:31:02.958 --> 1:31:06.372
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1:31:06.544 --> 1:31:08.410
The outside world
is catching up...

1:31:08.588 --> 1:31:10.650
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1:31:10.674 --> 1:31:12.757
or the conquered.

1:31:14.719 --> 1:31:16.381
I'd rather be the former.

1:31:18.556 --> 1:31:21.173
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1:31:22.936 --> 1:31:24.143
<i>So where are we going again?</i>

1:31:24.312 --> 1:31:25.998
<i>We're taking the Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

1:31:26.022 --> 1:31:27.012
<i>to Jabariland.</i>

1:31:27.190 --> 1:31:28.806
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1:31:28.984 --> 1:31:31.397
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1:31:31.569 --> 1:31:34.152
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1:31:34.698 --> 1:31:35.734
Nakia.

1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:41.986
I don't like this.

1:31:42.163 --> 1:31:43.904
The Herb belongs to us.

1:31:44.082 --> 1:31:47.291
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1:31:53.383 --> 1:31:57.127
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1:31:57.721 --> 1:32:01.089
I am a spy with no army.

1:32:02.475 --> 1:32:04.286
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1:32:06.021 --> 1:32:07.512
We'll go.

1:32:14.154 --> 1:32:15.506
Oh, boy.

1:32:20.744 --> 1:32:22.076
Oh, shit.

1:32:23.204 --> 1:32:25.070
Look down. Stay calm.

1:32:25.248 --> 1:32:26.238
Shuri.

1:32:27.542 --> 1:32:28.953
Look down.

1:33:04.287 --> 1:33:05.573
My son...

1:33:07.582 --> 1:33:10.245
was murdered in ritual combat.

1:33:10.710 --> 1:33:12.872
Were the odds fair?
Yes, but...

1:33:13.046 --> 1:33:14.628
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1:33:14.798 --> 1:33:16.664
Do not rub our noses in it!
Silence!

1:33:17.842 --> 1:33:20.425
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1:33:20.595 --> 1:33:23.324
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1:33:25.266 --> 1:33:27.223
The new king...

1:33:35.068 --> 1:33:37.276
You cannot talk!

1:33:37.445 --> 1:33:38.881
One more word,

1:33:38.905 --> 1:33:41.147
and I will feed you
to my children.

1:33:45.328 --> 1:33:47.536
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1:33:54.838 --> 1:33:58.047
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1:34:00.552 --> 1:34:03.841
this is why we are here.

1:34:04.639 --> 1:34:06.801
To offer this to you.

1:34:07.559 --> 1:34:09.926
An outsider sits on our throne.

1:34:10.103 --> 1:34:11.935
Only you can help us stop him.

1:34:29.539 --> 1:34:30.825
Come with me.

1:34:47.182 --> 1:34:49.219
Impossible!

1:34:55.106 --> 1:34:56.142
Is he breathing?

1:34:56.316 --> 1:34:59.059
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1:34:59.444 --> 1:35:01.172
<i>One of our fishermen found him</i>

1:35:01.196 --> 1:35:02.812
<i>at the edge of the river border.</i>

1:35:02.989 --> 1:35:04.275
<i>He brought him to me.</i>

1:35:04.449 --> 1:35:06.190
Why do you have him in the snow?

1:35:06.367 --> 1:35:07.595
It is the only thing keeping him

1:35:07.619 --> 1:35:08.655
from joining the ancestors.

1:35:08.828 --> 1:35:11.366
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1:35:11.539 --> 1:35:13.075
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1:35:14.792 --> 1:35:16.408
Nakia, the Herb.

1:35:33.311 --> 1:35:35.268
I call upon the ancestors.

1:35:35.730 --> 1:35:37.687
I call upon Bast.

1:35:38.191 --> 1:35:41.150
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1:35:42.195 --> 1:35:43.652
Heal him.

1:35:55.583 --> 1:35:58.542
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1:35:58.711 --> 1:35:59.952
Okay.

1:36:12.058 --> 1:36:13.390
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:13.559 --> 1:36:14.549
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:15.687 --> 1:36:17.144
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:18.189 --> 1:36:19.600
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:22.107
Wake up, T'Challa.

1:36:23.361 --> 1:36:24.693
<i>Wake up.</i>

1:36:27.198 --> 1:36:28.530
My son.

1:36:34.956 --> 1:36:37.824
The time has come
for you to come home...

1:36:38.001 --> 1:36:40.414
and be reunited with me.

1:36:51.389 --> 1:36:52.800
Why?

1:36:54.934 --> 1:36:58.018
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1:36:59.772 --> 1:37:01.263
Why, <i>Baba?</i>

1:37:03.109 --> 1:37:04.316
He...

1:37:05.278 --> 1:37:08.567
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1:37:09.699 --> 1:37:12.316
You were wrong to abandon him.

1:37:12.493 --> 1:37:14.359
I chose my people.

1:37:15.204 --> 1:37:17.742
I chose Wakanda.

1:37:17.915 --> 1:37:19.781
Our future depended...

1:37:19.959 --> 1:37:21.495
You were wrong!

1:37:21.669 --> 1:37:23.911
All of you were wrong!

1:37:24.964 --> 1:37:27.877
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1:37:30.219 --> 1:37:32.197
We let the fear of our discovery

1:37:32.221 --> 1:37:34.804
stop us from doing
what is right!

1:37:35.892 --> 1:37:37.224
No more!

1:37:41.022 --> 1:37:44.766
I cannot stay here with you.

1:37:46.569 --> 1:37:50.813
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1:37:51.324 --> 1:37:54.362
He is a monster
of our own making.

1:37:56.037 --> 1:37:59.371
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1:38:01.417 --> 1:38:04.080
I must right these wrongs.

1:38:14.931 --> 1:38:16.593
Do you have a blanket?

1:38:19.394 --> 1:38:21.288
Killmonger has the full support

1:38:21.312 --> 1:38:22.473
of our military.

1:38:24.607 --> 1:38:26.769
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:29.046
Of course he did.

1:38:29.070 --> 1:38:30.857
That's what he was
trained to do.

1:38:31.030 --> 1:38:32.716
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:34.572
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1:38:34.742 --> 1:38:36.825
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1:38:36.994 --> 1:38:39.156
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1:38:39.330 --> 1:38:41.697
You get control of government,
the military...

1:38:41.874 --> 1:38:43.957
Our resources.
Right.

1:38:45.086 --> 1:38:46.076
The Great Mound.

1:38:46.254 --> 1:38:47.916
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1:38:48.089 --> 1:38:50.752
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1:38:54.095 --> 1:38:56.382
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1:38:56.556 --> 1:38:57.546
What?
What about you?

1:38:58.474 --> 1:39:00.431
The challenge
will have to continue.

1:39:00.601 --> 1:39:03.890
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1:39:04.063 --> 1:39:06.055
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1:39:06.232 --> 1:39:08.794
If he gets control
of our technology,

1:39:08.818 --> 1:39:10.150
nowhere will be safe.

1:39:30.798 --> 1:39:32.710
The Black Panther lives.

1:39:33.676 --> 1:39:35.759
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1:39:35.928 --> 1:39:38.466
I will be right there
beside him.

1:39:39.599 --> 1:39:40.806
As will I.

1:39:41.267 --> 1:39:42.508
I'm in, too.

1:39:44.270 --> 1:39:46.353
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1:39:49.650 --> 1:39:51.061
Are you done?

1:39:52.236 --> 1:39:54.273
Are you done?

1:39:55.823 --> 1:39:58.987
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1:40:07.502 --> 1:40:08.618
Thank you.

1:40:09.295 --> 1:40:11.537
I owed you a great debt.

1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:13.922
A life for a life.

1:40:14.091 --> 1:40:15.627
Consider it paid.

1:40:16.302 --> 1:40:18.510
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1:40:19.305 --> 1:40:22.218
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1:40:23.392 --> 1:40:26.055
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1:40:26.229 --> 1:40:28.916
I bet you could.

1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:30.181
But no.

1:40:31.859 --> 1:40:34.476
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1:40:34.654 --> 1:40:36.316
It is our cause.

1:40:36.781 --> 1:40:39.239
It is for all of us.
Oh, us?

1:40:39.408 --> 1:40:41.650
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1:40:41.827 --> 1:40:45.787
and now you speak of "us"?

1:40:47.083 --> 1:40:49.746
I cannot speak for past kings.

1:40:50.378 --> 1:40:53.246
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1:40:53.422 --> 1:40:56.290
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1:40:56.968 --> 1:40:59.112
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1:40:59.136 --> 1:41:01.093
who do you think
he will come for next?

1:41:07.812 --> 1:41:12.102
We will not help you.

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:41.881
Everything is on schedule.

1:41:42.054 --> 1:41:43.215
Have the spies been alerted?

1:41:43.389 --> 1:41:45.506
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1:41:45.891 --> 1:41:47.452
But the War Dogs in London,

1:41:47.476 --> 1:41:49.263
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1:41:50.938 --> 1:41:52.554
We'll strike there first.

1:41:52.732 --> 1:41:54.519
The others'll come around.

1:41:54.692 --> 1:41:56.058
Look at this.

1:41:56.235 --> 1:41:57.379
A handheld sonic cannon,

1:41:57.403 --> 1:41:58.769
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1:41:58.946 --> 1:42:00.562
untraceable by metal detectors.

1:42:00.740 --> 1:42:02.777
And we got thousands of them.

1:42:04.952 --> 1:42:08.070
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1:42:39.612 --> 1:42:40.819
He lives.

1:42:44.867 --> 1:42:46.779
N'Jadaka!

1:42:47.995 --> 1:42:49.236
Wassup?

1:42:49.413 --> 1:42:51.154
I never yielded!

1:42:51.916 --> 1:42:55.626
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1:42:56.170 --> 1:42:58.315
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1:42:58.339 --> 1:42:59.455
I'm the king now!

1:42:59.632 --> 1:43:01.840
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1:43:10.309 --> 1:43:11.891
Shuri, now.
<i>Copy that.</i>

1:43:15.272 --> 1:43:17.980
Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

1:43:18.150 --> 1:43:20.608
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1:43:21.737 --> 1:43:24.821
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1:43:28.869 --> 1:43:30.030
What will we do?

1:43:31.455 --> 1:43:32.599
Border Tribe!

1:43:46.595 --> 1:43:47.585
You!

1:43:47.763 --> 1:43:50.096
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1:43:50.266 --> 1:43:52.098
you are not fit to be a king!

1:43:56.480 --> 1:43:57.596
Come on!

1:43:57.773 --> 1:43:58.763
Ayo, the king!

1:44:14.373 --> 1:44:15.409
Shields!

1:44:46.071 --> 1:44:47.061
Ah!

1:44:50.534 --> 1:44:51.866
W'Kabi, stop this!

1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:54.611
Stop this now!

1:44:58.793 --> 1:44:59.783
No!

1:45:28.155 --> 1:45:30.613
Nakia and I will get control
of the <i>Royal Talon</i> with this.

1:45:30.783 --> 1:45:32.240
So what do I do?

1:45:32.409 --> 1:45:33.490
You'll have to fly it.

1:45:34.370 --> 1:45:36.282
What?
You were a great pilot.

1:45:36.455 --> 1:45:38.492
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1:45:38.666 --> 1:45:40.783
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1:45:41.502 --> 1:45:43.164
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

1:45:43.337 --> 1:45:45.124
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1:45:45.297 --> 1:45:48.040
I'm not a Dora.
Just put it on, it's armor!

1:45:49.552 --> 1:45:50.588
Come!

1:45:53.013 --> 1:45:54.174
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1:45:54.348 --> 1:45:55.784
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1:45:55.808 --> 1:45:57.174
We're counting on you.

1:46:09.864 --> 1:46:11.299
Wakanda forever.

1:46:19.456 --> 1:46:20.517
Come on!

1:46:30.968 --> 1:46:32.084
Go, go!

1:46:37.975 --> 1:46:40.843
<i>Remote piloting system activated.</i>

1:46:41.896 --> 1:46:42.886
My God.

1:46:43.063 --> 1:46:46.101
<i>I made it American
style for you. Get in.</i>

1:46:46.275 --> 1:46:47.878
All right.

1:46:53.991 --> 1:46:54.981
Yes!

1:46:57.077 --> 1:46:59.785
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1:47:01.790 --> 1:47:02.826
All right, I'm on it.

1:47:19.975 --> 1:47:21.286
Lock!

1:47:22.394 --> 1:47:23.601
Get him down!

1:47:23.812 --> 1:47:25.394
Get the necklace!

1:47:25.856 --> 1:47:27.438
Get the necklace!

1:47:34.114 --> 1:47:36.197
Wakanda forever!

1:47:43.999 --> 1:47:46.241
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1:47:46.418 --> 1:47:47.784
Shoot them down, genius!

1:47:47.962 --> 1:47:48.952
All right.

1:47:50.589 --> 1:47:51.625
Here goes nothing.

1:47:58.889 --> 1:48:00.005
All right, got them.

1:48:04.353 --> 1:48:05.594
Oh, shit.

1:48:06.563 --> 1:48:08.304
Shit, shit, shit.

1:48:28.585 --> 1:48:29.666
Nice!

1:49:04.913 --> 1:49:06.016
Shuri!

1:49:10.252 --> 1:49:11.618
What's up, Princess?

1:49:11.795 --> 1:49:13.878
You'll never be a true king.

1:49:16.842 --> 1:49:17.832
Brother!

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.286
Shuri.

1:49:51.710 --> 1:49:52.700
Brother!

1:49:53.587 --> 1:49:55.249
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1:49:55.422 --> 1:49:57.459
<i>The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!</i>

1:49:57.633 --> 1:49:58.965
You won't have protection!

1:49:59.134 --> 1:50:00.466
Neither will he.

1:50:00.636 --> 1:50:02.072
Okay!

1:50:26.078 --> 1:50:28.320
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1:50:28.497 --> 1:50:29.704
Your reign is over!

1:50:29.873 --> 1:50:31.455
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1:50:31.625 --> 1:50:33.103
You want to see us become

1:50:33.127 --> 1:50:35.039
just like the people
you hate so much.

1:50:35.212 --> 1:50:36.953
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1:50:37.131 --> 1:50:39.544
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1:50:39.716 --> 1:50:40.957
You have become them!

1:50:41.260 --> 1:50:43.627
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1:50:43.804 --> 1:50:45.545
The world took
everything away from me!

1:50:45.722 --> 1:50:47.213
Everything I ever loved!

1:50:47.391 --> 1:50:48.848
But I'mma make sure we're even.

1:50:49.017 --> 1:50:50.203
I'mma track down
anyone who would

1:50:50.227 --> 1:50:51.718
even think
about being loyal to you!

1:50:51.895 --> 1:50:53.289
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1:50:53.313 --> 1:50:54.457
right next to Zuri!

1:50:56.692 --> 1:50:57.978
Nakia!

1:51:01.113 --> 1:51:02.900
Are you all right?
I'm okay. You?

1:51:03.073 --> 1:51:04.814
Yes.
Let's go.

1:51:11.957 --> 1:51:14.244
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1:51:16.670 --> 1:51:17.877
Shit. What the hell was that?

1:51:18.046 --> 1:51:19.440
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1:51:19.464 --> 1:51:20.567
What? Where?

1:51:20.591 --> 1:51:22.503
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1:51:26.555 --> 1:51:29.389
<i>Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!</i>

1:51:29.975 --> 1:51:31.341
How long have I got?

1:51:32.060 --> 1:51:35.098
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

1:51:35.898 --> 1:51:36.934
Put me back in.

1:51:37.107 --> 1:51:38.814
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

1:51:57.711 --> 1:51:59.202
Surrender now!

1:51:59.671 --> 1:52:02.539
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1:52:02.716 --> 1:52:03.832
One!

1:52:03.967 --> 1:52:04.957
Two!

1:52:15.020 --> 1:52:19.334
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1:53:00.357 --> 1:53:02.690
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

1:53:11.576 --> 1:53:13.533
<i>Critical weapons failure.</i>
Shit!

1:53:18.750 --> 1:53:20.436
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1:53:20.460 --> 1:53:21.701
is almost at the border...

1:53:21.878 --> 1:53:23.039
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1:53:23.213 --> 1:53:24.499
Make an X with your arms!

1:53:25.299 --> 1:53:27.507
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

1:53:28.302 --> 1:53:29.509
Now break it!

1:53:38.437 --> 1:53:40.349
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

1:53:40.814 --> 1:53:42.897
<i>four, three...</i>

1:53:43.066 --> 1:53:44.682
<i>two, one.</i>

1:53:45.277 --> 1:53:46.393
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1:53:58.707 --> 1:54:00.039
Yes! We did it!

1:54:00.208 --> 1:54:01.744
<i>Great! Now get out of there!</i>

1:54:12.929 --> 1:54:14.215
Charge!

1:54:34.034 --> 1:54:36.367
Drop your weapon!

1:54:37.913 --> 1:54:40.075
Would you kill me, my love?

1:54:40.248 --> 1:54:41.705
For Wakanda?

1:54:45.003 --> 1:54:46.710
Without question!

1:55:30.715 --> 1:55:32.251
This is it for you, Cousin.

1:55:57.993 --> 1:55:59.529
Hell of a move!

1:56:20.724 --> 1:56:22.368
My pop said Wakanda was

1:56:22.392 --> 1:56:23.974
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1:56:27.689 --> 1:56:30.181
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1:56:31.860 --> 1:56:33.442
You believe that?

1:56:34.321 --> 1:56:35.506
Kid from Oakland,

1:56:35.530 --> 1:56:37.396
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1:57:25.789 --> 1:57:27.701
It's beautiful.

1:57:41.888 --> 1:57:44.301
Maybe we can still heal you.

1:57:46.726 --> 1:57:47.887
Why?

1:57:49.688 --> 1:57:51.896
So you can just lock me up?

1:57:55.151 --> 1:57:56.483
Nah.

1:57:58.697 --> 1:58:00.359
Just bury me in the ocean...

1:58:00.532 --> 1:58:03.070
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1:58:03.910 --> 1:58:07.278
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

1:59:31.831 --> 1:59:32.821
Thank you.

1:59:34.834 --> 1:59:36.416
You saved me.

1:59:37.337 --> 1:59:39.454
You saved my family.

1:59:41.675 --> 1:59:43.086
Our nation.

1:59:43.259 --> 1:59:45.592
There's nothing to thank me for.

1:59:45.762 --> 1:59:47.298
It is our duty to...

1:59:50.934 --> 1:59:53.597
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1:59:54.646 --> 1:59:55.636
I should've...

2:00:02.362 --> 2:00:04.570
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

2:00:08.243 --> 2:00:09.484
Stay.

2:00:11.955 --> 2:00:13.265
I think I know a way

2:00:13.289 --> 2:00:15.531
you can still fulfill
your calling.

2:00:16.710 --> 2:00:18.121
Please stay.

2:00:51.244 --> 2:00:52.985
Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

2:00:53.163 --> 2:00:54.825
Who man is that?
Bucket!

2:00:54.998 --> 2:00:55.988
Easy.

2:00:59.002 --> 2:01:00.396
When you said you would take me

2:01:00.420 --> 2:01:02.332
to California
for the first time...

2:01:02.505 --> 2:01:04.462
I thought you meant Coachella...

2:01:04.632 --> 2:01:06.089
or Disneyland.

2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:08.171
Why here?

2:01:11.306 --> 2:01:14.765
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

2:01:19.981 --> 2:01:21.722
They're tearing it down.

2:01:22.817 --> 2:01:23.807
Good.

2:01:23.985 --> 2:01:25.977
They are not tearing it down.

2:01:27.113 --> 2:01:28.729
I bought this building.

2:01:30.784 --> 2:01:32.696
And that building.

2:01:33.536 --> 2:01:35.277
And that one over there.

2:01:36.498 --> 2:01:37.850
This will be the first

2:01:37.874 --> 2:01:40.207
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

2:01:41.461 --> 2:01:44.124
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

2:01:44.881 --> 2:01:46.192
And you will spearhead

2:01:46.216 --> 2:01:48.378
the science
and information exchange.

2:01:49.093 --> 2:01:51.050
You're kidding.

2:01:51.429 --> 2:01:52.715
Eh?

2:02:01.981 --> 2:02:03.083
Oh...

2:02:03.107 --> 2:02:06.020
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

2:02:06.194 --> 2:02:07.901
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

2:02:08.071 --> 2:02:10.654
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

2:02:13.785 --> 2:02:14.946
What?

2:02:16.788 --> 2:02:17.778
Check it out, bro.

2:02:17.956 --> 2:02:19.322
We can take this back
to the house.

2:02:20.625 --> 2:02:21.769
Pull up to school in this.

2:02:21.793 --> 2:02:23.813
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

2:02:23.837 --> 2:02:24.897
On eBay.

2:02:24.921 --> 2:02:26.002
Everybody get,
like, a million apiece.

2:02:26.172 --> 2:02:27.483
I wouldn't do
that if I were you guys.

2:02:27.507 --> 2:02:28.692
Where you come from?
From Wakanda.

2:02:28.716 --> 2:02:29.902
What is a Wakanda?

2:02:29.926 --> 2:02:30.916
Hey, yo!

2:02:31.636 --> 2:02:32.843
This yours?

2:02:36.641 --> 2:02:37.973
Who...

2:02:38.351 --> 2:02:39.512
Who are you?

2:05:25.518 --> 2:05:27.680
<i>My name is King T'Challa...</i>

2:05:27.854 --> 2:05:29.971
<i>son of King T'Chaka.</i>

2:05:30.148 --> 2:05:34.483
<i>I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.</i>

2:05:34.652 --> 2:05:37.395
<i>And for the first time
in our history...</i>

2:05:37.572 --> 2:05:40.781
<i>we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...</i>

2:05:40.950 --> 2:05:42.816
<i>with the outside world.</i>

2:05:42.994 --> 2:05:46.362
<i>Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.</i>

2:05:46.539 --> 2:05:47.950
<i>We cannot.</i>

2:05:49.083 --> 2:05:50.574
<i>We must not.</i>

2:05:50.918 --> 2:05:53.535
<i>We will work to be an example
of how we...</i>

2:05:53.713 --> 2:05:55.955
<i>as brothers and sisters
on this earth...</i>

2:05:56.132 --> 2:05:58.169
<i>should treat each other.</i>

2:05:58.342 --> 2:06:00.174
<i>Now, more than ever...</i>

2:06:01.429 --> 2:06:05.844
<i>the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.</i>

2:06:06.267 --> 2:06:08.179
<i>We all know the truth.</i>

2:06:08.352 --> 2:06:11.766
<i>More connects us
than separates us.</i>

2:06:11.939 --> 2:06:13.646
<i>But in times of crisis...</i>

2:06:13.816 --> 2:06:16.274
<i>the wise build bridges...</i>

2:06:16.444 --> 2:06:19.232
<i>while the foolish
build barriers.</i>

2:06:19.405 --> 2:06:21.442
<i>We must find a way...</i>

2:06:21.616 --> 2:06:24.233
<i>to look after one another...</i>

2:06:24.410 --> 2:06:29.121
<i>as if we were one, single tribe.</i>

2:06:29.290 --> 2:06:30.747
<i>With all due respect,
King T'Challa...</i>

2:06:30.917 --> 2:06:32.227
<i>what can a nation of farmers</i>

2:06:32.251 --> 2:06:34.117
<i>have to offer
the rest of the world?</i>

2:13:33.714 --> 2:13:35.775
Are you playing around
with that man again?

2:13:35.799 --> 2:13:36.789
No.
You're teasing him again.

2:13:38.219 --> 2:13:40.336
Don't wake him. He must rest.
No, I'm not.

2:13:41.305 --> 2:13:42.671
No, I'm not.

2:13:43.641 --> 2:13:44.848
Thabo, you're doing that.

2:13:45.017 --> 2:13:46.383
He's doing it.
He's lying.

2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:47.971
No, he's resting.

2:13:48.270 --> 2:13:49.477
Go, go!

2:13:49.647 --> 2:13:51.434
White Wolf!

2:13:51.565 --> 2:13:52.601
Stop that!

2:13:52.733 --> 2:13:53.849
White Wolf!

2:13:56.612 --> 2:13:58.228
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

2:13:59.740 --> 2:14:00.730
Bucky.

2:14:02.368 --> 2:14:03.404
How are you feeling?

2:14:04.036 --> 2:14:05.026
Good.

2:14:07.665 --> 2:14:08.808
Thank you.

2:14:08.832 --> 2:14:10.368
Come.

2:14:11.877 --> 2:14:13.743
Much more for you to learn.
