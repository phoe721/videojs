WEBVTT

03:27.374 --> 03:29.377
Come here.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.139
Skinny.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.260
We can cook for you. Pasta.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.391
We'd look after you.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.402
You should give me a discount,
on account of my age.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.709
What's your name?

04:09.833 --> 04:11.085
Paolo.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.633
The street is no place for a boy like you.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.550
Don't make your poor mama worry.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.551
Go home.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.145
I can take care of myself.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.450
Get off!

04:38.570 --> 04:39.992
Hey, get the fuck off me!

04:40.113 --> 04:41.490
Hey! Hey!

04:53.752 --> 04:55.174
Mr. Getty.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.090
Mr. Getty.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.263
Sorry, I should have knocked
before coming in.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.727
To the point, Nancy. The market's open.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.347
He's been kidnapped. Paul.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.520
Little Paul, your grandson, in Rome.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.484
They need to speak with you right now.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.271
The Italian police, the boy's
mother, they're on the phone.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.315
Well, I'm not available.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.408
Excuse me, Mr. Getty?

05:17.526 --> 05:19.028
The door, Nancy.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.243
<i>To be a Getty is an extraordinary thing.</i>

05:25.367 --> 05:27.711
<i>I know that because my grandpa told me so.</i>

05:40.757 --> 05:42.225
What do you want?

05:42.634 --> 05:46.514
<i>You see, my grandpa wasn't just
the richest man in the world.</i>

05:46.638 --> 05:50.313
<i>He was the richest man
in the history of the world.</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:26.432
Welcome.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.447
<i>My grandpa was the one who brought the oil</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:41.864
<i>out of the Saudi desert.</i>

06:42.027 --> 06:43.700
<i>Everybody knew it was there.</i>

06:44.195 --> 06:46.744
<i>They just thought it couldn't be done.</i>

06:46.865 --> 06:49.118
<i>But Grandpa found a way.</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:51.495
<i>He made a deal with the Bedouin tribes.</i>

06:51.620 --> 06:53.122
<i>But there was so much oil,</i>

06:53.246 --> 06:56.091
<i>there was no ship big enough to carry it all.</i>

06:56.291 --> 06:58.168
<i>So, my grandfather invented one.</i>

06:59.502 --> 07:00.799
<i>He called it the supertanker.</i>

07:13.892 --> 07:16.611
It's been reported that you are
the first man in history

07:16.895 --> 07:20.570
with a fortune in excess
of a billion dollars.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.279
I have no idea.

07:22.484 --> 07:26.159
But if you can count your money,
you're not a billionaire.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.828
Yeah.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.083
<i>I'm telling you this so you can understand</i>

07:34.204 --> 07:36.047
<i>the things you're about to see.</i>

07:36.164 --> 07:38.838
<i>And maybe you can forgive us.</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:40.586
<i>It's like we're from another planet</i>

07:40.794 --> 07:43.092
<i>where the force of gravity is so strong</i>

07:43.213 --> 07:45.591
<i>it bends the light.</i>

07:45.715 --> 07:47.843
<i>We look like you.</i>

07:47.968 --> 07:49.345
<i>But we're not like you.</i>

07:50.345 --> 07:52.769
<i>But we were, once.</i>

08:30.051 --> 08:32.054
Okay. Okay.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.143
Okay?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.271
Make yourself comfortable.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.246
Okay, now you can take the bag off.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.449
The bag.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.815
Hey.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.485
We'll make friends.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.487
I'll tell you things about me,

09:30.612 --> 09:33.331
and you tell me things about you.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.953
I don't want to know anything about you.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.172
Smart boy.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.882
We talk about you, then.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.096
Yes?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.143
<i>Signora,</i>

09:55.637 --> 09:57.184
we have your son.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.940
God.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.730
Thank you.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.523
Is he all right?

10:03.353 --> 10:06.573
No, <i>signora,</i>

10:06.689 --> 10:10.785
we are <i>rapitori,</i> kidnappers,

10:10.902 --> 10:13.826
and have him captive.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.582
Is this some kind of joke?

10:19.702 --> 10:21.625
<i>No, no. Is no joke,</i> signora.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.915
<i>He's okay. He's not harmed.</i>

10:24.040 --> 10:26.668
<i>We will send proof in the coming days.</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:30.467
Who are you?

10:30.880 --> 10:34.885
I am Cinquanta.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.511
Paul is safe.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.434
But it will require

10:39.472 --> 10:42.692
<i>$17 million to release him.</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:44.686
<i>Go to the police if you like.</i>

10:44.811 --> 10:46.438
<i>It makes no difference.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:48.031
I don't have any money.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.196
<i>Get it from your father-in-law.</i>

10:50.316 --> 10:52.239
<i>He has all the money in the world.</i>

10:59.576 --> 11:00.794
Okay.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.288
One, two, three.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.168
- Mom!
- Dad! Mom!

11:05.290 --> 11:06.257
Mom, Dad!

11:06.374 --> 11:07.341
- Wake up!
- No. Stop.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.676
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on, Mom!

11:08.793 --> 11:09.760
- Too early.
- Let's go!

11:09.878 --> 11:10.879
We want pancakes.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.131
Back to bed, you little monsters.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.973
Get out of bed!

11:14.090 --> 11:15.342
Okay.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.898
- Aileen, you want juice?
- What?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.608
There.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.234
Okay. I have work to do this morning.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.611
You'll have to amuse yourselves quietly.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.329
And then we're going Christmas shopping.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.664
- Mark, stop playing with it.
- Love you.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.202
- Yup.
- If it's too hot, just blow on it.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.792
Here you go.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.124
Morning, Dad!

11:43.536 --> 11:45.129
Hair of the dog might help.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.417
"Hair of the dog"?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.544
What's that, Dad?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.589
Hey, Mom, where to next?

11:54.714 --> 11:55.932
Dad's Christmas present.

11:56.925 --> 11:57.892
Macy's.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.556
Scarf, hat, hair tonic.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.725
Must be 80 stories at least.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.186
How many stories is it, Mom?

12:04.307 --> 12:05.604
I don't know, darling.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.944
It's an awful lot of stories.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.030
Whose is it?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.399
Your grandfather's.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.243
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- No!

12:15.360 --> 12:17.658
Yes!

12:17.779 --> 12:20.077
- We're still gonna beat you.
- But he's your dad.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.496
I've hardly ever met the guy.

12:22.617 --> 12:23.914
How is that possible?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.916
- As a kid, at least.
- My father had

12:26.162 --> 12:27.505
no interest in me whatsoever.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.045
No visits at Christmas,
no birthday phone calls.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.513
Why don't you write him a letter?

12:36.881 --> 12:39.225
Tell him you've been looking for a job.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.978
I don't want to be an oilman. What?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.060
Well, I don't want you
to be one, either, but...

12:45.181 --> 12:47.149
You were never gonna be poor,
Gail, I know that.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.980
We're not poor. We're broke.
There's a difference.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.905
<i>Dear Dad.</i>

12:57.068 --> 12:58.820
"Father."

12:59.112 --> 13:01.285
Dear Father.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.251
For years, I struggled to understand

13:04.367 --> 13:06.290
why you kept your distance.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.465
Now I realize that you were giving me

13:11.582 --> 13:14.085
the chance to prove myself

13:14.210 --> 13:18.306
away from the shadow
of your immense achievements.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.141
Is this how rich people talk?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.802
Yes, like in Henry James.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.348
Fine, do it your way.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.354
But be sincere.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.144
You don't want that.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.438
Hey, turn off the television.
It's time for dinner.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.314
Come on.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.699
Come on!

13:42.071 --> 13:43.368
- Hi, darling.
- Go back through there.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.038
Your mom and I will carry it through
when it's ready, all right?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.251
- Go take a seat.
- Go sit down.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.416
- It's almost ready.
- Go take your seats.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.049
God, your hands are cold.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.380
Stop.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.554
I'm serious. The kids are...

14:05.553 --> 14:07.180
Shit.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.852
That'll be Ms. Canzanelli again,

14:08.973 --> 14:10.316
telling us she's calling the police.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.231
Who sends telegrams anymore?

14:18.816 --> 14:20.659
My God. Somebody died.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.823
No, baby. We've been sent for.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.792
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.047
Dad, is that just for us?

14:46.094 --> 14:48.518
Look at that.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.106
Mom, wake up.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.691
Mom, look at that.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.186
Dad, wake up. It's the Colosseum!

14:54.310 --> 14:55.482
Mom!

14:55.603 --> 14:56.900
Mom, it's the Colosseum.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.566
- Dad.
- Dad?

14:59.690 --> 15:01.488
- Please wake up.
- All right, all right.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.498
Thank you, sir.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.420
Welcome.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.347
- Come, darling. It's okay.
- Aileen, this is amazing.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.014
Mama loves you. It's okay.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.514
It's a lot bigger than our house.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.353
- Mr. Getty.
- Oh, darling.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.147
Mr. Getty, your visitors are here.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.362
Could you take the young ones?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.277
Darling. Don't touch that. Don't touch that.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.650
Please, please. It's very old.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.617
It's possibly priceless. Put it down.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.112
"Priceless"? I deplore that word.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.493
Sorry?

15:55.413 --> 15:57.416
"Dirty and old" I have no problem with.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.135
In fact, I have an affection for them,

16:01.252 --> 16:05.382
as they are the words most
frequently used to describe me.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.348
Along with "rich," of course.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.891
But "priceless," that's
something else altogether, yeah.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.601
People say "priceless"
when what they really mean

16:16.726 --> 16:18.979
is that something is invaluable.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.983
That Minotaur that
you're holding, for instance.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.200
Some experts have told me that this dates

16:27.403 --> 16:30.157
from 460 BC.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.202
I'm sure those fuckers at the Met

16:34.368 --> 16:36.041
- would kill to get...
- Mom, he just said...

16:36.204 --> 16:38.548
...their greasy paws on it.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.671
Go, go.

16:42.293 --> 16:46.514
Would you care to guess
how much I paid for it?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.261
I couldn't possibly.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.219
$11.23.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.640
I picked it up at the black market
in Heraklion.

16:55.139 --> 16:59.485
Some old cripple wanted to ask $19 for it.

16:59.602 --> 17:03.948
It took me one hour to bring
him down to his bottom line.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.236
Yes, today, at auction,

17:07.360 --> 17:11.786
I hazard it could bring $1.2 million.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.458
You see?

17:14.575 --> 17:16.168
Everything has a price.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.497
The great struggle in life

17:18.704 --> 17:22.800
is coming to grips with what that price is.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.840
I want you to have it.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.681
We couldn't.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.050
You like it, Paul?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.596
That's okay. I don't need it.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.017
No, I insist.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.274
It's far too extravagant for a little boy.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.144
Well, for some little boys, it might be.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.487
Not for a Getty.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.115
"Thank you."

17:51.153 --> 17:52.200
Thank you.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.995
Thanks are for strangers.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.743
You're family. My family.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.085
Come on.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.624
Come here, come here.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.588
Let me look at you.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.755
Son.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.045
My son.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.631
My grandson. My daughter.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.224
Well, daughter-in-law, I'm afraid.

18:12.425 --> 18:16.055
No, you're not some district
judge's daughter anymore.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.181
You're one of us now.

18:20.641 --> 18:25.067
I had to focus on my mission, you understand?

18:25.187 --> 18:27.110
On my business. And...

18:27.315 --> 18:31.240
I couldn't be weighed down
mentally with a family.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.620
You understand that, don't you, Paul?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.086
Pardon the laundry.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.585
I just see no point in paying $10

18:43.706 --> 18:47.210
for room service to come up
and launder my undershorts

18:47.335 --> 18:51.215
when I could do the same thing
for just a few lira.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.925
And it's tax deductible.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.724
Almost everything is
if you know how to play it.

18:58.429 --> 19:02.650
What the hell are we doing
standing in a hotel room?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.402
We should be celebrating.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.522
That's what families do.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.774
Right?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.068
"Dear Mr. Getty,

19:12.193 --> 19:14.947
"I'm writing to you because
we're in desperate straits.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.621
"My husband suffers
from a tumor that has caused

19:18.741 --> 19:22.541
"his groin area to swell
to uncontrollable dimensions.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.585
"The doctors say, without immediate surgery,

19:24.789 --> 19:26.792
"normal movement will soon become impossible.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.547
"God bless you. You are a great American.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.967
"Elvira Broadus, Mound City, Arkansas."

19:33.172 --> 19:34.719
Dear Mrs. Broadus,

19:35.132 --> 19:38.102
if I were to respond

19:38.386 --> 19:41.890
to every request for money I receive,

19:43.140 --> 19:47.361
I would soon be as destitute as yourself.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.230
Now...

19:49.355 --> 19:51.358
Next.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.579
"Dear Mr. Getty..."

19:57.697 --> 19:59.825
Surely you can find someone
else to answer your mail.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.327
- I like it, Dad.
- He likes it, son.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.078
The boy wants to be useful.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.922
I find that admirable.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.507
It's a family business.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.631
Everyone has a role to play.

20:10.751 --> 20:14.802
Which reminds me, I'm firing Howard Larkin.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.393
And I'm making you executive
vice president of Getty Oil

20:19.635 --> 20:22.855
in charge of European operations.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.603
What?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.649
All I know about oil is regular or premium.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.239
You wanted a job. I'm giving it to you.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.527
Sink or swim.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.404
Yours, J.P. Getty.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.615
Next.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.711
You're a Getty, Paul.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.755
A Getty is special.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.551
A Getty is nobody's fool.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.969
I want to show you something.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.009
What is it?

21:00.134 --> 21:01.636
It's home.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.686
This is where I slept with my wife, Sabina.

21:05.931 --> 21:10.312
This is where I ate roast
wild boar with my generals.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.824
And this is where I made love
to my concubines.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.030
You used to live here?

21:17.151 --> 21:19.779
Yes, in the second century,

21:21.822 --> 21:23.916
when I was the Emperor Hadrian.

21:28.162 --> 21:33.669
I knew it the very first moment
I visited this place.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.263
I remember every stone

21:37.379 --> 21:41.225
as clearly as if I'd just come from the store

21:41.425 --> 21:43.473
with a packet of smokes.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.186
I have never felt at home anywhere on Earth

21:48.307 --> 21:50.310
till I came here.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.066
Well, maybe they'd let you stay.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.064
Overnight, like. Get a tent.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.033
Sleeping bag.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.652
I've tried.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.745
I've tried, believe me.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.911
I made them an offer, a very generous offer.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.451
"Them"?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.585
Them. The Romans.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.871
But then they hear the name Getty,

22:10.996 --> 22:14.751
and they all get dollar signs
in their eyes, you know.

22:16.544 --> 22:19.263
Yeah, they said it wasn't for sale.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.265
- Figures.
- Exactly.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.051
That old tactic.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.141
That's what I'm talking about, Paul.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.316
The blood of emperors runs through you

22:34.520 --> 22:36.693
as it does through me.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.280
You're a Getty, Paul.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.952
You have a destiny.

22:42.945 --> 22:46.415
<i>My grandfather wanted our family
to become a dynasty.</i>

22:46.532 --> 22:49.081
<i>But Dad could never control his drinking.</i>

22:49.243 --> 22:51.792
<i>And the first time he tried drugs at a party,</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:53.289
<i>he was lost.</i>

23:26.280 --> 23:27.748
Dad?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.133
Dad?

23:53.724 --> 23:56.352
Dad?

24:17.247 --> 24:19.420
Mrs. Getty, they're ready for you now.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.602
Of course, we expect Ms. Getty

24:37.810 --> 24:40.108
will be seeking a generous
financial settlement,

24:40.229 --> 24:43.779
as is typical in high-profile divorce cases.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.277
And there's the custody of the children.

24:46.527 --> 24:50.282
The father is a drug addict
who cannot tie his own shoes.

24:50.781 --> 24:54.001
You would leave the boy alone in Morocco
with a rich degenerate?

24:54.576 --> 24:58.456
The court will take a close interest
in her fitness as a mother.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.924
Ms. Harris suffers

25:01.333 --> 25:04.132
from a common affliction
among the intelligent women,

25:04.670 --> 25:08.800
which is fall in love with <i>imbroglioni.</i>

25:09.133 --> 25:10.555
Losers.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.768
Bums.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.855
Aside from this, she's an excellent mother.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.145
You know this as well as I do.

25:17.558 --> 25:21.483
You are simply stalling,
using the children as a bargaining chip.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.108
We have all the time in the world.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.403
A deal.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.246
I'm sorry, did you say something?

25:31.572 --> 25:33.666
The offer I'm about to make
expires at the end

25:33.782 --> 25:35.159
- of business today.
- Gail, please.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.787
- What is your offer, Ms. Harris?
- Nothing.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.246
You pay nothing.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.965
No alimony, no settlement,

25:42.082 --> 25:44.176
no community property, nothing.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.089
I don't want any money for myself,
just child support for the kids.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.715
I don't get it.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.514
And I want my son on a plane
back from Morocco to me,

25:52.634 --> 25:54.352
tonight, and full custody.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.939
- What's your game?
- I don't want your money.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.353
Everybody wants my money.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.567
You want your money, I want Paul.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.856
We can both have what we want.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.900
I sense I'm being taken.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.775
I... I just don't know how.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.859
Can't help yourself.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.078
You didn't get where you are

26:11.445 --> 26:13.493
without a healthy regard
for the value of a dollar.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.036
You know a bargain when you see one.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.045
You know how to seize the initiative
when your opponent is at his weakest.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.798
What I'm offering you
is the greatest bargain you'll ever get.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.167
But free never lasts.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.968
6:00. Come.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.364
I wanted to stay.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.793
Let's just go home, okay?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.163
I was happy with Dad and Talitha.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.544
Why'd you have to ruin it?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.476
Mr. Getty.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.761
They're here.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.486
I'm sorry, Ms. Getty, Mr. Getty
is unavailable at the moment.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.361
Tell him it's regarding his
grandson's kidnapping in Rome.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.283
I'll wait.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.369
Gail, look at this.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.708
<i>Mr. Getty, we've received reports</i>

27:47.833 --> 27:50.678
<i>that a note has arrived written
in your grandson's handwriting</i>

27:50.794 --> 27:52.671
<i>demanding $17 million US.</i>

27:52.796 --> 27:54.264
<i>$17 million?</i>

27:55.007 --> 27:57.977
<i>That's an awful lot of money
for such a young boy.</i>

27:58.302 --> 28:01.897
<i>Mr. Getty, what steps will you be taking
to secure your grandson's safety?</i>

28:02.264 --> 28:03.356
<i>None.</i>

28:04.975 --> 28:06.648
<i>I'm afraid we didn't get that, sir.</i>

28:06.810 --> 28:08.938
<i>I have 14 grandchildren.</i>

28:09.229 --> 28:11.197
If I start paying ransoms,

28:11.315 --> 28:13.693
I'll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren.

28:13.817 --> 28:17.037
Yeah, you're a famously
ruthless negotiator, Mr. Getty.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.198
Yes, but there's very little in life

28:19.323 --> 28:21.621
worth paying full price for, don't you think?

28:21.742 --> 28:23.369
How much would you pay for your grandson,

28:23.493 --> 28:24.961
if not $17 million?

28:26.622 --> 28:27.714
Nothing.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.003
Ms. Getty, are you still there?

28:33.378 --> 28:35.176
<i>- Ms. Getty...</i>
- Yes, I'm still here.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.392
<i>Would you like me
to give Mr. Getty a message?</i>

28:39.760 --> 28:41.512
Tell him I'm coming.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.233
Mr. Getty.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.826
A message from Mrs. Getty.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.412
Get me Fletcher Chace.

29:09.122 --> 29:13.503
The younger generation
has become weak and lazy.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.677
Our children care about nothing
but Lamborghinis and discotheques.

29:17.923 --> 29:21.143
Well, perhaps, then, you would do well
to accept our competitor's offer.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.895
- How so, Mr. Chace?
- Maybe Standard Oil

29:24.012 --> 29:25.889
will find ways to siphon all that money away

29:26.014 --> 29:27.357
with their accounting tricks

29:27.474 --> 29:30.228
and bring your wayward children
closer to God.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.023
Kidding aside, Your Highness,

29:34.147 --> 29:36.320
my employer has made you rich.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.326
Not as rich as him.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.366
If you renew your
land-use agreement with Getty,

29:40.487 --> 29:41.989
he'll make you twice as rich.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.491
Can Standard Oil say that?

29:44.241 --> 29:46.244
Can Standard Oil say that?

30:04.678 --> 30:06.772
We don't need the Americans anymore.

30:07.681 --> 30:12.187
Our cartel, OPEC, will control inventory now.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.198
OPEC will set the oil price.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.409
Let me just be very clear, okay?

30:19.526 --> 30:22.701
Nothing would make Mr. Getty happier
than to see the price of oil higher.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.074
In fact, he'd be happy to help.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.496
Fletcher!

30:31.621 --> 30:33.339
The old man's on the phone for you!

30:33.457 --> 30:35.460
Gentlemen, excuse me for a moment, please.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.321
Shit.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.539
I'm afraid Mr. Getty is unavailable.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.211
You wouldn't have me thrown out, would you?

31:11.328 --> 31:13.422
I would never turn you away
from my home, ma'am,

31:13.538 --> 31:16.417
or little Paul, but this is not my home.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.044
- To the right, ma'am.
- Thank you.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.986
Sir.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.797
This is new.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.303
How much would you say this painting's worth?

32:03.296 --> 32:05.048
A great deal, I'm sure.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.094
It's awfully small for a Vermeer.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.808
Vermeers are small.

32:11.304 --> 32:14.023
You don't say.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.273
I've learned to appreciate
the finer things from Mr. Getty.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.354
Not in that league.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.235
If I took it off the wall, do
you think anyone would notice?

32:24.359 --> 32:26.612
An alarm would go off. Dogs would get to you

32:26.736 --> 32:28.659
before you made it to the fence.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.491
A face as pretty as that, I wouldn't.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.377
You seem very knowledgeable.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.334
About paintings, no.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.043
About other things, some.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.004
Mr. Chace.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.261
He's a tough old goat
to get an audience with.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.268
Apparently not.

32:55.891 --> 32:56.892
Pull.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.068
And pull.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.539
Great shot.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.873
I think I'm getting better at this.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.079
- Morning, Fletch.
- Morning, Mr. Chace.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.251
Morning.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.668
Help yourself.

33:19.789 --> 33:21.587
- You call.
- Pull.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.632
- Get Mr. Chace a gun.
- Yes, sir.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.263
Morning, sir.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.103
Morning.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.640
Pull.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.278
I need to phone my attorney to find out

33:42.395 --> 33:45.615
if there's been any contact
from the men who took Paul.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.492
Of course, ma'am.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.242
Mr. Getty had it installed
specially for his guests' convenience,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.240
in case they wanted to make telephone calls.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.790
I understand, but Rome is long distance.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.830
I am able to provide change.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.335
Remind me again, Chace,
your family situation.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.590
Well, I was married three times.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.433
First one left me for my brother,

34:12.551 --> 34:15.225
second was a fashion model,

34:15.345 --> 34:17.689
and then the third, I just finalized.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.522
I always say, "You never really know anyone

34:20.642 --> 34:22.565
"until you've been through a divorce."

34:23.270 --> 34:25.113
I wish you would've told
me that three marriages ago.

34:26.439 --> 34:29.484
They say money can't buy love, it turns
out you just have to wait till the end

34:29.609 --> 34:32.658
- for the check to come, right?
- Children?

34:33.154 --> 34:34.406
No, I was never home much.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.329
Yeah, same here.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.994
There was something
my father always used to say,

34:39.953 --> 34:44.174
"A man who has children
gives hostages to fortune."

34:45.041 --> 34:46.634
Well, your father was a wise man.

34:46.751 --> 34:51.223
Yeah. He told me
I would never be worth a damn.

34:51.798 --> 34:54.301
So, I made him look like a pauper.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.599
You certainly did that, sir.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.600
I love my grandson, Chace.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.227
I'm sure you do.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.816
Well, I love all my grandchildren, of course,

35:05.979 --> 35:08.232
but Paul,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.317
Paul is special.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.989
I don't know what I would do
if anything happened to that boy.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.786
Now, I want you to go to Rome.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.543
I want you to bring him back

35:20.660 --> 35:23.379
as quickly and as inexpensively as possible.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.671
I'm gonna need some kind
of resources to work with

35:26.791 --> 35:29.169
- if you want him back alive.
- Well, of course.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.264
I just didn't want you
giving my money away, see?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.634
Now, you find the boy, Chace.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.220
And find out who took him.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.768
And one more thing.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.812
The boy's mother.

35:42.932 --> 35:46.653
A hostage negotiation
is no business for a woman.

35:46.936 --> 35:49.405
So, you take care of her,

35:49.856 --> 35:51.824
but keep her out of the details.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.661
- Understand?
- Yeah, I know how to handle her.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.281
Giovanni, can you hear me?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.409
Can you hear me?

36:00.784 --> 36:02.002
Giovanni?

36:02.452 --> 36:04.796
Giovanni, have I lost you?

36:05.205 --> 36:06.832
- Shit.
- Ma'am?

36:10.877 --> 36:13.301
I apologize for not
introducing myself earlier.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.640
My name is Fletcher Chace.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.760
I'm gonna help you find your son.

36:22.138 --> 36:26.610
I'm sure you're very good
at what you do, Mr. Chace.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.233
My former father-in-law only buys the best.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.357
But I don't need an ex-secret agent

36:31.481 --> 36:33.279
to solve the mystery
of what happened to my son,

36:33.400 --> 36:35.277
because there is no mystery.

36:35.402 --> 36:39.657
I need one thing only,
and that is $17 million.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.834
Paying the ransom doesn't guarantee
you get your son back.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.874
Not paying the ransom
nearly guarantees I don't.

36:44.994 --> 36:48.214
Well, I'd say your son's
chances are better than that.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.380
Why don't you explain the odds to me.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.420
Is it a coin toss?

36:53.753 --> 36:55.881
Heads he lives, tails he dies.
I can see how that's

36:56.005 --> 36:58.759
a chance worth taking when
there's real money at stake.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.385
All right, let me rephrase that, please.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.014
$1 billion earns $17 million a month
sitting in a bank vault.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.642
He could buy a Matisse every
day and never spend it all.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.734
I don't think this is
about money for Mr. Getty.

37:08.977 --> 37:12.447
I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was
your first day on the job.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.570
Look, I've had to bargain
with a lot of people.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.697
Sheikhs, sultans.

37:17.110 --> 37:19.784
The one thing I've learned is
that money is never just money.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.531
All right? It always stands for something.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.579
Usually it stands for the one
thing they've never had.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.293
And until you know what that thing is,

37:25.410 --> 37:27.538
you're just beating your head
against the bricks.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.501
Look, I don't blame you, all right?

37:29.622 --> 37:30.999
You came here for $17 million...

37:31.124 --> 37:32.842
- Nope.
- ...and instead you got me.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.128
I'm the one who has the old man's ear,

37:35.253 --> 37:36.596
and I'm offering to help you.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.974
I'm not leaving here until I speak to him.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.844
- Face-to-face.
- I'm afraid Mr. Getty

37:42.969 --> 37:44.846
has already departed the estate.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.309
He's away on business, and it's
uncertain when he will return.

37:48.558 --> 37:51.186
I'm sure you'll want to be getting
back to Rome on the next flight out.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.483
I'm headed there myself.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.566
I can offer you a ride to the airport.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.331
Out of the way, fellas! Out of the way!

38:11.790 --> 38:13.042
Hey!

38:16.920 --> 38:20.015
- Go ahead.
- My son Paul

38:20.840 --> 38:22.433
must be very frightened right now.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.644
I know I'm frightened for him.

38:25.512 --> 38:28.186
So, to the people who took him,

38:29.557 --> 38:31.275
I don't care why you did this,

38:31.392 --> 38:33.611
but I ask, as a mother, that you

38:33.853 --> 38:36.481
think of your own children or
of the child that you once were

38:36.606 --> 38:38.279
and set my boy free. Thank you.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.610
Your son has disappeared.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.327
A mother should cry for her son.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.697
All right, enough. Let the lady
through. Let's go! Move!

38:47.116 --> 38:48.709
Ms. Getty, I am Magistrate Corvo.

38:48.868 --> 38:49.869
I'm the lead investigator.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.247
- Would you please follow us?
- Come with me. Come.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.132
Ms. Getty, come on, tell us more.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.967
You said you have the money.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.221
You okay?

39:04.342 --> 39:06.345
They want me to cry?

39:06.469 --> 39:07.891
Is that it?

39:29.742 --> 39:32.211
All these letters are addressed to me.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.587
You've been opening my mail?

39:36.708 --> 39:40.679
No, this may be your mail, Ms. Getty,
but it is our evidence.

39:40.795 --> 39:44.049
You see, all these letters,
they come from people

39:44.173 --> 39:46.676
who claim to have kidnapped your son.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.309
They come from all over the world, too.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.934
Germany, California...

39:51.180 --> 39:53.353
Faster than we can investigate.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.106
Well, $17 million sure brings out a crowd.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.030
- You're telling me you have nothing?
- No.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.945
I'm telling you we have too much.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.113
Too many kidnappers, too many reporters.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.238
You want some free advice?
Put it in the papers.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.824
When the kidnappers find out
that every lowlife in Rome

40:08.948 --> 40:12.289
is trying to scoop up their ransom, they'll
have to come out into the open to claim it.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.787
It's the communists.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.710
It's the Red Brigades, the Brigate Rosse.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.254
- Possibly.
- To kidnap

40:18.708 --> 40:21.052
the child of the richest
capitalist in the world,

40:21.169 --> 40:22.546
it's a dream come true for them.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.473
Well, I may be able
to initiate some back channels

40:25.590 --> 40:27.558
- with the Red Brigades.
- Back channels?

40:27.759 --> 40:29.602
Mr. Chace, these are terrorists.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.184
You're not gonna find them
listed in a telephone book.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.353
I still have some contacts in those areas.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.940
I advise you to leave this to us.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.521
For your own safety.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.774
And you, Ms. Getty, they will take you, too,

40:41.898 --> 40:42.899
if they get a chance.

40:43.024 --> 40:45.118
Which is why I put you
under police protection.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.153
You will find my officers in your home.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.655
I don't need anyone's protection.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.000
I'm not a real Getty. I never was.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.004
I'm an ordinary person.

40:57.246 --> 40:59.544
No. You're not a person anymore.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.376
You're a symbol.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.258
I will see you at your apartment.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.083
- Madam.
- Marina.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.053
<i>- Carabinieri</i> are in the kitchen.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

41:53.219 --> 41:56.564
Is there anywhere else you can put that
so we can have a place to cook?

41:56.681 --> 41:57.648
Your child is kidnapped.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.142
How can you think about eating?

41:59.267 --> 42:00.610
Hi there.

42:00.977 --> 42:01.944
Hi.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.155
- I can't sleep.
- Darling. Come.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.449
All these strange men in your house.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.075
Can I sleep in your bed?

42:08.192 --> 42:09.284
Of course you can.

42:28.171 --> 42:33.268
Have you found anything, secret agent man?

42:33.509 --> 42:35.352
Did Paul do any drugs?

42:35.470 --> 42:36.892
Hashish?

42:38.306 --> 42:40.604
He's a teenage boy.

42:40.850 --> 42:43.194
He has teenage boy problems.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.522
Makes teenage boy mistakes.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.694
I'm just trying to find it
before that guy out there does.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.945
He'd gotten into trouble
at school, am I right?

42:51.903 --> 42:53.906
A boy needs a father,

42:54.030 --> 42:56.499
and his was strung out
in Marrakech with Mick Jagger.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.994
It was all I could do to
get him to come home at night.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.418
I better keep this.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.305
You carry a gun, Mr. Chace?

43:14.467 --> 43:16.390
You said you used to be a spy.

43:16.636 --> 43:19.310
Well, it's not how I put it
on my tax returns, but, yeah.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.141
Spies carry guns.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.976
I never bothered.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.104
Ruins the line of your suit.

43:25.228 --> 43:27.071
And guns are for people who don't have money.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.441
All that spooky paperback stuff,

43:29.565 --> 43:31.818
chasing around, blowing
poison darts at the KGB

43:31.943 --> 43:35.322
in the Arab Quarter, it's not
what I did for a living.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.789
What do you do?

43:37.740 --> 43:40.209
I made deals. I bought people.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.421
Keep it.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.382
Forgive me, Ms. Getty.

43:46.499 --> 43:48.923
Just one last question

43:49.210 --> 43:51.429
regarding your testimony earlier.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.803
Why did you think the kidnapping was a joke?

43:55.675 --> 43:57.894
It's a figure of speech.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.812
The whole situation

44:00.054 --> 44:01.556
was unbelievable. It still is.

44:01.931 --> 44:04.730
Well, tragic, yes, but not unbelievable.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.235
It's not tragic yet.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.730
Maybe you ought to work
on keeping it that way.

44:13.234 --> 44:16.454
Okay, write another letter to your mother

44:16.571 --> 44:18.744
and tell her, if she doesn't pay,

44:20.158 --> 44:22.582
we'll mail her your finger.

44:25.246 --> 44:28.250
Why doesn't your family love you?

44:28.374 --> 44:30.593
I think they love me.

44:31.711 --> 44:32.803
I hope so.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.093
What's wrong with you?

44:35.214 --> 44:37.512
Are you a bad boy?

44:38.551 --> 44:40.098
- You a bad boy?
- No.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.222
You're a bad boy.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.983
Don't lie.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.148
What did you do?

44:50.813 --> 44:54.033
I set fire to my school once
and got kicked out.

44:56.527 --> 44:58.495
Well,

44:58.905 --> 45:01.579
boys play with fire.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.827
I did.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.328
You want to try it?

45:11.083 --> 45:13.507
If my son was kidnapped,

45:13.920 --> 45:16.139
bad, good,

45:16.714 --> 45:19.092
I would pay any money to get him back.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.974
I would borrow it. Steal.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.394
Okay, I steal anyway, but I would steal more.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.278
Could I have another light?

45:35.191 --> 45:36.534
Americans.

45:36.859 --> 45:39.362
I don't understand you.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.706
For us, family is everything.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.746
We are <i>obbligati.</i>

45:45.243 --> 45:47.416
I was born into my family,

45:47.536 --> 45:49.413
and that decides my whole life.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.915
My whole life.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.423
I'm <i>obbligato,</i> too.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.715
As much as you.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.187
What are you doing? Write!

46:09.392 --> 46:11.645
Convince her to pay us our money,

46:11.894 --> 46:14.397
or <i>Madonna mia,</i> I...

46:16.399 --> 46:18.117
I'll kill you myself.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.165
You saw.

47:16.125 --> 47:17.126
What?

47:17.293 --> 47:19.341
Fuck, you've seen me.

47:26.302 --> 47:29.351
If I tell Piccolino,

47:29.513 --> 47:32.608
he'll have your eyes pulled out

47:33.976 --> 47:36.980
so you can never identify us.

47:41.233 --> 47:45.238
Even blind, your family will pay for you.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.408
You don't have to tell him.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.916
Please.

47:53.037 --> 47:55.381
Look at me. I want to see your eyes.

47:55.498 --> 47:56.966
Look at me, look at me.

48:02.922 --> 48:05.550
I don't tell on you

48:06.258 --> 48:08.727
and you don't tell on me.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.268
Okay.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.217
Look at the...

48:50.094 --> 48:51.892
Fucking communists.

50:16.388 --> 50:17.765
You don't look like communists.

50:18.015 --> 50:21.269
- Let's talk about the money.
- First you prove to me

50:21.393 --> 50:22.815
that you have the boy
and he's in good health,

50:22.937 --> 50:25.190
and then we negotiate the terms.
But first the proof.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.070
First the money, then the boy.

50:27.650 --> 50:29.243
I don't think you have the kid.

50:29.944 --> 50:32.618
Why are we negotiating with him?

50:32.988 --> 50:35.412
We should try him and put him to death.

50:36.075 --> 50:37.543
For what?

50:37.660 --> 50:40.630
For crimes against the proletariat.

50:40.913 --> 50:42.711
Now I know you don't have the kid.

50:44.667 --> 50:46.340
We had an agreement.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.504
With Paul.

50:48.671 --> 50:50.048
Excuse me?

50:53.133 --> 50:56.728
Paul used to talk
about having himself kidnapped.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.810
With friends, out on the street.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.350
A game. No one gets hurt.

51:01.809 --> 51:04.733
A way to make a little money
from his grandfather.

51:04.853 --> 51:06.776
$2 million, perhaps.

51:06.897 --> 51:09.025
That's what we do.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.069
Did Paul know who you were?

51:11.193 --> 51:14.697
Well, we made friends with him,
and we told him we could help.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.081
Then he disappeared.

51:16.198 --> 51:18.041
We believe he found someone else.

51:20.661 --> 51:22.254
And now you want what?

51:22.454 --> 51:24.127
Finder's fee? Consolation prize?

51:24.915 --> 51:27.964
Here I thought you all were
supposed to be above money.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.800
No one is above money.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.762
Problem is that it's in the wrong hands.

51:33.966 --> 51:35.468
We intend to get what's our due.

51:39.763 --> 51:42.141
Did Paul ever talk to you
about having himself kidnapped?

51:50.232 --> 51:53.281
You've got to remember who the Gettys are.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.780
Every time someone stays
in the bathroom for too long,

51:55.904 --> 51:58.407
someone makes a joke
about being held for ransom.

51:58.574 --> 52:01.544
Paul might have cracked a joke
once or twice among friends...

52:03.203 --> 52:05.547
There's that word again.

52:06.248 --> 52:07.249
What word?

52:07.583 --> 52:08.880
A "joke."

52:09.001 --> 52:11.299
You said you thought
it was a joke when it first happened.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.089
Now you sound like that policeman.

52:13.213 --> 52:14.510
Whose side are you on, Mr. Chace?

52:14.882 --> 52:17.556
I'm on my own side. Always.
And if this is a joke,

52:17.676 --> 52:19.474
I'd like to make sure that I'm in on it.

52:32.941 --> 52:34.864
Where's the old man?

52:38.530 --> 52:40.077
Come here!

52:40.282 --> 52:42.501
Hey, good girl. Hey, hey.

52:48.540 --> 52:51.669
I can't say I'm surprised.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.473
Are you all right, Mr. Getty?

53:01.637 --> 53:04.561
When I wrote my book, <i>How to Be Rich,</i>

53:04.682 --> 53:06.730
the publishers wanted to change the title.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.648
They wanted to call it "How to Get Rich."

53:08.769 --> 53:11.944
Well, I told them, "Getting rich is easy."

53:12.106 --> 53:14.655
I mean, any fool can get rich.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.073
And any number of fools do.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.446
I've noticed that.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.499
But being rich,

53:23.659 --> 53:25.582
that's something else.

53:25.953 --> 53:28.206
When a man becomes wealthy,

53:28.831 --> 53:32.051
he has to deal with the problems of freedom.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.805
All the choices he could possibly want.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.799
An abyss opens up.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.594
Well, I've watched that abyss.

53:42.469 --> 53:46.850
I've watched it ruin men, marriages.

53:46.974 --> 53:49.068
But most of all,

53:49.393 --> 53:51.691
it ruins the children.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.241
I thought I could trust my own blood.

53:57.067 --> 53:58.785
He's a kid.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.617
Kids do stupid things.

54:01.363 --> 54:02.581
He's probably lying on a beach somewhere,

54:02.698 --> 54:03.870
and when he gets bored or runs out of money,

54:03.991 --> 54:05.834
he'll come home and he'll
have learned his lesson.

54:06.201 --> 54:07.703
You know, if he hadn't,
I could always teach him one,

54:07.828 --> 54:09.922
if need be, at your discretion, of course.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.999
I wanted to give him everything,

54:12.124 --> 54:14.092
everything I've learned, all of

54:14.543 --> 54:17.262
my knowledge, all that I've built.

54:17.379 --> 54:19.006
And he just wanted to

54:19.256 --> 54:21.259
pick my pocket like his father,

54:21.383 --> 54:25.058
like all the parasites

54:25.387 --> 54:27.811
that have swarmed around me all my life.

54:30.559 --> 54:33.313
That's why I like things.

54:33.645 --> 54:34.942
You see?

54:35.272 --> 54:39.448
Things, objects, artifacts, paintings, and...

54:40.944 --> 54:44.665
They are exactly what they appear to be.

54:44.865 --> 54:46.333
They never change.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.123
They never disappoint.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.873
There's a purity to beautiful things

54:52.998 --> 54:57.094
that I've never been able
to find in another human being.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.596
Neither have I.

55:00.339 --> 55:01.807
Look, Mr. Getty,

55:02.299 --> 55:03.676
you were right not to pay the ransom.

55:03.801 --> 55:05.394
You were right to follow your gut.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.774
You performed well.

55:11.183 --> 55:13.686
It will be reflected in your year-end bonus.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.816
Well, thank you, sir.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.325
Go back to Rome.

55:20.859 --> 55:22.987
Wait for Paul to return.

56:43.275 --> 56:44.743
Hurry up.

56:55.871 --> 56:57.748
Okay, I'm all done.

57:04.338 --> 57:06.807
What the fuck are you looking at?

57:09.176 --> 57:10.348
Fuck.

57:14.222 --> 57:15.895
You saw my face.

57:16.016 --> 57:18.269
I didn't see anything.

57:18.477 --> 57:20.946
You saw my face! Don't lie!

57:21.063 --> 57:22.940
Look, man, I won't tell anybody, I swear.

57:25.859 --> 57:27.532
You can trust me.

57:31.031 --> 57:33.034
- He saw my face.
- Look, I won't tell anybody, okay?

57:33.784 --> 57:35.502
Look, you guys can still get your money.

57:35.744 --> 57:37.542
Please, please, please. No, no, no, no, no.

57:37.663 --> 57:40.087
No, no, no, I won't tell anybody! Please!

57:53.929 --> 57:55.021
This is Chace.

57:55.138 --> 57:58.267
<i>Mr. Chace, it's Corvo.</i>

57:58.392 --> 58:01.896
<i>I've just sent a car
to pick up you and Ms. Getty.</i>

58:02.187 --> 58:03.405
For what?

58:03.522 --> 58:05.695
<i>To come and identify the body.</i>

58:05.941 --> 58:07.409
- The body?
<i>- It's Paul.</i>

58:07.734 --> 58:09.862
It's Paul Getty's body.

58:10.612 --> 58:12.330
I am sorry.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.457
Paul?

58:14.908 --> 58:16.501
<i>Yes, it's the kid.</i>

58:17.369 --> 58:19.246
Look, mistakes were made, obviously.

58:19.371 --> 58:20.498
Somehow, I...

58:20.622 --> 58:23.421
I'm on my way to identify my son's body.

58:23.542 --> 58:25.385
I don't feel like talking.

58:26.128 --> 58:27.505
- Gail...
- I've got nothing to say to you!

58:27.629 --> 58:31.058
Gail, my investigation and the police's
led us to the conclusion that

58:31.174 --> 58:32.471
- there was no physical danger.
- You bastards!

58:32.634 --> 58:34.762
You did nothing! All of you!

58:35.303 --> 58:39.562
You couldn't find Paul, so you came up
with a story to cover your tracks.

58:39.683 --> 58:41.310
You made Paul into the criminal. You gave up.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.733
Whatever the old man is,
you're worse. You're lazy!

58:43.854 --> 58:46.198
Lazy? No. No.

58:46.314 --> 58:47.566
Stupid? Maybe.

58:47.691 --> 58:48.783
Lazy? I...

58:49.234 --> 58:51.908
No one did enough. No one.

58:52.070 --> 58:54.289
None of us cared enough.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.253
I must warn you

59:03.373 --> 59:05.216
the corpse has been

59:05.333 --> 59:06.505
burned

59:06.626 --> 59:08.253
and disposed of in seawater

59:08.378 --> 59:11.132
to make identification more difficult.

59:12.758 --> 59:14.761
Show me.

59:33.195 --> 59:34.993
It's very sticky.

59:35.113 --> 59:36.865
Would you like to help me, please?

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:02.228
It's not him. It's not Paul.

1:00:04.935 --> 1:00:07.029
Course it's not him. It's a grown man.

1:00:07.270 --> 1:00:08.488
How could you not see that?

1:00:08.605 --> 1:00:11.654
That guy was headed for a midlife crisis
when they shot him.

1:00:12.025 --> 1:00:14.870
A sailor saw that body
get thrown out of the same VW van

1:00:14.986 --> 1:00:16.954
that was in the vicinity
when they took the boy.

1:00:20.033 --> 1:00:21.000
Step outside, please.

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:22.119
Thank you.

1:00:24.371 --> 1:00:25.589
Come on.

1:00:26.206 --> 1:00:28.459
Come on. Come on.

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:38.765
The body belongs
to Ettore "Il Tamia" Pazzano.

1:00:38.927 --> 1:00:39.928
Age 33.

1:00:40.762 --> 1:00:44.062
Purse-snatching, vandalism, public indecency.

1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:47.649
Known associates,

1:00:47.853 --> 1:00:49.480
Alberto Laganadi.

1:00:51.606 --> 1:00:52.983
Dino Bova.

1:00:53.525 --> 1:00:55.698
And Dante Agnana.

1:00:55.819 --> 1:00:57.412
Alias, Cinquanta.

1:00:58.822 --> 1:01:01.041
All from Fiumara, Calabria.

1:01:03.410 --> 1:01:06.129
- How fast can we get to Fiumara?
- Six hours.

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:21.829
You got way too many men out here.

1:02:22.030 --> 1:02:23.407
All right, we're not
invading another country.

1:02:23.615 --> 1:02:24.582
Just tell them to lay low.

1:02:24.699 --> 1:02:26.622
We wait all night if we have to.

1:02:26.826 --> 1:02:30.164
One of your guys gets trigger-happy,
that boy could get caught in the crossfire.

1:02:30.288 --> 1:02:32.336
Don't look at me like that. It happens.

1:02:36.211 --> 1:02:38.054
What the fuck is he looking at?

1:04:12.432 --> 1:04:14.059
Francesca! Francesca!

1:04:14.267 --> 1:04:15.985
Francesca!

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:40.335
They haven't found anyone.

1:04:59.479 --> 1:05:01.026
Paul.

1:05:24.796 --> 1:05:25.923
Paul.

1:05:32.220 --> 1:05:33.813
We got a live one.

1:05:51.072 --> 1:05:52.949
They sold him.

1:05:59.372 --> 1:06:01.170
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:08:30.690 --> 1:08:33.193
- Sir, do you have a newspaper?
- Here.

1:08:33.318 --> 1:08:34.911
Thank you.

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:38.574
Petrol rationing soon, guv.

1:08:42.827 --> 1:08:43.828
It's a good day.

1:08:44.287 --> 1:08:45.834
I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Getty.

1:08:45.955 --> 1:08:47.628
It'll make this much easier.

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:49.584
We need to pay the ransom.

1:08:49.709 --> 1:08:51.552
I thought you said this was a hoax.

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:54.923
Your grandson was kidnapped
by members of the Calabrese 'Ndrangheta.

1:08:55.048 --> 1:08:57.642
Two of the original kidnappers
are dead, and one is missing.

1:08:58.051 --> 1:08:59.849
That sounds like progress to me.

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:01.187
I'm afraid not, all right?

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:02.931
They got nervous waiting for the ransom.

1:09:03.056 --> 1:09:04.933
They sold the boy to an investor.

1:09:05.141 --> 1:09:06.814
An investor?

1:09:06.934 --> 1:09:08.527
Who invests in kidnapped children?

1:09:08.645 --> 1:09:09.737
You'd be surprised.

1:09:09.854 --> 1:09:11.982
There's nothing people can't find a way
to turn into money.

1:09:12.231 --> 1:09:16.407
You told me that Paul and his mother
had cooked this up to soak me.

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:18.200
And I was wrong, all right?
Paul may have talked

1:09:18.321 --> 1:09:19.789
about being kidnapped with his friends.

1:09:20.031 --> 1:09:22.375
He put it out there. He's not behind this.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:25.085
How do I know that you're not wrong now?

1:09:25.203 --> 1:09:27.831
These people are not
the old-world <i>Malavita</i> anymore.

1:09:27.955 --> 1:09:29.798
Their only code is profit and loss.

1:09:29.916 --> 1:09:31.088
They will do things to Paul

1:09:31.209 --> 1:09:33.462
that cannot be undone
for any amount of money.

1:09:33.586 --> 1:09:36.385
- We have to pay.
- This simply isn't possible.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:39.260
My financial position has changed.

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:42.224
Really? I mean, 30 seconds ago,
you said it was a good day.

1:09:42.345 --> 1:09:44.894
I mean, I'm not all that bright,
but I can multiply as well as you.

1:09:45.390 --> 1:09:48.313
With oil up as much as it was this morning,
you have amassed another fortune.

1:09:48.476 --> 1:09:52.652
Well, what if the embargo is lifted
and oil were to crash?

1:09:52.772 --> 1:09:54.775
I'd be exposed.

1:09:55.149 --> 1:09:58.744
I have never been more vulnerable financially

1:09:58.945 --> 1:10:00.447
- than I am right now.
- Mr. Getty,

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:04.083
with all due respect,
nobody has ever been richer

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.123
than you are at this moment.

1:10:06.244 --> 1:10:09.419
I have no money to spare.

1:10:09.706 --> 1:10:11.253
What would it take?

1:10:11.374 --> 1:10:14.128
I mean, what would it take
for you to feel secure?

1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:16.547
More.

1:10:23.177 --> 1:10:24.975
Where is my son?

1:10:25.471 --> 1:10:27.394
I'm with him.

1:10:27.515 --> 1:10:29.358
He's still in good health. Don't worry.

1:10:29.559 --> 1:10:32.438
It's because of you I worry.

1:10:32.603 --> 1:10:34.321
I want to talk to him.

1:10:35.356 --> 1:10:38.405
I'm afraid this I cannot do.

1:10:38.526 --> 1:10:40.153
I'm not in charge anymore.

1:10:45.074 --> 1:10:47.042
This is Fletcher Chace.

1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:50.005
Mr. Getty's authorized me
to negotiate on his behalf.

1:10:50.204 --> 1:10:52.673
We'll cover all your expenses up to $200,000.

1:10:52.790 --> 1:10:55.043
Anything under this figure
is not considered extortion

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:58.471
under Italian law, so you
can walk away free and clear.

1:10:58.588 --> 1:10:59.806
<i>Come on.</i>

1:11:02.091 --> 1:11:06.597
These people are not stupid, <i>Signor</i> Chace.

1:11:06.721 --> 1:11:08.439
<i>The boy is worth nothing to anybody.</i>

1:11:08.556 --> 1:11:10.354
Okay? We're just trying
to settle this without causing

1:11:10.475 --> 1:11:12.273
any more embarrassment to the family.

1:11:12.477 --> 1:11:14.730
He's a juvenile delinquent, his
grandfather has disowned him.

1:11:14.854 --> 1:11:16.447
It's a tough break. You took the wrong kid,

1:11:16.564 --> 1:11:17.907
but you're getting off easy now.

1:11:18.107 --> 1:11:19.859
You arrogant bastard.

1:11:21.277 --> 1:11:23.280
Your uncle Piccolino died in
custody last night, by the way.

1:11:23.404 --> 1:11:25.327
You better take this deal
before the same happens to you.

1:11:28.201 --> 1:11:30.795
Cinquanta, don't hang up. This is Gail.

1:11:33.456 --> 1:11:35.880
Shit. Shit.

1:11:39.462 --> 1:11:42.432
- Gail...
- You're done. You're fired!

1:11:42.548 --> 1:11:44.471
- I don't work for you, Gail.
- Get out!

1:11:44.592 --> 1:11:46.811
- Look, if you'll let me explain...
- Get out, get out, get out!

1:11:47.261 --> 1:11:49.764
Gail, I lied. All right?

1:11:49.889 --> 1:11:53.143
I said I was authorized to pay them $200,000.

1:11:53.267 --> 1:11:55.895
You know how much I'm really
authorized to pay? Nothing.

1:11:56.145 --> 1:11:59.865
All right, if they accept, I won't be able
to deliver, but I had to buy some time.

1:12:00.441 --> 1:12:02.284
You wanted to know what I used to do.

1:12:02.401 --> 1:12:05.075
This is what I used to do,
what I still do for Getty.

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:07.039
You make deals.

1:12:07.657 --> 1:12:08.954
You buy people.

1:12:09.242 --> 1:12:11.165
That's right. Whether it's
an oil well in the desert

1:12:11.285 --> 1:12:12.832
or a human life, it's all the same.

1:12:12.954 --> 1:12:14.957
We have to show we are willing to walk away.

1:12:15.248 --> 1:12:16.921
I can't walk away. You can walk away,

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:18.839
because you have nothing else in your life.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:21.179
Because there's no one
in your life but yourself.

1:12:21.379 --> 1:12:23.757
Fair enough. $17 million and zero dollars,

1:12:23.881 --> 1:12:25.383
that's how far apart we are.

1:12:25.508 --> 1:12:27.010
Those numbers have got to move.

1:13:01.294 --> 1:13:03.888
$7 million.

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:28.867
Otto.

1:13:34.577 --> 1:13:36.580
Mr. Getty, Mr. Lam.

1:13:38.205 --> 1:13:39.332
Good morning, Mr. Getty.

1:13:39.457 --> 1:13:41.460
Nothing good about it.

1:13:43.336 --> 1:13:45.839
Let's get down to business, shall we?

1:13:45.963 --> 1:13:48.261
Are you serious about making payment?

1:13:48.424 --> 1:13:50.222
I wouldn't be here if I weren't.

1:13:51.052 --> 1:13:53.305
Because there can't be any more games.

1:13:54.013 --> 1:13:55.481
You know our price,

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:58.192
and it's not subject
to negotiation any longer.

1:13:58.726 --> 1:14:01.821
Payment must be made in cash today.

1:14:01.938 --> 1:14:03.736
I want the proof first.

1:14:04.649 --> 1:14:05.696
After you.

1:14:08.027 --> 1:14:09.154
Daniel.

1:14:38.099 --> 1:14:39.851
There you are.

1:14:42.269 --> 1:14:44.738
Beautiful child.

1:14:45.231 --> 1:14:48.201
Because of the painting's
disputed provenance,

1:14:48.651 --> 1:14:51.496
it can never be publicly displayed.

1:14:54.657 --> 1:14:56.000
Careful.

1:15:03.165 --> 1:15:05.168
I'm a bit disappointed.

1:15:05.292 --> 1:15:08.262
It's not in the condition I expected.

1:15:08.546 --> 1:15:13.643
I'm not sure it's worth
the 1.5 million you're asking.

1:15:13.884 --> 1:15:17.639
True masterpieces
rarely go on sale, Mr. Getty.

1:15:18.305 --> 1:15:21.855
If you're not willing to pay,
you will never own one.

1:15:26.188 --> 1:15:27.406
Pay the man.

1:16:21.494 --> 1:16:23.462
Hey, Paolo.

1:16:24.330 --> 1:16:26.298
Paolo. Look.

1:16:26.540 --> 1:16:28.508
I brought you something to warm you.

1:16:31.879 --> 1:16:35.179
Something special for being a good boy.

1:16:37.968 --> 1:16:40.221
Can I just have some crackers instead?

1:16:40.554 --> 1:16:41.806
<i>E che</i> crackers?

1:16:41.931 --> 1:16:43.934
What you want that for?

1:16:44.225 --> 1:16:46.228
I brought you this good <i>bistecca.</i>

1:16:46.393 --> 1:16:47.645
Come on.

1:16:48.312 --> 1:16:49.655
Why?

1:16:50.064 --> 1:16:51.316
You bring me steak now.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:52.942
- Why?
- No questions.

1:16:53.192 --> 1:16:54.364
You need to be strong.

1:16:54.485 --> 1:16:56.408
Hey, <i>forte.</i> Come on.

1:16:56.862 --> 1:16:58.080
Paolo.

1:16:58.197 --> 1:16:59.415
Hey.

1:16:59.532 --> 1:17:00.659
- Smile.
- Okay, okay.

1:17:00.866 --> 1:17:03.415
I'll eat it. Just leave me alone,
and I'll eat it, okay?

1:17:37.486 --> 1:17:38.988
Hey, hey, hey!

1:17:56.881 --> 1:17:59.009
Hey, hey, hey.

1:18:15.733 --> 1:18:17.576
Hey. Hey.

1:18:19.111 --> 1:18:20.954
Hey.

1:18:21.071 --> 1:18:24.746
Hey. Hey.

1:18:55.940 --> 1:18:57.237
Hey.

1:19:03.322 --> 1:19:05.950
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:19:17.211 --> 1:19:19.930
Hey!

1:19:21.382 --> 1:19:23.601
Hey.

1:21:51.865 --> 1:21:53.458
Okay.

1:21:54.952 --> 1:21:56.875
Follow me. Follow me.

1:22:41.790 --> 1:22:44.384
<i>Signora,</i> telephone.

1:22:58.015 --> 1:22:59.733
Hello?

1:23:02.144 --> 1:23:03.521
Hello?

1:23:03.645 --> 1:23:05.613
<i>- Mom.</i>
- Paul?

1:23:05.731 --> 1:23:07.233
<i>Mom, is that you?</i>

1:23:10.903 --> 1:23:12.655
Paul?

1:23:12.779 --> 1:23:14.577
<i>It's okay. I'm safe now.</i>

1:23:14.698 --> 1:23:16.325
<i>I'm at the police station.</i>

1:23:16.450 --> 1:23:17.577
<i>I'm all right.</i>

1:23:17.701 --> 1:23:19.578
<i>But I need you to come and get me.</i>

1:23:19.703 --> 1:23:21.250
What police station are you at?

1:23:22.498 --> 1:23:24.125
They came so close.

1:23:24.249 --> 1:23:26.297
I just want to go home, Mom.

1:23:26.835 --> 1:23:28.462
<i>Please come get me.</i>

1:23:28.587 --> 1:23:29.839
<i>- Please.</i>
- Okay.

1:23:30.088 --> 1:23:31.590
I'm coming to get you.

1:23:31.715 --> 1:23:33.934
What police station are you at?

1:23:34.259 --> 1:23:35.932
Hold on. Let me ask.

1:23:38.013 --> 1:23:39.731
Excuse me...

1:23:46.063 --> 1:23:47.064
Paul?

1:24:48.875 --> 1:24:50.969
Now, you go first.

1:24:52.546 --> 1:24:54.469
No, you moved it.

1:25:06.143 --> 1:25:07.611
All right, go ahead. Your move.

1:25:32.377 --> 1:25:34.345
Watch the kids. I'll be back in a while.

1:25:34.504 --> 1:25:37.053
What? What am I supposed to feed them?

1:25:37.257 --> 1:25:39.510
You'll figure it out.

1:25:56.735 --> 1:25:57.987
Mrs. Getty.

1:25:58.278 --> 1:26:03.284
My situation is urgent.

1:26:04.326 --> 1:26:06.124
Please, if you could give me

1:26:06.244 --> 1:26:09.544
- any idea as to the...
- Let me help you. Follow me.

1:26:19.466 --> 1:26:22.766
This piece came from my

1:26:23.178 --> 1:26:26.273
former father-in-law's personal collection.

1:26:26.390 --> 1:26:29.314
By his own estimate, it would bring

1:26:29.518 --> 1:26:33.068
1.2 million at auction,
and that was years ago.

1:26:33.355 --> 1:26:35.949
Ms. Getty, this is <i>un gingillo,</i>

1:26:36.274 --> 1:26:39.244
a trinket of the type sold to tourists.

1:26:46.118 --> 1:26:48.462
J. Paul Getty is the foremost
collector in the world.

1:26:48.578 --> 1:26:50.797
Do you really believe that
you know better than he does?

1:26:50.914 --> 1:26:52.166
No, <i>signora,</i> I do not.

1:26:53.041 --> 1:26:56.295
But I do know what my eyes see.

1:26:57.838 --> 1:26:58.885
Thank you for your time.

1:26:59.005 --> 1:27:03.226
Mrs. Getty, you might start
at the Capitoline Museum.

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:05.929
Ask for this person.

1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:26.184
Paul? Paul.

1:28:28.178 --> 1:28:29.350
Come on.

1:28:29.554 --> 1:28:31.306
Drink.

1:28:32.057 --> 1:28:33.684
- Fast as you can swallow.
- Why?

1:28:33.809 --> 1:28:34.936
Come on, drink.

1:28:35.060 --> 1:28:36.232
- Drink.
- Why?

1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:38.238
We take turns. Look.

1:28:38.939 --> 1:28:39.940
Okay.

1:28:41.691 --> 1:28:42.943
It tastes like piss.

1:28:43.068 --> 1:28:44.695
Okay, drink, drink, drink.

1:28:45.070 --> 1:28:47.164
You drink enough,
you can't feel a thing, okay?

1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:49.283
Who the fuck is that?

1:28:49.407 --> 1:28:52.035
He's... He's a good doctor.

1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:53.127
- He's a good doctor.
- What?

1:28:53.245 --> 1:28:55.122
You don't even feel it. This, I promise.

1:28:55.247 --> 1:28:57.170
What are you talking about?

1:28:57.374 --> 1:28:58.796
What do you mean, I'm not gonna feel it?

1:29:00.544 --> 1:29:02.012
What's he gonna do?

1:29:02.128 --> 1:29:03.630
Paolo.

1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:05.974
These men are going to take a part of you.

1:29:06.258 --> 1:29:08.010
The ear.

1:29:08.593 --> 1:29:12.097
Let them have it, and live.

1:29:12.222 --> 1:29:14.270
No, they're not gonna take my fucking ear.

1:29:15.559 --> 1:29:17.027
No, no, tell them don't do it.

1:29:17.143 --> 1:29:18.440
Paolo, he's a good doctor.

1:29:18.687 --> 1:29:20.314
No. No.

1:29:20.438 --> 1:29:22.111
- Don't do it. No.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1:29:22.232 --> 1:29:24.576
No, get the fuck off me. No.

1:29:25.026 --> 1:29:26.619
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Get the fuck off me!

1:29:28.071 --> 1:29:29.243
Get off of me!

1:29:29.364 --> 1:29:31.332
- Get off of me!
- Hey, look at me!

1:29:31.491 --> 1:29:33.289
- Get off! Off me!
- Paolo, look at me!

1:29:33.410 --> 1:29:35.504
- No matter what happens, look at me!
- Get off!

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:36.667
Look at me!

1:29:38.665 --> 1:29:40.133
Okay. New breath.

1:29:40.250 --> 1:29:43.629
Look at me! Paolo, okay, okay.

1:29:43.753 --> 1:29:45.471
Good boy. Strong boy. Bravo.

1:29:45.589 --> 1:29:46.590
Okay.

1:30:52.739 --> 1:30:54.036
It's okay. Paolo.

1:30:54.157 --> 1:30:55.659
My eyes. Look at my eyes.

1:30:56.201 --> 1:30:57.919
It's okay, it's okay. Soon, it's over.

1:30:58.244 --> 1:31:00.463
My eyes. My eyes.

1:31:09.339 --> 1:31:10.932
Look at me. It's okay.

1:32:35.925 --> 1:32:37.677
Almost over.

1:32:55.987 --> 1:32:57.205
That's him.

1:32:59.783 --> 1:33:02.332
No, no. The evidence.

1:33:03.745 --> 1:33:05.748
He's alive.

1:33:06.915 --> 1:33:08.292
<i>We would like to publish it,</i>

1:33:08.541 --> 1:33:09.838
Ms. Getty.

1:33:10.418 --> 1:33:12.261
The photograph of the ear.

1:33:15.215 --> 1:33:17.183
It's news,

1:33:18.051 --> 1:33:20.224
and we are a newspaper.

1:33:20.678 --> 1:33:24.057
It's my son's ear.

1:33:24.974 --> 1:33:26.101
It's his.

1:33:27.060 --> 1:33:28.027
It's ours.

1:33:28.144 --> 1:33:31.398
And that's why we want
to offer some compensation.

1:33:32.148 --> 1:33:36.073
I don't want to sell you
pictures of my son's ear.

1:33:36.361 --> 1:33:38.864
Ms. Getty, your son is being held for ransom.

1:33:39.072 --> 1:33:40.619
You claim not to have any money.

1:33:41.199 --> 1:33:43.076
Yeah.

1:33:43.451 --> 1:33:45.078
Yes, I remember it was your paper

1:33:45.203 --> 1:33:47.046
that reported I was
two months behind in my rent.

1:33:47.413 --> 1:33:50.212
- It was news.
- How much money are you offering?

1:33:50.750 --> 1:33:52.343
$50,000 American.

1:33:59.342 --> 1:34:00.685
We'll leave you alone now.

1:34:01.594 --> 1:34:02.721
Enjoy your coffee.

1:34:06.307 --> 1:34:08.435
Pay me in newspapers.

1:34:09.519 --> 1:34:10.816
I don't want any money.

1:34:10.937 --> 1:34:14.441
I want 1,000 copies of your paper.

1:34:14.858 --> 1:34:18.533
And where would you like
these thousand copies sent, Ms. Getty?

1:34:27.495 --> 1:34:28.792
What is it?

1:34:29.622 --> 1:34:31.625
Open it up. Let me see.

1:34:55.565 --> 1:34:56.862
<i>Paul is weak.</i>

1:34:57.358 --> 1:34:59.986
<i>He's lost so much blood.</i>

1:35:00.111 --> 1:35:01.988
<i>They wanted to take the foot,</i>

1:35:02.113 --> 1:35:04.867
<i>and I convinced them to take the ear.</i>

1:35:04.991 --> 1:35:07.164
<i>But the foot is coming next.</i>

1:35:07.785 --> 1:35:09.708
I hear them talking.

1:35:09.829 --> 1:35:12.503
I beg you, get the money.

1:35:12.916 --> 1:35:16.011
Tell us where you are.

1:35:16.127 --> 1:35:19.347
We'll make a deal with you in
exchange for your cooperation.

1:35:24.469 --> 1:35:26.346
We'll get you out of Italy.

1:35:26.638 --> 1:35:29.357
No, no, no. You don't understand.

1:35:29.474 --> 1:35:31.898
I can never talk to the police.

1:35:32.477 --> 1:35:34.730
It's <i>onore.</i>

1:35:35.188 --> 1:35:37.111
It is forbidden.

1:35:37.523 --> 1:35:40.868
Even if this was my own child.

1:35:42.153 --> 1:35:44.622
There must be something that you can do.

1:35:44.739 --> 1:35:46.457
<i>And what about you,</i> signora?

1:35:47.325 --> 1:35:49.544
I've risked my throat for your son.

1:35:49.661 --> 1:35:52.039
And you, what have you given for him?

1:35:52.163 --> 1:35:53.836
And don't tell me you don't have the money.

1:35:53.957 --> 1:35:54.958
What have you done?

1:36:00.088 --> 1:36:01.556
You...

1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:15.527
Yes.

1:36:15.645 --> 1:36:17.397
<i>Ms. Getty, this is Oswald Hinge in London.</i>

1:36:17.522 --> 1:36:18.694
<i>I'm sure you don't remember me.</i>

1:36:19.315 --> 1:36:20.612
Mr. Hinge.

1:36:24.696 --> 1:36:26.198
I haven't forgotten a thing.

1:36:26.322 --> 1:36:28.541
I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Getty.

1:36:28.658 --> 1:36:30.251
Not your former husband.

1:36:31.119 --> 1:36:33.087
The old one with the money.

1:36:33.204 --> 1:36:34.331
<i>That's the one.</i>

1:36:34.998 --> 1:36:36.625
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

1:36:36.833 --> 1:36:40.053
Mr. Getty has decided to pay Paul's ransom.

1:36:48.052 --> 1:36:49.474
Thank you, Mr. Hinge.

1:36:50.596 --> 1:36:52.894
<i>You thank him. I am but a messenger.</i>

1:36:53.308 --> 1:36:54.855
Well, I would if he'd let me.

1:36:55.476 --> 1:36:56.853
Well, you'll get your chance.

1:36:57.937 --> 1:37:01.157
We'll need you to come
to London for some discussions.

1:37:01.274 --> 1:37:02.526
What is there to discuss?

1:37:03.026 --> 1:37:05.029
Thank you very much.

1:37:10.325 --> 1:37:12.328
He's going to pay.

1:37:24.422 --> 1:37:25.389
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1:37:25.506 --> 1:37:26.507
Are you finished with that, madam?

1:37:26.632 --> 1:37:27.599
<i>This is the captain.</i>

1:37:27.717 --> 1:37:30.015
<i>We're on our final approach
into London Heathrow.</i>

1:37:30.136 --> 1:37:32.264
<i>Scheduled to land in around 10 to 15 minutes.</i>

1:37:32.388 --> 1:37:33.515
May I take that, sir?

1:37:33.639 --> 1:37:35.516
<i>Slightly cooler today, 16 degrees Celsius.</i>

1:37:35.641 --> 1:37:37.188
- Are you finished with that?
<i>- On behalf of all the crew,</i>

1:37:37.310 --> 1:37:39.529
<i>we wish you a very pleasant onward journey.</i>

1:37:47.111 --> 1:37:49.409
Gentlemen. Ms. Abigail Getty.

1:37:52.742 --> 1:37:54.085
Mr. Chace.

1:38:08.716 --> 1:38:10.093
Well, you'll be happy to learn

1:38:10.218 --> 1:38:12.642
that there are some new developments,

1:38:12.887 --> 1:38:17.359
which will enable us to finally
help our Little Paul.

1:38:17.725 --> 1:38:19.693
So glad to hear it.

1:38:19.811 --> 1:38:22.530
My tax attorneys have discovered that

1:38:22.730 --> 1:38:26.360
while ransom payments are not
deductible under the tax code.

1:38:26.484 --> 1:38:27.952
I could write off the interest

1:38:28.277 --> 1:38:32.328
if I loan the ransom money to my son.

1:38:38.413 --> 1:38:39.505
You've discovered you can

1:38:39.622 --> 1:38:42.467
take my son's kidnapping as a tax deduction.

1:38:45.336 --> 1:38:47.430
I'm happy it works out financially for you.

1:38:47.547 --> 1:38:50.266
I think we can all agree
the most important thing

1:38:50.383 --> 1:38:52.056
is getting Paul home safely.

1:38:52.552 --> 1:38:53.895
- And soon.
- Yes, soon.

1:38:55.555 --> 1:38:56.852
Soon as possible, please.

1:38:56.973 --> 1:38:58.441
Well, the loan documents are ready,

1:38:58.558 --> 1:39:01.812
and the funds are ready to be transferred.

1:39:03.438 --> 1:39:06.192
Paul will be so grateful to his grandpa
when he gets home.

1:39:06.357 --> 1:39:08.234
He loves you.

1:39:08.401 --> 1:39:09.903
More than you know.

1:39:10.736 --> 1:39:12.704
And I love him.

1:39:12.822 --> 1:39:16.042
There's just the matter of the side letter.

1:39:17.493 --> 1:39:18.836
If I may, the...

1:39:19.495 --> 1:39:21.839
In exchange for Mr. Getty making the loan,

1:39:21.956 --> 1:39:25.836
you agree to sign over full
custody of all your children,

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:28.964
including Paul, to your ex-husband.

1:39:32.467 --> 1:39:33.889
"Sign over"?

1:39:34.010 --> 1:39:37.765
Yes, all parental rights
reside with Mr. Getty.

1:39:38.806 --> 1:39:40.274
Just here.

1:39:44.979 --> 1:39:46.606
Are you part of this?

1:39:51.110 --> 1:39:52.282
They can't do this, can they?

1:39:52.403 --> 1:39:54.906
My legal team is the best there is.

1:39:55.698 --> 1:39:59.043
If it wouldn't stand up in court,
they wouldn't have written it.

1:39:59.202 --> 1:40:00.920
Now, you just take it easy.

1:40:01.037 --> 1:40:06.510
Sleep on it and have your
attorney read it over.

1:40:06.751 --> 1:40:08.298
I don't have time to sleep on it.

1:40:08.419 --> 1:40:10.513
My child is being held prisoner.

1:40:11.255 --> 1:40:13.633
Well, there is that.

1:40:14.342 --> 1:40:15.935
I let you have the money back then.

1:40:16.052 --> 1:40:17.599
I didn't ask for anything but my kids.

1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:20.439
You just can't bear to leave
anything on the table, can you?

1:40:32.777 --> 1:40:33.778
Thank you.

1:40:39.283 --> 1:40:40.660
We have a problem.

1:40:42.119 --> 1:40:44.588
Getty has agreed to loan his son the ransom,

1:40:44.705 --> 1:40:46.378
up to the amount that is tax deductible.

1:40:46.499 --> 1:40:47.500
So?

1:40:47.667 --> 1:40:49.294
So, I investigate.

1:40:49.418 --> 1:40:52.968
Under US tax code,
only the first million is deductible.

1:40:53.089 --> 1:40:54.386
That's all they wired to us.

1:40:55.383 --> 1:40:57.010
What is the ransom down to?

1:40:57.134 --> 1:40:59.011
Four. Down from 17.

1:40:59.554 --> 1:41:01.522
We don't have four. We have one.

1:41:14.443 --> 1:41:16.946
<i>Meno male, it's almost over.</i>

1:41:17.822 --> 1:41:19.369
<i>What is Paul's condition?</i>

1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:21.162
<i>He's not so good,</i>

1:41:21.409 --> 1:41:24.254
<i>but we can keep him alive a few days.</i>

1:41:24.370 --> 1:41:26.543
<i>Long enough to make the exchange.</i>

1:41:26.664 --> 1:41:28.211
We may not have all of it.

1:41:28.332 --> 1:41:29.504
<i>All of what?</i>

1:41:30.543 --> 1:41:32.261
We only have one million.

1:41:32.378 --> 1:41:34.506
<i>The number is four.</i>

1:41:34.630 --> 1:41:36.348
One is the new number.

1:41:36.465 --> 1:41:37.683
<i>One</i>

1:41:38.134 --> 1:41:40.808
is one quarter of the ransom.

1:41:41.012 --> 1:41:43.640
For this, they'll send
one quarter of your son.

1:41:43.764 --> 1:41:45.562
<i>Tell me, which quarter do you want?</i>

1:41:46.225 --> 1:41:48.398
Did you hold the kid down
so they could cut off his ear?

1:41:48.519 --> 1:41:50.362
You greedy animals.

1:41:50.479 --> 1:41:52.231
You're the worst criminals of all.

1:41:52.356 --> 1:41:53.357
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1:41:53.482 --> 1:41:56.486
<i>I don't have any money
to make from this anymore.</i>

1:41:57.153 --> 1:42:00.623
But I don't want Paul to die.

1:42:00.781 --> 1:42:03.626
<i>You have to go back and get Getty to pay.</i>

1:42:05.119 --> 1:42:06.792
You have to get me some time here.

1:42:06.912 --> 1:42:08.380
I'm fighting an empire.

1:42:10.333 --> 1:42:12.381
You think you're the only one?

1:42:21.510 --> 1:42:23.012
I need to speak to him.

1:42:23.596 --> 1:42:27.692
<i>Mr. Getty is unable
to receive guests at this hour, ma'am.</i>

1:42:30.686 --> 1:42:33.610
We can't stay here. They'll call the police.

1:42:33.856 --> 1:42:35.779
Let them.

1:42:37.109 --> 1:42:38.452
Look, we have the million.

1:42:38.736 --> 1:42:40.659
For a million, they'll kill him.

1:42:41.364 --> 1:42:43.492
They won't believe me when I say
I don't have the rest of the money.

1:42:43.616 --> 1:42:44.743
Nobody believes me.

1:42:45.284 --> 1:42:47.582
There was never any guarantees, Gail.

1:42:49.038 --> 1:42:50.415
The money would give us a chance,

1:42:50.539 --> 1:42:53.384
maybe a window of opportunity to grab him.

1:42:53.918 --> 1:42:55.966
- Maybe not even that.
- The money, the money,

1:42:56.087 --> 1:42:57.305
the money, the money, the money.

1:42:57.421 --> 1:42:59.298
I can't bear to hear about the money.

1:42:59.715 --> 1:43:01.183
Everybody thinks I have the money.

1:43:01.300 --> 1:43:04.179
The newspapers, kidnappers,
they all think I'm rich.

1:43:04.512 --> 1:43:06.389
You know what they call that?

1:43:06.764 --> 1:43:08.391
Credit.

1:43:13.729 --> 1:43:18.451
We announce I have
the ransom money, all four million.

1:43:18.567 --> 1:43:21.867
We make the exchange. You get your window.

1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:25.579
And what happens when they find
out the money's not all there?

1:43:26.033 --> 1:43:28.502
By that time, we either have Paul or...

1:43:33.207 --> 1:43:35.551
Now you're thinking like Getty.

1:43:37.211 --> 1:43:38.178
Excuse me, please.

1:43:38.295 --> 1:43:39.262
Excuse us, please. Excuse me.

1:43:39.380 --> 1:43:40.472
- All right, stand by.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

1:43:40.589 --> 1:43:41.966
Thank you.

1:43:44.176 --> 1:43:46.304
Good morning, everybody.

1:43:46.429 --> 1:43:48.102
Mrs. Abigail Getty.

1:43:55.771 --> 1:43:58.365
Following a long

1:43:59.900 --> 1:44:02.949
and difficult negotiation
with my son's kidnappers,

1:44:03.279 --> 1:44:07.751
<i>I have decided to meet their demands
and pay the ransom in full.</i>

1:44:08.075 --> 1:44:11.124
<i>I cannot begin to describe the impact</i>

1:44:11.245 --> 1:44:14.169
<i>this event has had on our family.</i>

1:44:14.457 --> 1:44:16.380
<i>For anyone to be abducted is bad enough.</i>

1:44:16.625 --> 1:44:18.343
- Bullimore.
<i>- Let alone a child who should be safe</i>

1:44:18.461 --> 1:44:19.963
<i>with his family is another matter entirely.</i>

1:44:20.087 --> 1:44:22.090
- Sir.
- Get me Chace.

1:44:22.214 --> 1:44:24.057
<i>...Abigail Getty, mother of the kidnapped</i>

1:44:24.175 --> 1:44:25.802
John Paul Getty III.

1:44:26.010 --> 1:44:27.387
<i>It was at 3:00 a.m. on the morning...</i>

1:44:30.890 --> 1:44:32.893
Morning, Chace.

1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:38.655
Will you help me with this?

1:44:46.030 --> 1:44:49.751
I'm building a house in California.

1:44:51.202 --> 1:44:55.423
An exact replica of
my imperial villa in Rome,

1:44:55.581 --> 1:44:57.083
down to the very last detail.

1:44:57.541 --> 1:44:59.794
But with flush toilets.

1:45:00.711 --> 1:45:03.135
Yes. The mountain may not
have come to Muhammad,

1:45:03.255 --> 1:45:05.508
but it sure as hell came to me.

1:45:06.008 --> 1:45:07.681
Mr. Getty.

1:45:07.802 --> 1:45:09.805
The West Texas Intermediate, sir.

1:45:12.973 --> 1:45:16.022
What's it feel like,
reading that slip of paper?

1:45:16.727 --> 1:45:18.400
Well, for a moment,

1:45:18.604 --> 1:45:24.077
money loses all meaning
and becomes as plentiful as air.

1:45:24.276 --> 1:45:26.950
Like flight.

1:45:27.363 --> 1:45:28.990
And then it passes.

1:45:31.450 --> 1:45:34.875
What's all this I see on TV

1:45:34.995 --> 1:45:38.420
with Gail paying the ransom in full?

1:45:38.707 --> 1:45:40.334
We both know she doesn't have it.

1:45:40.668 --> 1:45:42.966
The lady's made other arrangements.

1:45:43.128 --> 1:45:45.506
But she doesn't have the money.

1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:48.969
So, what's going on?

1:45:49.301 --> 1:45:52.020
Come on. Where did she get it?

1:45:52.137 --> 1:45:53.730
Is she fucking somebody?

1:45:56.308 --> 1:45:59.403
You know, I think I'm finally beginning
to understand what makes you tick.

1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:01.818
No, no, you couldn't begin to.

1:46:02.606 --> 1:46:04.825
So, spill it.

1:46:04.984 --> 1:46:07.658
What's going on? What's her game?

1:46:07.862 --> 1:46:10.365
Don't forget, Chace, I have a contract.

1:46:10.489 --> 1:46:12.036
And I'll enforce it.

1:46:12.366 --> 1:46:15.211
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?

1:46:15.327 --> 1:46:17.079
Can you hear me?

1:46:17.288 --> 1:46:19.791
I want to make sure that I am very clear.

1:46:19.915 --> 1:46:23.214
Because whatever personal security
you presently enjoy comes from me.

1:46:23.460 --> 1:46:26.384
All right? Those Alsatians
limping around the pool?

1:46:26.505 --> 1:46:27.927
My people trained them.

1:46:28.048 --> 1:46:29.891
Your security system? My people installed it.

1:46:30.009 --> 1:46:32.558
The bodyguards? That's right,
you rapacious old fuck,

1:46:32.678 --> 1:46:34.555
you are protected from
every threat imaginable,

1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:36.353
unless that threat happens to be me.

1:46:36.473 --> 1:46:39.602
I suppose this is your way
of submitting your resignation.

1:46:39.727 --> 1:46:40.899
Hey!

1:46:42.271 --> 1:46:43.363
"Men of risk"?

1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:45.073
Isn't that what you called us?

1:46:45.190 --> 1:46:46.863
"I risk my money. You risk your life."

1:46:47.067 --> 1:46:48.740
You're so full of shit.

1:46:48.944 --> 1:46:51.663
You and me? We never risked
a thing in our lives.

1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:53.703
We never took the chances
ordinary people take.

1:46:54.116 --> 1:46:55.743
That's why we are what we are now.

1:46:55.951 --> 1:46:56.952
You're just cheap, Paul.

1:46:57.077 --> 1:46:58.579
You could have all the money in the world,

1:46:58.704 --> 1:47:00.251
and you are still a no-good
miserable son of a bitch,

1:47:00.414 --> 1:47:02.883
and don't you forget it.

1:47:04.168 --> 1:47:05.670
Goodbye, Mr. Getty.

1:47:07.463 --> 1:47:10.012
Those children are my blood, Chace!

1:47:16.096 --> 1:47:17.564
They're mine.

1:47:24.021 --> 1:47:25.989
She took them.

1:47:47.127 --> 1:47:48.754
The money came through.

1:47:48.879 --> 1:47:50.802
It was the full ransom.

1:47:51.006 --> 1:47:52.849
$3.3 million.

1:47:52.967 --> 1:47:57.063
At today's exchange rate, 1.6 billion lira.

1:47:57.429 --> 1:48:00.808
They wired this along with the money.

1:48:03.686 --> 1:48:05.188
Getty caved.

1:48:05.312 --> 1:48:06.939
What did you say to him?

1:48:07.773 --> 1:48:09.400
I couldn't even tell you.

1:48:11.902 --> 1:48:14.200
<i>I'll make the exchange on my own.</i>

1:48:14.488 --> 1:48:16.081
<i>La Signora</i> Getty only.

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:17.787
<i>She'd be in a car
with millions of dollars, okay?</i>

1:48:17.908 --> 1:48:19.285
<i>The whole world knows what she looks like.</i>

1:48:19.410 --> 1:48:21.413
<i>She could be robbed on the highway.</i>

1:48:22.037 --> 1:48:23.380
That's your problem.

1:48:24.707 --> 1:48:25.708
<i>Then we both go.</i>

1:48:25.833 --> 1:48:27.085
<i>Non-negotiable.</i>

1:49:04.705 --> 1:49:07.709
Because of the fuel crisis
and rationing measures,

1:49:07.833 --> 1:49:10.712
no cars will be allowed
on the roads on Sunday.

1:49:10.961 --> 1:49:13.430
<i>This way, all the roads will be empty,</i>

1:49:13.547 --> 1:49:16.175
<i>and so, they can see if Gail is followed.</i>

1:49:37.863 --> 1:49:40.082
<i>Drive a Fiat 125</i>

1:49:40.199 --> 1:49:43.453
<i>with two suitcases tied to the roof.</i>

1:49:43.911 --> 1:49:47.461
<i>Exit the autostrada tollgate at 9:00 a.m.</i>

1:49:47.581 --> 1:49:51.586
<i>and drive south at exactly
80 kilometers an hour.</i>

1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:15.326
<i>Do not stop for food, toilet, nothing.</i>

1:50:15.943 --> 1:50:18.367
<i>Remember, they're watching.</i>

1:50:28.163 --> 1:50:31.417
<i>A small stone will strike your windshield.</i>

1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:35.964
<i>This will be their sign to stop.</i>

1:50:38.173 --> 1:50:42.178
Obey these rules,
or they will take his other ear.

1:50:43.053 --> 1:50:44.771
His eye.

1:50:45.097 --> 1:50:46.815
A hand.

1:50:54.940 --> 1:50:56.283
That's it.

1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:23.803
Come on.

1:54:03.754 --> 1:54:05.848
Okay, come on.

1:54:05.964 --> 1:54:07.216
Okay.

1:54:07.341 --> 1:54:08.684
You look good.

1:54:08.884 --> 1:54:11.763
You can't go home to your mother
looking like a <i>sciattone.</i>

1:54:16.933 --> 1:54:20.563
Stay there and don't move, or we kill you.

1:54:22.814 --> 1:54:23.815
Okay.

1:54:31.865 --> 1:54:32.866
Hey, Paolo.

1:54:32.991 --> 1:54:34.334
Don't wait. Run.

1:54:34.493 --> 1:54:36.336
And get out of Italy.

1:54:44.586 --> 1:54:45.883
You, too.

1:54:54.471 --> 1:54:57.520
<i>Three kilometers down
the road is a work site.</i>

1:54:57.641 --> 1:54:58.859
<i>Paul waits there for you.</i>

1:56:13.884 --> 1:56:15.386
Footprints.

1:56:16.470 --> 1:56:18.063
They made the drop.

1:56:24.728 --> 1:56:26.025
He ran.

1:56:31.026 --> 1:56:33.245
Who's there?

1:56:46.291 --> 1:56:48.294
Bullimore!

1:57:55.944 --> 1:57:58.242
- I can't get involved.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:57:58.905 --> 1:57:59.906
No!

1:58:35.483 --> 1:58:37.406
Bullimore?

1:59:35.460 --> 1:59:36.928
No, no, no, no.

2:00:40.692 --> 2:00:42.114
Paul?

2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:44.237
Hey, Paul!

2:00:49.242 --> 2:00:50.494
Paul!

2:00:56.833 --> 2:00:58.301
Stop. Enough.

2:01:00.420 --> 2:01:01.888
What are you looking at?

2:01:02.255 --> 2:01:03.552
Cinquanta.

2:01:04.883 --> 2:01:06.385
Get him out of Italy. Now!

2:01:08.428 --> 2:01:10.806
- What are you waiting for? Go!
- Come on.

2:01:17.312 --> 2:01:18.780
Paul.

2:01:28.615 --> 2:01:29.833
Fuck!

2:01:58.061 --> 2:01:59.608
Beautiful

2:02:01.022 --> 2:02:02.569
child.

2:02:18.122 --> 2:02:19.374
Come here.

2:02:23.503 --> 2:02:24.880
You're all right.

2:02:25.171 --> 2:02:26.718
You're all right.

2:03:01.875 --> 2:03:03.627
It's okay, it's okay.

2:03:07.213 --> 2:03:08.385
There.

2:03:09.674 --> 2:03:11.893
Mr. Hinge, Ms. Getty is here.

2:03:16.723 --> 2:03:17.895
Ms. Getty.

2:03:18.016 --> 2:03:19.188
Tea?

2:03:19.517 --> 2:03:21.019
No, thank you.

2:03:23.146 --> 2:03:27.743
Ms. Getty, we offer you
our sincerest condolences.

2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:30.782
Well, you're very thoughtful.

2:03:31.070 --> 2:03:32.447
Please, sit.

2:03:33.281 --> 2:03:37.081
Mr. Getty's death has created
a bit of a crisis here.

2:03:37.201 --> 2:03:39.204
You see, the estate was structured

2:03:39.370 --> 2:03:41.873
as a charitable family trust.

2:03:42.457 --> 2:03:44.255
Did he ever give any money to charity?

2:03:44.667 --> 2:03:45.964
No. No.

2:03:46.169 --> 2:03:48.342
The trust enabled Mr. Getty to

2:03:48.463 --> 2:03:50.932
build his fortune without paying taxes.

2:03:54.886 --> 2:03:57.264
There was just one catch.

2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:01.355
Under the rules of the trust,
he couldn't actually spend the money.

2:04:01.559 --> 2:04:04.859
What's the point of making all that
money if you can't spend it?

2:04:05.104 --> 2:04:07.448
Well, he couldn't spend it,
but he could invest it.

2:04:07.565 --> 2:04:09.659
So, he invested it in things.

2:04:09.943 --> 2:04:11.490
Art. Antiques.

2:04:11.653 --> 2:04:14.828
Soon, he had a...
A staggering amount of things.

2:04:15.073 --> 2:04:16.871
And a staggering amount of money.

2:04:16.991 --> 2:04:19.995
Now someone has to decide
what to do with it all.

2:04:20.119 --> 2:04:21.621
What do you want with me?

2:04:23.456 --> 2:04:24.799
How do I put this?

2:04:25.375 --> 2:04:28.675
The king is dead.

2:04:28.795 --> 2:04:31.469
The throne is vacant.

2:04:31.798 --> 2:04:34.677
Your children are his heirs.

2:04:35.176 --> 2:04:37.053
Until they come of age,

2:04:37.178 --> 2:04:39.772
someone has to make the decisions.

2:04:39.889 --> 2:04:41.812
Which means, of course,

2:04:41.933 --> 2:04:44.687
someone has to take his place.

2:04:57.198 --> 2:05:01.169
They're still finding masterpieces
stashed under staircases.

2:05:02.412 --> 2:05:05.006
Most of it's going to his villa in Malibu.

2:05:05.999 --> 2:05:07.717
Nowhere else could fit it all.

2:05:08.710 --> 2:05:10.303
- Careful.
- Yes, ma'am.

2:05:16.801 --> 2:05:18.553
Paul?

2:05:19.762 --> 2:05:21.856
Come say hello to Mr. Chace.

2:05:21.973 --> 2:05:25.022
Or goodbye. I'm not sure which.

2:05:29.981 --> 2:05:31.858
He's gonna be trouble with the ladies.

2:05:33.484 --> 2:05:35.487
I already am.

2:05:37.071 --> 2:05:38.573
I do hope you'll stay on with us.

2:05:38.698 --> 2:05:41.122
I know you had other ambitions, but...

2:05:41.367 --> 2:05:43.119
Guys like me don't get rich.

2:05:43.244 --> 2:05:45.918
We get sidetracked too easily.

2:05:46.372 --> 2:05:48.500
Shame.

2:05:48.708 --> 2:05:50.381
Not really.

2:05:50.960 --> 2:05:52.928
I think of you as family.

2:05:54.464 --> 2:05:56.262
Kind of you to say so, ma'am.

2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:03.724
Was a couple things around the grounds
that I was meaning to see to.

2:06:03.848 --> 2:06:05.521
Yes, of course. Don't let me keep you.

2:06:06.684 --> 2:06:08.106
Coming?

2:06:11.856 --> 2:06:14.826
- Let's go see the dogs.
- Okay.

2:06:32.168 --> 2:06:33.841
Ms. Getty?

2:06:33.961 --> 2:06:35.804
Is there anything we can help you with?

2:06:36.172 --> 2:06:37.765
No, thank you. I'm fine.

2:06:38.299 --> 2:06:40.142
I have everything I need.
