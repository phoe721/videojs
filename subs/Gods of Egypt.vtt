00:56.040 --> 00:58.540
Few know the whole story.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.281
From what I recall,
it goes something like this...

01:02.800 --> 01:04.780
Before history began,

01:04.880 --> 01:07.770
Egypt was the birthplace of all life.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.340
A paradise worthy of the gods
who created it.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.681
So the gods decided to live there

01:13.800 --> 01:16.565
alongside their lesser creation, man.

01:17.760 --> 01:21.300
But there was no mistaking the gods
amongst the mortals who worshipped them.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.803
The gods were taller with gold running
through their veins instead of blood.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.240
And they could transform at will
into all manner of frightening beasts.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.460
Egypt itself was divided
between two mighty brothers.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.740
Osiris, the God of Life,
was the beloved king

01:41.840 --> 01:43.888
of all the lands
made bountiful by the Nile.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.500
His brother, Set,
ruled the far barren desert

01:49.600 --> 01:54.100
finding both strength
and bitterness in his isolation.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.420
But then the time came
for Osiris to crown a new king.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.460
His only son, Horus.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.900
It was a decision that would
test the brothers' bond

02:03.000 --> 02:05.241
and the fate of all Egypt.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.322
But the gods are only half our tale.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.980
It had become clear that they couldn't
shape the course of destiny alone.

02:32.080 --> 02:37.060
A man of exceptional judgment,
wisdom and fortitude would be needed.

02:37.160 --> 02:41.060
Unfortunately, I was not such a man.

02:41.160 --> 02:45.370
But before you dismiss
my younger foolhardy self, remember...

02:46.680 --> 02:51.020
Never doubt a man fighting for the one
thing as powerful as any god.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.540
Three hundred, impossible.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.641
Love.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.450
Thief!

03:00.040 --> 03:01.565
Stop!

03:04.400 --> 03:08.140
This dress is hopeless.
I need to buy some ribbon to even begin

03:08.240 --> 03:10.420
to make it suitable for the coronation.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.660
I say we spend tomorrow together instead.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.764
We are spending tomorrow together.
At the coronation.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.100
We're blessed the gods shall give us
a new king in our lifetime.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.500
Horus?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.380
You know I couldn't care less
about the gods.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.860
Well, they care about you.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.930
- Oh, yeah?
- Bek! Give it back.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.168
I knew you wanted
to wear something special.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.540
Did you steal it from a shopkeeper
or from someone's closet?

03:36.640 --> 03:39.530
It was quicker than waiting
for the gods to answer my prayers.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.540
The gods give us everything we need.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.723
Yes. Their generosity knows no bounds.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.923
You look beautiful.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.740
Zaya, when I asked you
to run away with me,

03:53.840 --> 03:55.683
I promised you a good life.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.860
Dresses worthy of a princess.
A new one every day.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.900
Rivers of jewels to adorn you.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.005
- A golden palace to raise our family.
- And how many children would we have?

04:06.520 --> 04:07.760
A dozen.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.780
I would do anything to make you happy.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.965
And how was Horus, the
king-to-be, preparing for his great day?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.807
Lord of the Air.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.140
Quite an occasion last night.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.005
Already crowds press cheek-to-cheek
to catch a glimpse of you.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.326
You will look splendid.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.688
Eventually.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.020
Glorious, glorious Horus!

04:40.120 --> 04:42.646
But don't discount Horus yet either.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.380
Because when it comes to the fate
of the world in one's hands,

04:46.480 --> 04:49.484
even gods can be surprised
by the strength they possess.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.380
If I was to be crowned,
I might have spent the preceding hours

04:59.480 --> 05:01.020
composing a message for my people.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.900
Could the people love him more?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.540
Maybe Lord Horus doesn't think
we need boring speeches.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.580
Except when it comes
to toasting his own glory.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.740
Many toasts were required.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.100
I was doing deeds
of which songs will be sung.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.540
The great lion he slayed
was terrorizing villages.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.122
It was? Good. All the more song-worthy.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.244
That's nice.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.004
That's fine, thank...

05:26.680 --> 05:27.860
You.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.340
A shame I've come too late.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.728
But here I am, sober and clothed.
Don't tell anyone.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.487
I have a bad reputation to keep.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.140
Come here. Come.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.401
No. No, no. No, no!

05:50.640 --> 05:53.740
Hard to believe, but you look like a king.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.980
If that's what excites you,
who am I to judge?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.491
Jewelry excites me.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.380
Then look to your wrist,
if the effort is not too great.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.860
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.420
To remind you of the demons
I slayed for you.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.780
A more valuable treasure
Egypt has never known.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.300
This old thing?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.980
How can the Goddess of Love
not know what love is?

06:12.080 --> 06:17.060
It's not bedding any girl who flutters
her eyelashes, mighty lion-slayer.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.380
I was celebrating the hunt.
You would know that had you been here.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.500
I value my freedom. Dead animals less so.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.170
Well, you have no problem wearing them.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.220
- Oh...
- Hathor, don't.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.180
Don't.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.980
That's no way for a queen to behave.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.460
Then it's a good thing I'm not a queen.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.564
Can you imagine anything more dull
than sitting on a throne all day?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.768
What exactly are you asking me?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.121
Did I ask you something?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.120
I'm not sure. Did you?

06:53.360 --> 06:54.407
My Lord.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.241
It's starting.

07:46.680 --> 07:51.129
Hathor, Goddess of Love!

08:04.880 --> 08:09.920
Nephthys, Goddess of Protection!

08:17.240 --> 08:18.700
- Sir.
- Oh...

08:18.800 --> 08:21.007
Thank you, young man.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.085
You've been awfully nice to
strangers today. Show me your hands.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.446
- What? Gifts for Osiris.
- Hurry up!

08:31.440 --> 08:35.240
Thoth, God of Wisdom!

08:39.960 --> 08:42.140
Greetings, Thoth.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.380
Did you ever imagine
that your former student

08:44.480 --> 08:46.482
would one day wear the crown of Egypt?

08:47.320 --> 08:50.220
Horus evinced a range of attributes,

08:50.320 --> 08:53.100
some of which may well correlate
with a leadership position.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.441
If he's lucky.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.721
Praise Osiris!

09:02.520 --> 09:06.286
King of all Egypt!

09:07.680 --> 09:10.580
Hail Ra, Lord of Light.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.540
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

09:14.640 --> 09:17.769
My father has seen fit to bless this day

09:18.680 --> 09:22.162
as you all bless us with your generosity.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.400
A token from someone with much.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.290
And from someone with little.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.900
But when both die
and stand at the Final Gate,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.220
what is their value then?

09:41.320 --> 09:46.770
I say they are equal.
Symbols of lives well-lived.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.207
All are welcome to the Afterlife.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.923
This is my legacy.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.540
But today, we crown a new king.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.540
And one day, he will have
a legacy of his own.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.849
My son Horus, Lord of the Air.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.041
Are you ready?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.241
I am.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.561
Wait!

10:29.000 --> 10:32.180
Wait. Sorry, I'm late.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.100
Ugh, three days to cross the desert.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.771
And nearly one more to pass
through all your admirers.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.980
Set!

10:41.080 --> 10:44.820
- Brother. Good to see you.
- And you, brother.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.843
There's always a place for you here.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.844
Such a big day for the family.
You must be proud.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.580
I am.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.729
Look at you, nephew. Magnificent.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.780
At least someone here'll make a fine king.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.850
- I was afraid you wouldn't come.
- No, I wouldn't miss it.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.962
- For you.
- Oh...

11:05.920 --> 11:07.763
A hunting horn.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.620
From the skull of a ram that flattened
10 gods slower than me.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.940
It's beautiful.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.849
Yeah? Try it out.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.240
From Set.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.769
Come on! Let Ra himself hear you.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.002
I think someone heard you.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.285
What is this, Set?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.210
You recognize it?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.364
Father gave it to you.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.963
Kept me alive for many
a night in the desert.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.620
Fight me.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.802
- Father, don't.
- Stay out of this, son.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.060
Why?

12:36.160 --> 12:40.340
In 1,000 years of peace,
what have you accomplished?

12:40.440 --> 12:43.660
A land of people
who dream of nothing more.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.843
- It's my turn now.
- I won't fight.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.761
I love you, brother. With all my heart.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.164
I love you, too, brother.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.286
No!

13:00.800 --> 13:02.211
Osiris!

13:06.400 --> 13:10.610
Well, this truly is
a big day for the family.

13:11.880 --> 13:17.649
I, Set... shall be your one true king.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.680
King of all Egypt!

13:20.920 --> 13:23.924
Behold the fate
of those who stand in my way.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.560
Gods...

13:28.360 --> 13:30.886
Bow before me or die.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.249
Mortals, worship me or be enslaved!

13:45.320 --> 13:46.500
Bek!

13:46.600 --> 13:49.888
My brother thought
the Afterlife was a gift.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.367
I think a king should
have higher standards.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.367
From now on, you have to buy your way
in with riches earned.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.564
Your journey has just begun.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.009
It's yours now.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.680
Many of us will stand with you,
but now is not the time.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.368
- I looked up to you.
- Of course you did.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.048
That would be unwise.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.449
Is it true you still never miss?
Doesn't that get dull?

14:54.440 --> 14:56.204
I thought your sight was perfect.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.965
You fight well.
Are you so sure you're his son?

16:24.840 --> 16:26.126
Zaya!

16:27.000 --> 16:28.940
- Bek!
- Zaya!

16:29.040 --> 16:30.087
Bek!

17:01.320 --> 17:04.210
I'm doing Egypt a favor.
You're not fit to be King.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.441
No!

17:19.120 --> 17:20.281
No!

17:37.360 --> 17:38.407
Set!

17:54.960 --> 17:56.564
Forgive me, Father.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.001
Zaya!

18:05.680 --> 18:07.091
Zaya!

18:13.600 --> 18:16.331
And so Set was King.

18:17.040 --> 18:20.500
In the year that followed,
many gods stood against him.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.460
One by one, they paid with their lives.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.801
For mortals, things were worse.

18:27.720 --> 18:32.180
Most were forced into slavery,
and denied even the tiniest penny

18:32.280 --> 18:35.020
to buy our way into the Afterlife.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.300
Blinded and defeated,
Horus withdrew into exile.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.246
Those who prayed for him to save Egypt
were sorely disappointed.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.740
But I was never much for prayer.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.684
I had found Zaya
enslaved to a cruel master.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.940
But how could I free her from all this?

18:54.040 --> 18:56.691
It was the maddest of all plans.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.527
You may not control the wind, Zaya,
but I'd think you could close a shutter.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.760
Sorry, My Lord.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.060
Pretty one, if ever I find
my desk disordered again,

19:21.160 --> 19:24.323
I'll throw you outside to push stone.
Is that clear?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.842
Come on, come on! Haven't got all day.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.580
I'd like to drop him from a great height.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.284
Morning.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.700
One day, I'm going to steal
you away from him.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.060
Is theft always the answer?

19:46.160 --> 19:48.811
It is now in this world.
You're either rich or nothing.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.810
Even if you could free me,
what about my family? Our friends?

19:54.920 --> 19:57.127
Can you steal all Egypt away from Set?

19:57.880 --> 19:59.380
Only Horus can free us.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.324
- You really believe the gods care?
- If Horus could come, he would.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.806
I want to show you something.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.660
Set's army returns with spoils of war.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.300
His vault will be unlocked tonight.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.820
The perfect time
for someone to sneak inside.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.700
Why?

20:21.800 --> 20:23.660
They say Horus' eyes are kept there.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.180
He would have his power again.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.460
Steal from a god?

20:26.560 --> 20:29.180
Only a madman would try such a thing.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.567
Where do you suppose
we could find someone so mad?

20:33.040 --> 20:34.620
The plans should be here.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.200
Urshu built the vault.
He's Set's architect.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.620
What's this?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.927
Set's pyramid of sand.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.380
He's built himself quite the fire pit.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.300
He must cook massive feasts.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.340
It's the pit to the center of the world.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.330
The source of his power. No feasts.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.926
Found it.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.020
The treasure will pass
through the front gate.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.246
The front gate isn't the problem.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.020
It's what comes after.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.886
Two bridges rigged with traps.
Urshu boasts of them endlessly.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.326
Good thing I'm cheating.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.970
Welcome me properly, soldier.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.806
Don't keep the Queen of Egypt waiting.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.660
I think you missed me.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.620
I have to miss you.
I'm your prisoner, after all.

21:47.720 --> 21:51.281
- Oh, this prison's not so bad.
- Well, I'm miserable.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.300
You have a funny way of showing it.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.740
Can I borrow your knife?

21:56.840 --> 22:01.289
So if you had the chance, you'd kill me?

22:01.720 --> 22:03.324
How could I kill you?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.290
But you would if you could.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.248
Better keep your eyes open.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.690
Lord Set.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.540
Oh...

22:22.640 --> 22:24.768
And... Mistress.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.500
Perhaps I might come at a better time.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.329
No, come in. Don't be shy.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.281
Come on.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.340
No one has ever so honored
the great God Ra.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.820
He will pass over its peak and marvel

22:48.920 --> 22:50.968
at the tribute you have built in his name.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.980
Is that it?

22:54.080 --> 22:55.081
I'm sorry?

22:56.120 --> 22:58.202
Well, can you make it any taller?

22:59.280 --> 23:03.126
- Taller?
- Yes, it's a simple question.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.805
Well, that might be difficult, um,
now, I mean...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.446
Relax, Urshu. I'm joking.

23:13.240 --> 23:18.420
Tell me, why'd your father
choose you to be master builder

23:18.520 --> 23:20.740
rather than one of your brothers?

23:20.840 --> 23:22.980
I suppose because I proved
to be the best, My Lord.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.924
As I shall prove
to be the best to my father.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.860
He shall see it from dawn to dusk.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.940
Your satisfaction is worth more than gold.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.820
Oh, gold, gold!

23:34.920 --> 23:36.780
You'll have plenty enough
gold for the Afterlife.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.166
A toast!

23:39.240 --> 23:41.242
To Egypt's greatest builder.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.321
A toast to my legacy.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.048
Whoa!

25:06.280 --> 25:08.362
Where do you even get that many scorpions?

25:43.920 --> 25:46.048
Enough to make you afraid
of your own shadow.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.887
"The circle is the trigger."

26:20.400 --> 26:21.845
So I'll go 'round.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.962
Well, that was easy.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.890
A third bridge.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.730
Doesn't say anything about a third bridge.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.404
This is criminal.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.131
And only one eye.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.660
Terrific.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.446
Zaya, you'd say a prayer,
I'll roll the bones.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.487
Zaya!

28:10.600 --> 28:12.284
I'm so sorry.

28:15.120 --> 28:19.603
As if using my house for your
fornicating were not sufficient...

28:23.840 --> 28:25.683
You dare steal from the King?

28:32.160 --> 28:35.607
I pride myself in an orderly office, Zaya.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.540
You never did understand that, did you?

28:38.640 --> 28:41.980
Oh, and this pathetic little
trinket of yours

28:42.080 --> 28:43.780
will save neither of you, I'm afraid.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.340
Set is your god.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.010
- It was all my idea.
- Liar!

28:52.880 --> 28:54.530
Give me back what you took.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.126
Thank you.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.402
- Feed them to the jackals.
- Wait!

29:09.400 --> 29:11.880
I took something else.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.809
Run!

29:36.240 --> 29:39.369
You did it. Where's the other?

29:39.880 --> 29:41.644
You know how hard it was
to steal that one?

30:01.480 --> 30:04.020
- I'll love you forever.
- Zaya.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.963
Death is not the end.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.770
Zaya.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.090
Whoa.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.245
I'll make it right, Zaya.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.408
I don't need any more worshippers.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.411
Tributes that rot and stink.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.005
Unless you brought more wine, get out.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.324
I'm no worshipper.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.367
What are you? Some thief?

31:30.880 --> 31:33.167
Yes. A thief.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.362
I have something Set took from you.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.321
No mortal could rob Set's vault.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.380
You pilfered one of my followers' corpses.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.007
- They never even got close.
- Give them to me.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.940
- Not yet.
- Give me my eyes.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.681
- I have a proposition.
- You bargain with me?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.540
You're lucky I'm willing to.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.483
You can't strike a three-legged elephant.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.700
You want a reward, I suppose? Gold?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.450
Gold I can steal.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.970
There's someone I want saved.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.765
From what?

32:46.680 --> 32:47.920
Death.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.620
Didn't your father teach
that death isn't the end?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.051
It can't be done.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.220
Well, figure it out.
You're Horus, Lord of the Air!

32:56.320 --> 32:57.970
Or maybe I'll just toss
what I have in the Nile.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.161
Wait.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.960
Stay with the living.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.883
Stay with the living.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.601
Stay with the living.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.900
She's gone beyond where I can reach her.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.220
- But you're a god.
- Gods may live 1,000 of your years,

33:24.320 --> 33:26.163
but we cannot cure mortality.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.740
It's time for her to walk the path.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.820
There must be something you can do.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.206
I've done all I can.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.220
Oh, thou who art everlasting,

33:35.320 --> 33:38.130
send your servant to guide
the dead to new life.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.490
Anubis, come forth.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.605
You are released.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.620
The doors of Earth are open to you.

34:12.720 --> 34:16.580
- You must begin your journey.
- She died a slave.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.081
Without treasure, she won't be allowed
through the Final Gate.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.220
What do you offer?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.368
She can't pass into the Afterlife.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.700
For you, Lord Anubis,

34:26.800 --> 34:29.201
Governor of the Bows,
who is upon his mountain,

34:31.720 --> 34:33.802
I have only my smile.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.249
So be it.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.446
Zaya!

34:41.200 --> 34:42.700
Zaya!

34:42.800 --> 34:44.290
The dead don't speak to the living.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.124
Stay on the path.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.366
Now give them to me.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.940
- You've done nothing!
- My eyes.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.220
Spend the rest of your days
wandering around sightless.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.780
I have nothing to lose. Do you understand?

35:17.880 --> 35:19.644
Give me my eyes.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.220
I will do anything to see
her again or I'll die trying.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.961
You want to hide from me?
Learn to talk less.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.329
Here.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.450
Where's the other?

35:43.640 --> 35:45.340
Where's the other?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.180
Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I...

35:47.280 --> 35:48.611
I'll snap your neck.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.521
You must hate Set for what
he did to your father.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.900
The pyramid.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.843
I know how to get into Set's pyramid.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.051
How?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.331
How?

36:05.520 --> 36:06.851
Oh...

36:09.560 --> 36:11.300
It's where he keeps
his power locked up, right?

36:11.400 --> 36:13.801
If I could get you inside,
could you kill him?

36:17.960 --> 36:19.530
How would you do that?

36:19.720 --> 36:22.580
- I saw the plans.
- Tell me.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.700
- I'll show you.
- Go on.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.131
If you bring Zaya back.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.325
There may be a way.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.900
No one may leave
the Afterlife once entered.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.283
But the journey through the Nine Gates
will take several days to complete.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.367
And only the King
can make Anubis turn back.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.980
If I kill Set and take back the crown

36:46.080 --> 36:48.447
before your beloved
reaches the Final Gate,

36:49.320 --> 36:50.845
I might be able to save her.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.840
Try to keep up.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.281
My magnificent bloody hounds.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.161
You are the true sons of Egypt.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.920
You are my children of iron and blood.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.280
No father could be more proud.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.611
The rebel gods have choked on our spears.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.260
The rest have retreated
to Nephthys' stronghold

37:27.360 --> 37:30.020
where they now stand ready to face us.

37:30.120 --> 37:35.251
But you, my legions of the desert,
will bring them reckoning!

37:38.400 --> 37:41.131
So take your fill of gold!

37:43.200 --> 37:45.980
And if you should fall in battle
and travel the Nine Gates,

37:46.080 --> 37:49.100
tell my brother who it is you worship!

37:49.200 --> 37:53.603
Division Set! Amarn! Ta! Rai! Fall in!

37:54.400 --> 37:57.006
Forward march!

38:08.200 --> 38:09.281
My Lord.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.321
Your royal treasury has been breached.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.451
Urshu...

38:18.200 --> 38:21.727
Wasn't the eye meant to lure
those loyal to Horus to their deaths?

38:22.440 --> 38:23.820
Yes, Lord.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.161
And weren't your traps...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.525
What was the term you used?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.131
Thief-proof?

38:31.760 --> 38:33.171
Yes, Lord.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.020
Can you pick up the trail?

38:35.120 --> 38:36.540
I'll find him.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.020
And find whichever of his allies

38:38.120 --> 38:41.124
was clever enough to steal back his eye.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.405
It was a mortal, Lord.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.805
A mortal?

38:56.280 --> 38:57.300
Who is she?

38:57.400 --> 38:58.740
His servant.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.660
In my defense, Lord...

39:00.760 --> 39:03.580
Believe me, I'm very curious
to hear what your excuse is.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.820
But not right now.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.160
Yes, Lord.

39:10.280 --> 39:14.140
Well, it appears you're not
the cleverest mortal in Egypt after all.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.571
This thief is.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.300
So what is your plan?

39:20.400 --> 39:24.041
To kill the God of the Desert,
we must kill the desert itself.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.089
Kill the desert?

39:26.560 --> 39:27.925
How do you kill the desert?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.123
We must go to my grandfather's.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.370
- He'll help us with our task.
- Your grandfather?

39:39.480 --> 39:41.562
You mean Ra? The Sun God, Ra?

39:42.840 --> 39:44.683
So where exactly is your grandfather?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.820
You're being funny, right?

39:49.920 --> 39:52.241
You think I'd put any effort
into trying to amuse you?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.940
It seems flying would be useful right now.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.963
Without both my eyes, I cannot transform.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.491
I need to pray for strength.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.260
Oh, that's not encouraging.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.740
Be silent or you'll reach
the bottom of this mountain

40:02.840 --> 40:04.171
much quicker than you reached the top.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.408
Great Ra, know my name.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.124
The Lord of the Air seeks your embrace.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.643
Grandfather, I need your help. Please!

40:53.760 --> 40:54.921
Impressed!

41:28.040 --> 41:29.565
Stay in my shadow.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.804
- Why?
- Just do as I say.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.008
Hail, thou Great God Ra.

41:37.960 --> 41:42.363
Normally, when a bird lands on my boat,
I kill it before it can shit.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.780
What is this? You dare bring a mortal
to the source of Creation?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.087
He's valuable to me.
I could not leave him behind.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.740
Why have you come?

41:53.840 --> 41:55.260
I would only ask something of you.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.660
Oh, in that case,

41:56.760 --> 42:00.740
I shall stop what I'm doing
and heed your bidding.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.540
Grandfather, I'm sorry.
I mean no disrespect.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.290
You don't know the difference.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.121
Stay there. Be quiet.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.569
I have work to do.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.491
And put the mortal below deck
if you want him to live.

43:56.680 --> 44:00.321
Crawl back to shadow, you stinking worm!

44:01.400 --> 44:05.007
You shall never feast on my creation!

44:06.480 --> 44:07.925
Try as you might.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.900
Things would be different if I could dwell

44:14.000 --> 44:16.380
amongst my children
in the garden of the Nile.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.420
It is my burden to fight
the demon Apophis night after night.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.330
Egypt must never be destroyed by Chaos.

44:23.480 --> 44:28.042
So, you see,
there are things worse than Set.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.060
You're wrong.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.780
That demon isn't the one
who murdered my father.

44:32.880 --> 44:36.020
- Murdered your son.
- They are both my sons.

44:36.120 --> 44:39.060
They were both equal in my eyes.
As is all of my creation.

44:39.160 --> 44:42.403
And the uncertainty
of its destiny is my will.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.970
So what is it actually
that brings you here?

44:53.920 --> 44:56.321
Allow me to fill my flask
with these waters.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.009
The waters are not mine.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.565
You plan to quench the desert fire.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.460
To kill Set.
To become King as your father wished.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.580
- Grant me the power to fly again.
- I heard your prayer the first time.

45:39.680 --> 45:42.206
I let you come here
and I grant you passage home.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.420
But after that?

45:44.520 --> 45:48.780
Without both my eyes,
I doubt I'm strong enough to beat Set.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.370
So become stronger.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.140
Have you been so lazy for so long

45:53.240 --> 45:56.060
that you've forgotten
every god's life is a journey?

45:56.160 --> 45:59.660
When you stray from your path,
you grow weak.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.444
Hey!

46:02.200 --> 46:05.124
Why are you lugging around this mortal?

46:05.240 --> 46:06.969
He had the gall to strike
a bargain with me.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.820
Not worth the papyrus
it's written on, hmm?

46:11.920 --> 46:14.844
What does it matter? He is but a mortal.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.700
I do not approve of how Set rules.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.326
But I'm uncertain
you would be much better.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.923
Lord, the last of the rebel gods
have retreated behind her walls.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.566
Every last one?

46:50.200 --> 46:51.740
Yes, sir.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.411
Good. Then they're ripe for the picking.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.520
Isn't this a bit excessive?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.562
She'd want them to fight
to the death anyway.

47:01.200 --> 47:04.488
- She was your wife.
- All the more reason to kill her.

47:06.160 --> 47:09.767
From now on,
this will be the way of things.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.251
Our way.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.365
Better get used to it.

48:11.320 --> 48:15.166
Is it right that a goddess
should perform such labor?

48:15.600 --> 48:20.322
Since you became King, the need
for burial shrouds has been great.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.130
- You could have been a queen.
- You should know why I could not.

48:27.040 --> 48:31.940
Then, when I asked you
to marry me, why did you say yes?

48:32.040 --> 48:34.646
I remember when you
rode out of the desert.

48:35.360 --> 48:39.365
Impetuous. Dashing. So handsome.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.283
I braved those stinging winds
just to be at your side.

48:43.560 --> 48:46.700
And imagined the great deeds
we would accomplish together.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.609
It didn't all sting.

48:50.040 --> 48:54.700
- Some parts were sweet.
- Perhaps.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.201
I still thought we could have been happy.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.048
I should have been enough to fulfill you.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.682
Nothing can fulfill me.

49:09.040 --> 49:13.409
That's why Ra was wise to ensure
you would never have a child.

49:34.040 --> 49:36.340
Why?

49:36.440 --> 49:39.330
No one will know, until it's too late.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.451
Maybe next time, keep flying
until we're actually on the ground.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.086
What Ra gave, he took back.

50:11.440 --> 50:14.330
- I thought he was helping you.
- I got what I needed.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.420
The whole of the Nile
cannot quench Set's fire.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.860
But a few drops from
the water of Creation can.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.580
Kill the desert.

50:22.680 --> 50:25.380
With his fire gone, Set will be weakened.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.700
Vulnerable.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.404
What would happen if I drank that?

50:29.360 --> 50:33.020
You would be refreshed.
Then you would die.

50:33.120 --> 50:36.380
It doesn't seem right that the water
of Creation would kill.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.165
I would kill you. For wasting my water.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.940
What's this?

50:43.040 --> 50:45.964
So you don't have to bring me something
to drink cupped in your hands.

50:46.520 --> 50:48.363
I'm not your slave.

50:48.480 --> 50:51.900
My father taught me it's unworthy
of a god to strike a man.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.844
He should have taught you to get off
your arse and get your own water.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.325
Sorry, Father.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.443
This is becoming unacceptable.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.140
Where is the Eye of Horus?

51:29.240 --> 51:32.130
Up your behind, alongside the goats
you keep up there.

51:33.720 --> 51:36.451
Where is the Eye of Horus?

51:37.520 --> 51:38.646
Right here.

51:40.240 --> 51:43.608
I thought you were crawling
sightless in the mud somewhere.

51:44.160 --> 51:45.889
Cut him down!

51:58.120 --> 52:01.602
See, brothers?
Without his other eye, he is weak.

52:50.920 --> 52:56.689
Even if I were blind, deaf,
bereft of limbs...

52:58.720 --> 53:00.324
You're still no match for me.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.740
You'll be glad to know
I didn't fall to my death.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.140
Praise Ra.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.540
The deal doesn't count if I die.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.380
The whole point is for Zaya
and I both to be here, together.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.641
Breathing!

53:16.560 --> 53:17.686
Behind you!

53:27.000 --> 53:29.480
Horus!

53:36.600 --> 53:38.967
Oh, Ra, dear Ra, please, help us!

53:40.800 --> 53:42.370
Horus!

53:43.480 --> 53:45.369
We are going to die!

54:01.520 --> 54:03.170
After you.

54:14.160 --> 54:17.260
- Are you sure you can do this?
- I saved you, didn't I?

54:17.360 --> 54:19.820
- Oh, you saved me?
- Only because you're useful to me.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.844
You know what would be useful?
Your other eye.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.500
I could steal it back for you,
if you like.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.045
Don't test my patience, mortal.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.731
My name is not "mortal."

54:30.120 --> 54:31.531
What is it, then?

54:31.840 --> 54:32.966
Bek.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.700
Very well, Bek.

54:35.800 --> 54:37.460
The roads will be watched now.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.244
Set will send better hunters.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.860
Well, that didn't go
according to plan, did it?

54:53.960 --> 54:55.980
No, Lord.

54:56.080 --> 54:59.140
My nephew did all this with one eye?

54:59.240 --> 55:02.687
- I underestimated his strength.
- Tough to kill, that boy.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.445
Like his uncle.

55:06.120 --> 55:09.020
Where's he going? Who's he allying with?

55:09.120 --> 55:12.620
- His only ally is the mortal.
- It's hardly an army, is it?

55:12.720 --> 55:14.060
I overheard them.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.766
The mortal spoke of a bargain
he'd made with Horus.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.580
This is one ambitious mortal.

55:19.680 --> 55:23.730
Horus has agreed to bring the mortal's
woman back from death.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.020
Are you sure?

55:26.120 --> 55:27.884
I'm certain of it, Lord.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.980
You should really get that attended to.

55:34.080 --> 55:37.368
- Yes, Lord. Thank you.
- Good job.

55:43.640 --> 55:46.420
You should have trusted us
with this from the start.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.761
Haven't we always left you satisfied?

55:50.760 --> 55:52.683
Then satisfy me again.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.365
Did you let your wife live?

56:04.480 --> 56:09.042
Sooner or later, you and I
will end up just the same.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.005
The Land of the Dead and its Nine Gates.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.780
Is it accurate, Mistress of the West?

56:26.880 --> 56:30.380
Don't call me that.
I left all that behind.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.847
Soon, I will rule all the world.

56:32.960 --> 56:36.780
The Land of the Dead
is the final kingdom left standing.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.769
You want things you can't have.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.660
- I want you to take me there.
- But you're a living soul.

56:43.760 --> 56:47.660
Yes. And you were a living soul, too,
when you were counselor to the dead.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.420
You know what's waiting
for me if I go back.

56:49.520 --> 56:53.500
You have your little bracelet
to protect you from those demons.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.170
It's not that.

56:55.920 --> 56:59.049
You miss it. Don't you?

56:59.840 --> 57:02.571
The darkness. What it brought out in you.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.140
No.

57:04.240 --> 57:08.131
You're not so good, Goddess of Love.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.580
- I know.
- Then do this.

57:11.680 --> 57:16.208
Prove your loyalty to me.
Then we can have everything.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.125
Together.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.285
Horus...

57:28.640 --> 57:30.210
My love.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.969
Horus...

57:43.840 --> 57:45.922
You're not in your father's tomb?

57:49.240 --> 57:51.129
I was wondering where he was.

57:52.080 --> 57:55.289
Now I know. Thanks.

57:57.440 --> 58:01.620
For someone who bends
the will of men by batting her lashes,

58:01.720 --> 58:03.165
you're not very clever.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.051
- How long has he had his sight?
- Why do you care?

58:10.880 --> 58:15.090
I'm yours now. I'll do as you've asked.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.488
Even if I kill Horus?

58:18.480 --> 58:20.300
Of course.

58:20.400 --> 58:22.767
Who cares about him?

58:25.120 --> 58:28.761
I'd have thought you'd be exhausted
from so much lying.

58:38.080 --> 58:42.130
I loved Nephthys once
and I took her wings.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.284
Imagine what I'll do to you.

58:46.760 --> 58:48.728
Do that and I'll hunt you down.

58:58.120 --> 58:59.645
Let me touch.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.968
I suppose it's better than running.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.930
Can we find a less unpleasant
campsite next time?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.321
This used to be a garden
like you've never seen.

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:15.925
What happened?

1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:19.340
It was my father's first temple.

1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:21.100
In his generosity, he opened the grounds

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:23.123
so the poor could bury their own here.

1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:26.886
Set has corrupted his teachings.

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:31.522
My father loved this place.

1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:35.042
So Set brought him here to be butchered.

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:40.300
His body was cut into 14 pieces.

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:41.780
The heart was never found.

1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:46.408
- Set salted the earth?
- No. It was my mother's tears.

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:49.409
Before she took her own life.

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.084
I failed them.

1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:56.100
I'm sorry.

1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:59.204
Ra told me I was on a journey.

1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:04.729
And if I reach the end,
I will be mighty again.

1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:08.644
- How does it end?
- With vengeance.

1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:13.127
Ends with my spear through Set's skull.

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:17.730
Is that a storm?

1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:20.483
There's no clouds.

1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:25.727
Set's hunters riding their pets.

1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:29.660
Those aren't pets. A cat is a pet.

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:32.060
I can't withstand their venom.
Not as I am now.

1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:33.580
Then I guess we should run.

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:36.206
- Run?
- Mortals do it all the time!

1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:54.964
- Run faster!
- I can't!

1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:01.844
- Run faster!
- I can't!

1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:14.760
Come on!

1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:28.300
- We have to kill them.
- "We"?

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:30.340
When you go fishing,
what's most important?

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:32.020
- I don't fish.
- It's the quality of the bait.

1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.980
- It's too dangerous.
- Are you worried about me?

1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:37.700
No, it's just my aim with a spear
is not what it was.

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.245
Then get closer before you throw it.

1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:50.606
Hey! Beautiful!

1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:54.409
I meant the snake!

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.940
That worked great. Let's go again.

1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:33.540
This time, the bait
needs to dangle longer.

1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:35.180
I must strike the weak spot from behind.

1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:36.580
And how do you know they have a weak spot?

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:38.100
I don't. But they must, right?

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:39.406
Go!

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:06.882
Excellent! You've made it angry.

1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:25.207
Too bad you can no longer fly.

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:33.764
Neither can you.

1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:09.006
You!

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.442
Just shut up and stay out of my way.

1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:20.128
Pretty girl, you don't belong in battle.

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:22.250
Burn her!

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:29.651
What a lovely creature you are.

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.249
Let me help you.

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:36.488
Burn her!

1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:40.526
You are so very cold.

1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:44.526
Warm yourself. I command you.

1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:54.966
Quickly.

1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:06.044
Your company was preferable.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:16.940
Outrageous!

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:18.500
You're welcome for saving your life.

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:20.060
So while I was sitting blind
in my father's tomb,

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:22.780
you shared a bed with the god
who pulled out my eyes.

1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:25.420
Why would I waste this
on someone who can't see?

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:27.180
Why would I ever trust you again?

1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:29.940
He's slaying all the gods
who won't bow to him.

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:31.724
That includes me.

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:35.220
We're breaking into Set's temple.
Horus is going to kill him.

1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:36.765
How were you planning to get in?

1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:38.740
Him?

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:40.524
He's seen the plans. He knows the way.

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:42.700
What about the Sphinx?
Have you forgotten about that?

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:46.540
- Sphinx?
- Set captured it to guard his fire.

1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:50.380
It will kill mercilessly all who enter
if they cannot answer its riddle.

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:51.780
You can answer the riddle, right?

1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:53.900
We shall ask Thoth for help.

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.380
Why would you ever do that on purpose?

1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:00.371
So we won't have to die any sooner
than is absolutely necessary. Let's go.

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.690
Did he give you that dress?

1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:16.380
I chose from what was provided.

1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:19.140
So you chose the one you thought
would please him the most.

1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:21.060
I dress to please myself.

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:23.100
Why? You don't like it?

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:25.060
It's too much.

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:27.620
I'm the Goddess of Too Much.

1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:31.122
And there's plenty I've given you
you've never found excessive.

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:34.660
Now it's maybe too little.

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.220
You never used to be so hard to please.

1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:38.890
You're slowing us down.

1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:45.420
I think it makes you look roguish.

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:47.260
What did I look like before?

1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:49.180
- Oblivious.
- Oh!

1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:51.760
- But in a cute way.
- Oblivious of what?

1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:54.940
Exactly. You always did
take me for granted.

1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:56.220
What?

1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:58.420
With your eye back,
you should have come to get me.

1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.363
- Oh?
- Don't I mean enough to you?

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:17.086
Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.660
Would it kill you to say "please"?

1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:24.660
I'm really not in the mood to argue.

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:29.926
Go get it for me. I command you.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.604
You're all the same, aren't you?

1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:35.404
What's her name?

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.820
I can make any man, woman,
god or beast do my bidding.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:42.082
Unless their heart belongs to another.

1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:44.204
You're in love.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.049
Her name's... Zaya.

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:54.929
I'm so sorry.

1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:04.860
I promised her a proper home.

1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:06.900
Money for a family. Respectability.

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.380
I gave her nothing.

1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:11.847
Oh, she wouldn't have been with you
if she didn't love you.

1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:14.540
- Believe me, I know.
- I'm going to make it up to her.

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:15.801
But I thought she...

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:18.620
- Horus is going to bring her back.
- He said that?

1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:20.220
I know it's hard to see past his

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:22.721
short temper and proclamations
of revenge but...

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:25.210
He's not so bad.

1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:27.290
It is hard to see.

1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:37.730
There it is.

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:10.006
Is that him?

1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:12.860
- Them?
- Of course not.

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.020
Then who are they?

1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:16.248
His trusted servants.

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:18.580
He only trusts himself.

1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:20.780
Rich with generous compost.

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:22.980
Colorful.

1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:25.820
Mainly in the green and red spectrums.

1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:30.660
Variegated varieties with inflorescences
composed of multiple florets,

1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:32.922
each with a modified calyx.

1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:36.220
Wise Lord of the Sacred Word,
we seek your counsel.

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:39.580
Once, a weed, uprooted and burned.

1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:45.020
Now prized for the vigor of its oils
and the sustenance of its leaves.

1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:47.600
But what is its truth?

1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:52.780
You! Turn around.

1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:54.780
You prefer the view from behind?

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:56.900
No, I... Well, yes.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.287
You know I can't lie. Turn.

1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:02.900
I'm not going to risk
looking at those tricky eyes of yours.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.300
- Forty-seven.
- Excuse me?

1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:06.940
The percentage of knowledge
I have so far recorded.

1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:08.420
I'm not even half done.

1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:09.900
Thoth, I only need...

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.740
The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.

1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:14.020
A child could deduce why you're here.

1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:17.500
Go ask the riddle
and come back and relay it to me.

1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:21.020
- I'll solve it.
- One of us would have to die.

1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:22.770
Well, draw lots.

1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:25.020
- Come with us.
- Ha!

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:27.327
One night. I'll give you one night.

1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:29.220
No, you won't.

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:31.820
Set must be stopped
before he destroys us all.

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.340
You see the wisdom in that, don't you?

1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:37.980
This is far too important to risk.

1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:40.420
I can recite the true names of the stars.

1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:41.580
I know.

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:43.460
I've seen the world created
from sand and water.

1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:44.820
Mmm-hmm.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.500
I contain all the wisdom in the universe.

1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:51.140
More precious than some crown.
Ha! I have it!

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:54.244
Its mystery. Its essence. Its truth.

1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.170
It's lettuce!

1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:59.220
Your father dropped his guard.

1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:01.660
That was not only extremely stupid,

1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:04.540
but now I'm forced to
write down everything I know

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:06.540
as a defense against
the remote possibility

1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:08.540
that Set's war finds me.

1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:13.460
I'm sorry that the corpses of my parents
have inconvenienced you.

1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:16.700
Apology accepted. Now, get out!

1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:19.087
But you have to help us!

1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:21.900
Careful.

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.446
I outnumber you.

1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:27.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:31.220
It's fine. I'll do it.

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:33.340
I thought you were a stray baboon.

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:35.820
I told you I'd be the one
to face the Sphinx.

1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:38.660
Your chance of failure is overwhelming.

1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.540
I'm sure. But before it kills me
I'm going to tell it that I asked

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.180
the God of Wisdom to come but he was
afraid he'd get the answer wrong.

1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:47.860
This is the cleverest strategy
you could devise?

1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:52.249
Playing on my ego?
How vain do you think I am?

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.531
Yes, well...

1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:02.681
Fine.

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:04.491
Fine!

1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:09.491
Let's go.

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:12.567
Bye.

1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:15.740
Well done.

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:16.921
Thank you.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:34.460
You know his Zaya can never come back.

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.300
The King doesn't have the power.

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:40.325
Anubis doesn't have the power.
You deceived him.

1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:43.900
He will probably die
trying to break into Set's pyramid.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.900
He offered his life.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.660
Because he thought he could save her.

1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:49.340
He believes what he wants to believe.

1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:52.380
You've been blind in more ways than one.

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:54.740
You really watched the world
come into being?

1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:56.080
I don't lie.

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:58.965
Where were you watching it from,
if nothing had been created yet?

1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:01.700
If I even attempted to explain,

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:05.088
your brain would liquefy
and run out of your ears.

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:09.380
I did not choose a path of revenge.
I chose none of this.

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:11.580
You tell me what kind of power
do I really have?

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:14.100
You have the power to make this right.

1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:16.220
He deserves to know the truth.

1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:20.020
I need him to get us in
to choke Set's fire.

1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:22.566
If he refuses, we'll all die.
Is that what you want?

1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:36.580
It's too dangerous to cross the plain.

1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:40.002
- We'll wait for darkness.
- But we're running out of time.

1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:42.691
- I say we cross now.
- And I say we wait.

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.050
All the time you were apart,
she never forgot you.

1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.140
You've always been in
Hathor's heart, you know.

1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:02.300
Yes, but she's got a big heart.

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:04.084
Room enough for a crowd in there.

1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:08.860
Tell me, oh, wise Lord of the Air.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:11.201
Why do you think Set let you live?

1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:17.580
She did it for love.
You'd punish her for that?

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:20.445
I didn't want her help.

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:24.131
I only ever wanted one thing.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:28.500
You know, I think everyone's a fool.

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:31.763
But you, My Lord, are bigger than most.

1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:50.169
Are you thinking about her?

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:54.563
Of course you are.

1:15:56.560 --> 1:15:59.860
I was once known
as the Mistress of the West.

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:04.140
My duty was to help dead souls
make their way to the Afterlife.

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.380
You traveled to the Land of the Dead?

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.404
I'm the Goddess of Love.
Even to those who have died.

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:13.580
I was young. Easily seduced.

1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:16.220
- "Seduced"?
- Demons.

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.300
This keeps them at bay.

1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:21.420
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.524
One for each of the demons
Horus slayed to free me.

1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:26.700
That's when I knew I loved him.

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:29.100
Zaya needs to know
you're fighting for her.

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.646
So she does not lose hope.

1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:38.051
Zaya.

1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:43.291
Zaya.

1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:48.966
Zaya? Zaya? Can you hear me?

1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:50.445
Zaya?

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.405
Who is it?

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.811
Who's there?

1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:58.060
- Hathor, Mistress of the West.
- Mistress.

1:16:58.160 --> 1:16:59.980
I speak to you
from the Land of the Living.

1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.380
Your beloved is with me.

1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:03.482
- Bek?
- Zaya, it's me.

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:06.769
I knew if there was a way,
you would find it.

1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:09.900
But I can't see you.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.367
Listen, we can be together again.
You can return.

1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:13.481
But how?

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.140
I'm helping Horus.

1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:17.740
In return, he's going to help us.

1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:19.580
It is really the Bek I love?

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:21.900
I know, Zaya. I can hardly
believe it myself.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.002
Bek, me, trusting the gods.

1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:26.045
But I was wrong, Zaya.

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:28.340
Horus is a just god,
as you said he would be.

1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:30.220
You're probably thinking,
"I told you so," right now.

1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:33.449
Well, yes. Just a little bit.

1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:35.860
It's so good to hear your voice.

1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:38.020
Everything's going
to be fine, Zaya, trust me.

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:39.980
Horus is going to bring you back.

1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:41.525
I know he will.

1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:44.011
Bek?

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:46.644
Bek, are you there?

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:52.562
It is forbidden for the dead
to speak with the living.

1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:55.281
Go.

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:19.980
There's a wheel inside.

1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:22.020
When you turn it, the sand stops moving.

1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:23.740
We just need to go through the door.

1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:25.380
Good thing you saw those plans.

1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:27.528
If you didn't know which one it was,

1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:29.483
this would truly be impossible.

1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:32.740
- Bek?
- Yes?

1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:35.320
You do know which is the door, right?

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:38.524
Yes, of course, it's... This one.

1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:41.450
No, no, it's... It's that one.

1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:43.963
No, no, it's this one!

1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:57.970
Roll the bones.

1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:43.660
You guessed?

1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:45.300
Well...

1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:48.740
I find your dependence
on chance troubling.

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:52.300
If you continue to survive,
I may need to study you further.

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:55.131
Now, which way to the Sphinx?

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:33.082
Trespassers in the House of the King,
answer my riddle or cease to be.

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:36.568
Go on. I'm waiting.

1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:41.040
I never was.

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:43.900
Am always to be.

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.380
No one ever saw me, nor ever will.

1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:51.260
And yet I am the confidence
of all who live and breathe.

1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:55.001
What am I?

1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:59.486
Order. You are Order.

1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:04.889
I never doubted you.

1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:11.768
Incorrect.

1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:15.410
Try again. Please.

1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:19.160
That was a completely suitable answer.

1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:22.682
You are Purity.

1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:31.620
Wrong again.

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:33.780
"What never was."

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:36.460
"Always to be."

1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:38.881
In the future. Non-existent. Imaginary.

1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:42.460
Yet...

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:45.260
Yet it exists and "never was."

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:48.140
- "Always to be."
- Thoth...

1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:50.460
Yet I'm the confidence
of all who live and breathe.

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:53.140
Mortals live and breathe!
Maybe stop thinking like a god.

1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:55.766
- Then I might as well stop thinking.
- Thoth!

1:21:56.440 --> 1:21:59.660
Wait, wait, I have it! You are Tomorrow.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:01.922
Oh, bother.

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.445
One drop.

1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:39.281
No!

1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:49.050
I should thank you.

1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:53.569
You lured him from his library
so that I didn't have to.

1:22:56.080 --> 1:22:57.620
The final piece.

1:22:57.720 --> 1:22:59.340
You coward.

1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:02.171
- Open this gate and fight me.
- Again?

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:05.163
Hasn't she seen you lose enough?

1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:10.482
Can't you allow me to spare you one last
moment of embarrassment before you die?

1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:12.641
Stop!

1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:15.764
Recognize this?

1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:21.130
Did he tell you he could bring
your woman back from death?

1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.370
It's not possible.

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.445
Not even for me.

1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:27.528
You expect me to believe you?

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:30.723
I don't have to lie.

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:34.966
How else would a blind,
useless god get you to help him?

1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:37.965
Go on.

1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:39.560
Ask him.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:43.568
- Pour it in.
- Is it true?

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:46.163
Bek, pour it in!

1:23:47.400 --> 1:23:48.731
No!

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:02.460
Shame you weren't on my side.

1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:05.620
I admire someone that doesn't
let death stand in his way.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:09.327
But this is what love gets you.

1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:14.740
It's quite fitting that you'll both
die together here in my house.

1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:18.447
I'll miss the conversation. And the rest.

1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:12.528
You denied me vengeance.

1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:17.084
Zaya thought you were
the greatest thing in all of creation.

1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:21.020
Every day, she prayed for you
to save Egypt, but you didn't come.

1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:24.966
- I was in a tomb. I didn't hear.
- No, you didn't listen.

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:27.487
All you care about
is your stupid vengeance.

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:31.047
I started to think I was wrong about you.

1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:33.940
But I've finally learned
the lesson of the gods.

1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:35.246
We don't matter to you.

1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:39.204
Well, now you know.

1:25:56.400 --> 1:25:58.641
Anubis, come forth.

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:07.060
Mistress.

1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:10.340
You are still as lovely as the first dawn.

1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:12.140
Hathor, what are you doing?

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:15.180
This mortal's beloved bears
no treasure for the scales.

1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:19.660
- Perhaps we can help her.
- You ask much, Mistress.

1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:23.740
It would require a very
special treasure indeed.

1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:26.380
- No. No. No!
- Like this?

1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:29.723
For you, Mistress of the West?

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:31.620
Yes.

1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:35.122
Grant him passage
to give it to her himself.

1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:41.007
- You will see her one last time.
- Thank you.

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:44.860
No, no, I forbid it.

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:47.140
We're both guilty of deceiving Bek.

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.940
- This will make amends.
- Not like this. Not with you.

1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:54.660
I command you to release me.

1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:58.526
You can't command me. You know why.

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:02.450
I'm the Goddess of Love.

1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:10.683
- If I don't do this, I'm nothing.
- I can't lose you again.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:49.046
Take it.

1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:02.768
Do what you need to do.

1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:23.208
The Hall of Two Truths.

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:26.881
Where we shall be judged.

1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:31.208
Step forward.

1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:47.001
What do you offer?

1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:56.449
Step forward.

1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:04.401
I shall live forever!

1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:10.522
What do you offer?

1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:22.963
Step forward.

1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.320
Step forward.

1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:54.122
What do you offer?

1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:58.361
What do you offer?

1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:08.607
Zaya.

1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:10.727
Bek.

1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:43.020
Set, receive the golden wings of Nephthys.

1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:46.488
May they protect him
from those who would harm.

1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:02.660
The karr of Thoth, God of Wisdom.

1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:05.047
Allow him knowledge of old.

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:16.364
The heart of Osiris.
Grant him dominion over all Lands.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:20.820
The all-seeing eye.

1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:24.891
Reward him so no enemy can deceive.

1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:43.402
You look glorious, Lord.

1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:48.080
I know.

1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:09.441
Father...

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:16.931
I noticed the tower. Impressive.

1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:19.220
I built it for you.

1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:22.060
If it were any taller,
it would be in my way.

1:32:22.160 --> 1:32:26.449
Turn your eyes from your sails
and look at everything I've done.

1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:30.500
What Osiris never could.

1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:32.648
I rule all that breathes.

1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:35.483
And all that is breathed upon.

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:38.940
None is mightier below the sun.

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.140
Then honor me as I've honored you.

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:44.004
If honor had been your intent,

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:47.060
you might have abstained
from murdering your brother.

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:50.100
So you do see everything down there.

1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:53.124
Tell me, Father, do you care what happens?

1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:58.540
I care more than you know.

1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:01.166
Then why was I cast out alone...

1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:04.720
...to walk on burning sand,

1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:09.969
while my brother played barefoot
by the shores of the Nile?

1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:18.540
Why did you make Osiris King?
And why did you give him a son?

1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:21.260
And yet you denied me
the chance to even give life.

1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:24.540
- This was your test.
- You didn't test him.

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:27.530
I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:32.580
And when the time came,
he didn't cling to his power.

1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:37.180
He gave it away freely.
He passed his test.

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:40.090
- And I'd wager I've passed mine.
- Not yet.

1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:42.650
It's true...

1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:44.930
I did not want you to have children.

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:49.620
This was a kindness,
because I did not want you to miss them

1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:51.100
as terribly as I have.

1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:52.486
Miss them?

1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:55.962
I need you to take my place.

1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:59.060
Here?

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:01.740
This is how your test ends, my son.

1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:04.286
There is no greater burden.

1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:07.810
But no greater honor.

1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:14.082
All you have done can be forgiven.

1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:25.740
You expect me to joust with this beast

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:29.580
night after night until I die?

1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:31.540
What do you want?

1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:33.449
Immortality.

1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:36.980
Immortality awaits us
all in the Afterlife.

1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:39.780
I don't want to die. I want to live.

1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:43.700
Forever.
Down there in the lands I conquered.

1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:47.180
My kingdom. This should be my reward.

1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:50.460
How? The only way to achieve
this is unthinkable.

1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:54.260
- One would need to devour...
- The Afterlife itself.

1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:56.740
You would unleash Chaos upon creation?

1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:58.860
You would destroy everything?

1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:04.260
Not destroy. Reshape it.
I will take your place.

1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:06.761
But it won't be sitting on some damn boat.

1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:32.682
No god could withstand that.

1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:36.361
I'm not just one god.

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:15.460
What do you offer?

1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:17.500
This will buy you
a place in the Afterlife.

1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:18.601
No.

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:21.040
Not without you.

1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:35.620
The gate has been broken! Chaos spreads.

1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:37.848
Apophis shall destroy this land.

1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:50.740
Horus is our only hope now.

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:52.340
He's not the god you think he is, Zaya.

1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:55.660
- He lied to me.
- Give him another chance.

1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:57.420
He only got this far because of you.

1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.660
My strength is not infinite.

1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:02.740
If the Lord of the Air
has any plan to rectify this,

1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:04.763
he should do so with haste.

1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:07.580
If you don't trust him, trust me.

1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:09.808
I know we'll be together again.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:24.460
Ra has fallen. Set has unleashed Chaos.

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:26.005
So how do we stop him?

1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:30.020
You never give up, do you?

1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:31.645
Only because Zaya told me not to.

1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:33.420
You didn't tell her about our bargain?

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:36.922
Yes, I did tell her. But for some
reason, she still believes in you.

1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:40.125
We must return to the capital.

1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:42.765
Then we have a long walk ahead of us.

1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:46.401
I prefer flying.

1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:51.281
Nephthys.

1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:54.168
Even beyond death,
she's trying to help us.

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:13.562
Come, demon!

1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:42.340
Set has Ra's spear.

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:45.420
He's drawing Apophis to the Nile,
to the source of all life.

1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:46.500
Why?

1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:49.020
To drink it. To destroy all creation.

1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:52.100
Ra isn't dead. And only he
can make this right.

1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:53.940
But he needs his spear.

1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:55.610
So how do we get it back?

1:38:56.440 --> 1:38:57.930
Maybe it's time we go fishing.

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:09.500
I come in your service,
I ask for your help.

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:10.886
Builder.

1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:14.450
We have need of you.

1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:36.060
It is the single greatest
architectural achievement

1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:37.605
that ever was and ever will be.

1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:40.085
My...

1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:45.140
I mean, Lord Set's obelisk

1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:51.202
stands exactly 2,220 cubits tall.
And not a rod off.

1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.620
Built from seven billion
blocks of granite,

1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:58.940
five billion slabs of Tura limestone,
and nine billion talents of gold.

1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:00.963
And the lives of how many slaves?

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:05.220
5,930.

1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:07.288
No, wait.

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:10.884
Make that 5,931.

1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:14.207
Don't! You need him to get to the roof.

1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:17.921
I'll see you up top.

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.321
You stood beside him
as if he were your friend.

1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:54.420
Oh, I know how it feels. Favor of a god.

1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:56.660
It's intoxicating.

1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:59.060
I'm sorry you picked
the wrong one to follow.

1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:00.620
He's improving.

1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:02.900
Your woman's still dead, isn't she?

1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.004
Shame. Such a pretty girl.

1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:09.328
Such lovely soft skin.

1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:15.684
Riches for the Afterlife.

1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:19.487
You see? I'm ready to die.

1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:12.961
Come, Apophis!

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:40.900
You should have stayed under the sand.

1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.940
I can understand killing for a crown,
but this is madness.

1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:46.660
Of course you don't understand.
How could you?

1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:49.206
Favored son of a favored son.

1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:40.180
By the way, Apophis is going to eat
the Land of the Dead.

1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:41.620
You'll never make it to the Afterlife now.

1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:42.801
What?

1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:52.489
Who picked the wrong god now?

1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.410
I think I may actually miss
our little get-togethers.

1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:34.609
But you're still no match for me.

1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:36.966
You're right.

1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:40.604
I'm just the bait.

1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:47.969
Now you're just becoming a pest.

1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:08.008
Horus!

1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:52.620
You don't think your eye might have been
more useful than a wounded thief?

1:45:52.720 --> 1:45:54.324
Probably, yes.

1:45:56.800 --> 1:45:58.768
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.

1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:03.364
- Including this.
- Accepted.

1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:36.260
I told you I'd steal your other eye.

1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:39.045
But you could have saved me some trouble
and told me you didn't need it.

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:42.260
Ra showed me the way, but I didn't listen.

1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.700
I believed I needed my eye to transform,

1:46:44.800 --> 1:46:48.486
but my journey isn't to seek
revenge at all costs.

1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:51.488
It is to protect my people.

1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:54.260
Stop congratulating yourself.

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:55.964
You've got more protecting to do.

1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.690
Behold, the new King.

1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:28.260
I thought you were
the greatest of all the gods.

1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:30.260
Now look at you.

1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.100
You have nothing.

1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:35.522
I am the greatest god.

1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:38.570
I spared you once. Huh?

1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:42.640
- I showed you mercy.
- I won't make that mistake.

1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.401
Grandfather, there's still time.

1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:10.122
Enough, beast!

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:29.366
Thank you.

1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:40.811
We make a good team.

1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:43.620
Are you sure you're not a god?

1:51:43.720 --> 1:51:45.848
What would I be the god of?

1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:48.925
Stupidity?

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:51.286
The Impossible.

1:51:56.240 --> 1:51:57.287
Bek?

1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:55.684
I have never been in debt.
And yet I am in debt to you, grandson.

1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:59.140
Ask whatever you will.

1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:01.340
Mountains will kneel before you.

1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:03.100
The winds will do your bidding.

1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:05.726
Answer quickly, for Apophis still hungers.

1:53:06.840 --> 1:53:08.922
And night is always coming.

1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:13.841
I want nothing.

1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:18.129
Except what's impossible for me to give.

1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:45.900
Am I...

1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:47.900
You've returned.

1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:49.684
Bek?

1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:51.006
You might want to help her.

1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:54.487
Zaya.

1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.180
Bek.

1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:02.566
Zaya?

1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:05.900
- I'm Horus.
- My Lord.

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.420
I thought this was impossible.

1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:10.444
Impossible? Yes.

1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:22.369
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:26.770
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:31.340
And so wisdom had been found.

1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:34.900
Tests had been passed.
Second chances given.

1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:38.527
To live again. To be whole again.

1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:41.340
Horus mourned his parents.

1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:43.740
They had long since passed
into the Afterlife.

1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:45.980
But he knew it was the wisdom of Ra

1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:49.289
that the Final Gate would
remain as it had always been.

1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:54.220
An unbreakable barrier between
this life and immortality.

1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:55.500
You think I'm ready?

1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:01.460
True readiness is a notoriously
difficult state to achieve.

1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:04.006
But you're close enough.

1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:19.620
Arise, Horus...

1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:22.690
King of all Egypt.

1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:36.965
From this moment on, the Afterlife
must be earned, not with gold,

1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:43.220
but by good deeds,
compassion, and generosity.

1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:47.769
What we do, how we act
in this life matters.

1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:57.204
Are you thinking about her?

1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:00.281
Of course, you are.

1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:06.921
You didn't think I'd misplace
Egypt's greatest treasure?

1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.900
You think they'd miss me
if I were gone a few days?

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.060
As Chief Advisor to the King,

1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:15.060
it's my duty to ensure they hardly notice.

1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:17.220
But if anyone asks...

1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:18.970
Tell them I had to go help a friend.

1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:24.807
I leave Egypt in your capable hands.
