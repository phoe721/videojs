WEBVTT

00:58.684 --> 01:00.234
I remember.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.363
I remember everything.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.904
Captain webb.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.066
Good morning.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.994
Has everything been explained to you?

01:14.449 --> 01:15.449
Yes, sir.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.657
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David webb.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.004
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.095
You knew exactly
what it meant for you

01:27.629 --> 01:29.379
if you chose to stay.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.638
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.930
You made yourself into who you are.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.595
Eventually you're gonna have to face the fact.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.806
You volunteered.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.851
Christian dassault made a reservation.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.305
Heather Lee.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.471
Ma'am,
we have a device

05:41.592 --> 05:44.552
issued to a stay-behind team
in novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.258
Marked on our inventory as destroyed.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.926
It's knocking on our front door.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.289
What's the status?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.512
Whoever it is, is just sitting there idle.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.757
There's no outbound traffic, nothing.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.138
Move.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.195
They've found a back door.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.983
We need the reverse shell.
I'm gonna locate the source.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.026
I'm working on it.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.162
Okay, people, we have a major breach
of our classified mainframe.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.237
Drop everything you're doing,
get on it right now!

07:13.851 --> 07:15.641
Ma'am, I'm sending you the shell.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.846
Got it.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.476
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.943
- Getting ip.
- Where's that traceroute?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.654
Unknown user. Monitoring.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.495
Reykjavik.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.528
Secops hacking camp.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.785
Kill the power to the building.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.408
Get into that power grid now.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.544
Yes, sir.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.127
I've got the power to the building.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.256
Stand by.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.927
Ten seconds.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.012
Let's get on top of this.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.846
- Shut it down.
- Copy that.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.061
Shutting it down.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.557
Dewey.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.937
We've just been hacked.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.519
How badly?

08:40.604 --> 08:42.234
Could be worse than snowden.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.440
Is there any attribution?

08:44.566 --> 08:45.646
We're working on it.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.954
Lee says it must be someone
with a deep knowledge of our systems.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.697
This could affect deep dream, and iron hand.

08:52.366 --> 08:57.576
I want a briefing
in my conference room in one hour.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.130
Yes.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.336
-Did you get confirmation?
-Yeah, there was a hack.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.303
So are we exposed?

09:14.346 --> 09:16.176
We don't know yet. We're checking.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.846
I want you to call Dewey. Set up a meet in DC.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.063
Aaron, we got a lot at stake here,

09:19.142 --> 09:21.482
-maybe we shouldn't rock the boat.
-Just do it.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.479
Hey, George. We ready for the launch?

10:33.342 --> 10:36.092
Heather, you know
the director of national intelligence?

10:36.178 --> 10:38.048
Heather Lee, cyber ops, sir.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.603
Have you got a name for us?

10:40.682 --> 10:43.062
The hacker was a former agency operative.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.399
Believed to be working
with Christian dassault,

10:46.438 --> 10:48.818
and previously linked to Jason bourne.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.570
Bourne?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.154
-Jesus Christ.
-What did they get?

10:54.696 --> 10:56.066
Black-ops files.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.784
From treadstone all the way to iron hand.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.406
Iron hand?

11:01.453 --> 11:04.543
But that's not even operational yet,
for Christ's sakes.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.331
Where is Nicky Parsons right now?

11:07.584 --> 11:09.044
On the move.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.586
She left Reykjavik,
traveling through Bucharest to Athens.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.630
Feels like a meet to me.

11:16.552 --> 11:17.762
Well, how are you going to handle it?

11:20.722 --> 11:22.932
We cut the head off this thing.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.689
Sir, I'd like to be point on this operation.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.742
You're not indoctrinated for this material.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.070
I'm already into it.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.995
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.372
When those files are opened, I can trace them.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.789
Let me in.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.712
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

11:49.793 --> 11:52.803
and, if he's out there,
I'll give you bourne, too.

12:00.804 --> 12:01.974
Excuse me.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.853
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

12:10.814 --> 12:15.284
but do not push your personal agenda
to the dni again.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.319
Understood.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.822
All right. I think you can help me.

12:20.324 --> 12:23.124
I'm going to give you
full operational control on this,

12:23.452 --> 12:25.082
and I will make sure you have access

12:25.162 --> 12:27.622
to any relevant teams and resources.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.254
And I want to know every move you make.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.710
Yes, sir.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.170
Thank you very much, sir.

13:01.865 --> 13:02.865
Yeah?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.663
I need your help, now.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.749
I'm not finished here.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.170
Jason bourne is in play.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.586
-Where?
-Athens.

13:14.670 --> 13:17.010
Close your account in Rome.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.166
Understood.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.789
Lee got a hit from a cctv feed.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.499
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago,
headed west across Athens.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.210
I got two local teams en route.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.628
-Any sign of bourne?
-Not so far.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.419
He's involved in this somehow. I can feel it.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.590
Upload all Athens data and feeds,

16:47.966 --> 16:49.836
and activate real-time processing.

16:49.968 --> 16:50.968
Copy that.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.306
Where are we?

16:55.224 --> 16:57.894
Parsons' bus has just arrived
at syntagma square.

16:58.352 --> 17:01.062
There's a demonstration
in front of the Greek parliament building.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.444
I think she'll use it as cover.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.110
Deploy Alpha and bravo to the square.

17:05.651 --> 17:08.241
Recon for Parsons
in the crowd outside parliament,

17:08.278 --> 17:10.238
and any possible rendezvous points.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.485
Copy that, sir.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.577
Sir, the asset has landed.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.439
Alpha team arriving now.

17:47.901 --> 17:48.901
Copy that.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.018
I have the Alpha team feeds.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.189
Pull them up.

18:47.252 --> 18:50.302
Athens police are reporting tactical teams
moving on the demonstrators.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.970
Isolate all social-media posts from the square.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.130
Yes, ma'am.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.787
Rewind Alpha one's feed.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.917
Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.130
All right, bravo two, four, moving in.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.725
What's wrong?

19:43.433 --> 19:44.483
I hacked the agency.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.062
For Christian dassault.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.404
I got all the black-ops files.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.114
We're putting them online.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.323
We need to move.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.612
Stop.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.031
Two seconds forward.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.528
Blonde hair.

20:03.996 --> 20:04.996
Enhance.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.422
Find her.

20:15.174 --> 20:18.554
Nicky Parsons sighted in
syntagma square. Redirect south on stadiou.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.635
I told you,
Christian dassault is going to get you killed.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.220
We don't have a choice, Jason.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.637
It's started again. A new program.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.477
Iron hand. It's even worse than before.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.191
What's that got to do with me?

20:29.271 --> 20:31.311
Because it matters. It matters.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.068
Not to me, it doesn't.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.940
All that matters is staying alive.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.447
You get off the grid, survive.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.817
I don't believe that and neither do you.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.835
Look at yourself.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.830
Look at what you're doing.

20:43.869 --> 20:46.409
You can't live like this for much longer.

20:48.498 --> 20:51.878
Jason, I came here
because I found something.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.250
I found your father's name
in the treadstone files.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.011
He was an analyst.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.799
He wasn't in operations.
He wasn't near any of that stuff.

20:58.842 --> 21:02.642
I'm telling you what I saw.
It looked like he was involved directly.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.510
And there's more.

21:04.598 --> 21:05.678
More about you.

21:05.724 --> 21:06.734
What do you mean?

21:07.309 --> 21:10.519
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.

21:10.646 --> 21:12.556
Watching me?

21:13.190 --> 21:15.400
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

21:16.485 --> 21:19.155
You torture yourself for what you've done.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.986
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.332
You need to read those files.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.420
Move. They tracked you.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.837
Alpha one has eyes on two targets.
One female, one male.

21:38.924 --> 21:39.924
Identify the male.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.178
Copy that, sir.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.468
Alpha one, we need an ID on the male target.

21:43.887 --> 21:47.387
We've got to get out of here
before the police cut off this part of the city.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.813
Head north.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.522
Meet me at the statue of Athena.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.283
I'll take them with me.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.333
That's him.

22:08.245 --> 22:09.255
Now.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.295
Stay with bourne.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.459
Clear to engage the target.

22:19.548 --> 22:20.588
Copy.

22:20.674 --> 22:22.934
Alpha team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.371
Come on.

23:24.947 --> 23:26.987
Sir, Alpha team comms are down.

23:27.074 --> 23:28.664
We've lost him, sir. He's taken them out.

23:30.494 --> 23:33.164
Find Parsons. He'll come back to get her.

23:33.247 --> 23:34.327
Sir, rioting is spreading.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.464
The Greek government
is declaring a state of emergency.

23:41.088 --> 23:43.168
Bravo team,
we are retargeting Parsons.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.896
We got her.

24:43.192 --> 24:44.902
Split the team, put her in a box.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.955
A suspect matching bourne's description
has stolen a police motorcycle.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.663
He's coming for Parsons.

26:12.698 --> 26:13.818
Where the hell is the asset?

26:13.866 --> 26:14.946
Two minutes out, sir.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.611
Parsons is at the statue of Athena.

26:49.693 --> 26:50.693
Copy that.

27:14.927 --> 27:16.427
Bravo team is down.

27:16.553 --> 27:18.393
Sir, the asset is arriving on scene.

27:18.472 --> 27:19.722
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.056
Give me the feed
and direct comms to the asset.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.188
Engaging targets.

27:47.751 --> 27:50.251
I'm accessing Athens
police tactical data.

27:50.379 --> 27:51.499
I need eyes overhead.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.258
Bring up the satellite suite.

27:53.298 --> 27:56.258
Sir, I'm showing a misty
and a kh-12 satellite available.

27:56.301 --> 27:58.091
-Light up the 12.
-Yes, sir.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.526
Satellite video feed is online.

28:16.238 --> 28:17.738
Police have blocked
the road to the north.

28:18.115 --> 28:20.285
The target will be forced to turn left.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.717
Another barricade in 200 meters.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.719
Target turning left again.

28:49.688 --> 28:50.898
Bourne's heading for the alley.

28:51.273 --> 28:52.693
Left at the top of the hill.

29:25.599 --> 29:26.599
Stairway.

29:26.683 --> 29:28.393
Up the hill. Heading east.

29:28.519 --> 29:30.019
Give me a strike point.

29:30.103 --> 29:31.603
He's found a way out.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.358
Two hundred meters to your left.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.860
19 solomou. Get to the roof.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.397
Target should pass within your line of sight.

29:38.487 --> 29:40.157
19 solomou. Copy.

29:48.455 --> 29:50.615
Focus the satellites on these coordinates.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.577
And give me a lock
on the motorcycle when it gets there.

29:52.709 --> 29:53.749
Copy that.

30:20.362 --> 30:22.662
I've got the targets.
They're approaching omonia from fidiou.

30:23.949 --> 30:25.279
Look west.

30:25.367 --> 30:26.527
The long boulevard.

30:27.119 --> 30:29.409
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.826
Copy that.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.405
The asset is online.

31:09.494 --> 31:11.124
Target's with you in 15 seconds.

31:19.630 --> 31:21.130
Five seconds.

31:28.013 --> 31:29.143
Contact.

31:29.181 --> 31:30.221
Stay low!

31:34.978 --> 31:36.308
Find a shot.

31:39.691 --> 31:40.731
Hold on!

31:57.209 --> 31:58.789
Targets are down.

32:18.689 --> 32:19.689
Where's bourne?

32:19.773 --> 32:21.153
Ma'am, a police helicopter spotted

32:21.191 --> 32:22.531
three bodies on the roof near the asset.

32:22.568 --> 32:24.318
A tactical team's on its way.

32:33.370 --> 32:34.410
Nicky?

32:48.260 --> 32:49.300
Don't move!

32:58.896 --> 33:00.976
Athens police have entered the building.

33:01.064 --> 33:03.734
Asset, you need to get out of there.

33:03.817 --> 33:05.067
Negative.

33:07.446 --> 33:09.446
We don't even know if bourne's alive.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.414
You want to lose this guy?

33:17.789 --> 33:18.869
This is director Dewey.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.627
You have 20 seconds.

33:25.964 --> 33:27.384
Hold on, Nicky.

33:28.467 --> 33:30.387
I'm going to get you to cover.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.800
No.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.390
No.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.356
No, don't.

33:46.818 --> 33:48.068
I'm coming.

34:46.128 --> 34:48.378
-Get a location on Christian dassault.
-Yes, sir.

34:48.505 --> 34:50.415
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,

34:50.507 --> 34:52.337
he will lead us to Jason bourne.

34:52.467 --> 34:55.007
And let me know if you get
a hit on that malware.

34:55.637 --> 34:57.177
Sir, can I clarify one thing?

34:57.973 --> 34:58.973
Yeah.

34:59.683 --> 35:01.693
Does the asset know bourne?

35:02.269 --> 35:04.269
Why would you ask me that?

35:04.354 --> 35:05.864
His behavior on the rooftop.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.940
It suggested a connection.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.200
The last time bourne came back,

35:12.279 --> 35:14.029
he exposed the blackbriar program.

35:14.781 --> 35:17.331
It compromised active operations.

35:17.701 --> 35:20.541
The asset was in Syria undercover.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.038
He was captured, tortured,

35:23.123 --> 35:26.383
and it took two damn years to get him out.

35:27.961 --> 35:30.551
So you think that's why
bourne wants the files?

35:30.631 --> 35:31.881
To go public again?

35:31.965 --> 35:33.625
I have no idea why he came back.

35:33.717 --> 35:35.677
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

35:35.719 --> 35:36.799
We can't let that happen.

35:38.514 --> 35:42.104
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.770
Yes, sir.

38:37.568 --> 38:40.738
And now,
the founder and chairman of deep dream,

38:40.821 --> 38:41.991
Aaron kalloor.

38:44.408 --> 38:45.408
Hi.

38:50.664 --> 38:51.664
Uh...

38:51.999 --> 38:53.079
You all know why we're here.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.925
We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.

38:55.002 --> 38:58.552
We think it is a bold new step
to allow us to serve our community better.

38:59.089 --> 39:02.429
We're a community right now
that is transcending national boundaries.

39:02.509 --> 39:05.429
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.

39:13.604 --> 39:16.654
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem

39:16.732 --> 39:19.532
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

39:19.610 --> 39:21.440
And what this new platform will do

39:21.486 --> 39:24.946
will be to integrate users' data
and preferences,

39:25.032 --> 39:27.122
and use that information

39:27.201 --> 39:31.161
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience

39:31.246 --> 39:33.616
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.580
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,

39:36.627 --> 39:38.957
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.

39:39.046 --> 39:41.376
This is a concern to many people,
and so it should be.

39:41.465 --> 39:43.055
I mean, this is something that matters to us.

39:43.133 --> 39:45.143
And let me just say, uh,

39:45.219 --> 39:48.099
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.313
So let me just tell you,

39:49.389 --> 39:52.309
when you come to deep dream,
when you use our service,

39:52.392 --> 39:54.142
no one will be watching you.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.657
- Mr. kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

40:23.465 --> 40:24.755
Enjoy your meal.

40:24.842 --> 40:25.972
Thank you.

40:28.345 --> 40:29.635
Congratulations.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.020
I hear your stockholders
were very happy with that new platform.

40:32.516 --> 40:34.516
And I heard you got hacked.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.809
We're dealing with it.

40:37.855 --> 40:40.985
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

40:41.525 --> 40:42.615
I'm out.

40:42.776 --> 40:43.986
Aaron,

40:45.320 --> 40:48.410
you are an extraordinarily gifted
and perceptive young man.

40:48.532 --> 40:49.992
When you agreed to help us,

40:50.033 --> 40:54.043
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...

41:01.837 --> 41:03.957
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm
I'll have on my hands

41:04.047 --> 41:06.217
if this arrangement becomes public?

41:07.259 --> 41:09.759
I already took a hit with snowden,
and you want more?

41:09.970 --> 41:12.720
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

41:12.973 --> 41:15.313
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.

41:15.392 --> 41:18.022
We need a back door into your new platform,

41:18.061 --> 41:19.771
and a way past the encryptions.

41:19.855 --> 41:22.195
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

41:23.233 --> 41:25.403
You don't get it, do you?

41:25.903 --> 41:28.863
Privacy is freedom.

41:28.906 --> 41:31.066
Maybe that's something
you should think about defending.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.415
You little prick,
you didn't believe in privacy or freedom

41:33.493 --> 41:36.083
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.673
I paid you back many, many, many times over.

41:39.082 --> 41:41.172
And I was never comfortable with any of this.

41:41.668 --> 41:42.878
I'm out.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.131
I'm done selling out our customers.

41:46.215 --> 41:47.925
But you would sell out your country.

41:49.176 --> 41:52.006
The truth is, we wouldn't be
having this conversation

41:52.095 --> 41:55.265
if you didn't feel personally at risk.

41:55.349 --> 41:56.809
You talk about a free Internet,

41:56.892 --> 41:58.732
you tell yourself you're saving the world,

41:58.769 --> 42:01.599
but all you're doing is making it
a much more dangerous place.

42:01.730 --> 42:03.940
And you're sure as hell making this country

42:03.982 --> 42:06.282
much more difficult to defend.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.950
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

42:12.449 --> 42:13.949
Accountable.

44:35.092 --> 44:36.432
Bourne?

44:36.593 --> 44:38.933
Everything on the table.

44:55.070 --> 44:56.240
Open it.

45:01.785 --> 45:02.945
Sure.

45:36.820 --> 45:37.900
Bourne has surfaced.

45:38.655 --> 45:39.655
In Berlin.

45:39.990 --> 45:41.240
Get the Berlin team up.

45:54.338 --> 45:55.588
Where is she?

45:55.923 --> 45:57.763
She's dead.

46:01.637 --> 46:02.637
She knew the risks.

46:04.264 --> 46:05.814
I warned her.

46:06.683 --> 46:08.233
She made a choice.

46:08.769 --> 46:10.809
You exploited her.

46:28.372 --> 46:29.542
Berlin team is mobile.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.416
What do we have on the location?

46:31.500 --> 46:33.250
It's an address linked to Christian dassault.

46:33.377 --> 46:34.417
Anything on bourne?

46:34.503 --> 46:37.673
Nothing yet. I'm accessing cctv now.

46:39.049 --> 46:42.719
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.890
What if he's not coming for us?

46:46.723 --> 46:48.063
What if it's something else?

46:50.227 --> 46:52.847
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

47:04.032 --> 47:05.412
We should work together, bourne.

47:06.660 --> 47:08.830
You exposed the blackbriar program.

47:10.455 --> 47:13.325
We're both after the same thing, right?

47:13.417 --> 47:17.247
We both want to take down
the corrupt institutions that control society.

47:18.547 --> 47:20.467
I'm not on your side.

47:37.524 --> 47:39.284
Cctv feed is online.

47:43.030 --> 47:44.610
He's on a computer.

47:44.698 --> 47:46.908
We have to stop this.

47:46.992 --> 47:48.242
If he puts those files online,

47:48.285 --> 47:50.045
operations will be compromised

47:50.120 --> 47:51.290
and people will die.

47:51.330 --> 47:52.580
Yes, sir.

47:57.753 --> 48:00.303
At least when you're done, leave me the files.

48:01.131 --> 48:03.551
These programs have to be exposed.

48:04.593 --> 48:06.513
People have a right to know.

48:23.403 --> 48:24.823
We need that computer.

48:30.827 --> 48:32.287
There's a phone in the room.

48:32.579 --> 48:33.999
I can use it to delete the files.

49:00.524 --> 49:02.284
-Got the phone.
-Where's that team?

49:02.442 --> 49:03.692
Five minutes out, sir.

49:03.861 --> 49:05.491
We're running out of time. Get there.

49:49.198 --> 49:50.658
Listen to me, David.

49:50.824 --> 49:52.414
I've done something.

49:53.285 --> 49:54.495
Something...

49:56.413 --> 49:58.123
...that came at a cost.

49:59.082 --> 50:01.252
One day you'll understand why.

50:02.961 --> 50:04.961
I gotta get back to Washington.

50:06.423 --> 50:07.883
I love you, son.

51:00.143 --> 51:01.563
They're fighting, sir.

51:13.490 --> 51:14.660
One more firewall.

51:40.184 --> 51:41.854
Files deleted, sir.

51:44.229 --> 51:45.399
Call in.

52:21.350 --> 52:23.140
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

52:23.852 --> 52:25.402
I'm not in charge here.

52:26.438 --> 52:28.728
I wasn't here when you went missing.

52:29.650 --> 52:33.450
I can see you're going through
the old treadstone files.

52:34.154 --> 52:35.744
Retracing your history.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.701
I know you're looking for something.

52:40.369 --> 52:42.749
Let me help you find it.

52:48.669 --> 52:49.749
Give me that phone.

52:55.092 --> 52:56.342
Yes, sir.

52:58.887 --> 53:01.347
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

53:02.850 --> 53:05.390
Jason, your dad was a patriot.

53:05.435 --> 53:08.015
He could see the threats
that America was facing,

53:08.105 --> 53:11.445
and, like you, he chose to serve his country

53:11.525 --> 53:14.035
out of a profound sense of duty.

53:15.362 --> 53:17.862
He would not want to
see you harm the agency.

53:18.031 --> 53:19.781
You have to stop this.

53:20.701 --> 53:22.541
And you have to stop it now.

53:27.082 --> 53:28.082
Sir, our eta is...

53:52.983 --> 53:54.573
He's on the move. Be ready.

54:09.124 --> 54:10.254
Take point!

54:10.334 --> 54:11.384
On me!

54:11.460 --> 54:12.840
The elevator.

55:00.968 --> 55:02.888
We lost him, sir.

55:19.194 --> 55:21.784
Malcolm Smith, contract only,
based out of London.

55:21.864 --> 55:23.874
Ran all of treadstone's surveillance
in the late '90s,

55:23.907 --> 55:24.987
when bourne was recruited.

55:25.409 --> 55:26.579
Is he still active?

55:26.660 --> 55:27.950
He's private security now.

55:28.036 --> 55:29.036
Contact the asset

55:29.079 --> 55:31.709
and tell him I want him on the ground
in London in six hours.

55:31.748 --> 55:33.538
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

55:37.254 --> 55:38.554
A mistake? Why?

55:38.589 --> 55:41.879
There is an argument for catching bourne
instead of killing him.

55:43.260 --> 55:44.930
All right, let's hear it.

55:45.053 --> 55:47.933
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

55:48.015 --> 55:50.525
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

55:50.684 --> 55:52.984
He knows things that could help us.

55:53.061 --> 55:56.021
Bringing him back in is the smart move.

55:56.190 --> 55:57.650
And how are we going to do that?

55:57.733 --> 56:00.743
Albert hirsch wrote a psych evaluation
when bourne left the program.

56:00.903 --> 56:03.613
He concluded bourne is still a patriot at heart,

56:03.697 --> 56:07.077
and that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.

56:08.994 --> 56:10.624
And what are you suggesting?

56:10.746 --> 56:13.036
I watched bourne with those files.

56:14.583 --> 56:16.253
Desperately looking into his past.

56:16.418 --> 56:19.588
And I think he's at a tipping point.

56:19.630 --> 56:22.300
If I could get face-to-face with him,

56:22.382 --> 56:24.012
I think I can bring him back in.

56:24.801 --> 56:25.931
One attempt.

56:25.969 --> 56:27.889
And if it fails,

56:28.472 --> 56:30.522
you do what you have to.

56:34.102 --> 56:36.772
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

56:38.941 --> 56:41.111
Let's give it a shot.

56:41.151 --> 56:42.151
All right, do it.

56:43.028 --> 56:45.608
Bring bourne in, or tie it off.

56:45.781 --> 56:46.821
But this ends now.

56:46.907 --> 56:48.027
Thank you, sir.

57:00.087 --> 57:01.127
Sir, I'm sorry...

57:01.255 --> 57:03.675
No, don't worry about that.

57:04.675 --> 57:07.015
Better get some sleep, kid.

57:08.303 --> 57:11.063
You got a long 24 hours ahead of you.

57:14.059 --> 57:15.189
Yes, sir.

57:29.491 --> 57:30.491
It's taking too long.

57:30.576 --> 57:32.536
It shouldn't still be buggy
this close to launch.

57:32.578 --> 57:33.578
Well, I don't think it's buggy.

57:33.662 --> 57:35.002
I think we've changed some things

57:35.038 --> 57:36.368
that's going to change the parameters.

57:36.415 --> 57:37.715
We're going to have to go and...

57:37.749 --> 57:39.079
Okay, well, we need to change them back.

57:39.168 --> 57:40.418
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?

57:40.502 --> 57:41.542
Absolutely.

57:41.628 --> 57:43.338
Look, I think you're right,

57:43.380 --> 57:45.840
-i just don't think we want to...
-I'm tired of waiting.

57:48.677 --> 57:50.047
Mr. kalloor.

57:50.095 --> 57:51.215
What the hell is this?

57:51.305 --> 57:53.185
Mr. kalloor, my name is John burroughs.

57:53.223 --> 57:54.893
I'm from the department of justice.

57:54.975 --> 57:57.065
I'm hereby serving you
with the enclosed complaint...

57:57.102 --> 57:59.482
-Really? We have to do this in public?
-Issued by the us government

57:59.563 --> 58:02.693
against deep dream corporation
for violation of the sherman act.

58:02.733 --> 58:04.863
This complaint requires you to preserve

58:04.902 --> 58:06.902
all personal and corporate financial records

58:06.945 --> 58:10.235
pending antitrust motions
to be filed in federal court.

58:10.324 --> 58:11.534
Good day.

58:23.128 --> 58:24.208
-This is Dewey.
-Aaron,

58:25.130 --> 58:26.630
it's a message.

58:26.757 --> 58:28.587
And maybe we should
think about what we're doing

58:28.634 --> 58:29.764
before it gets any worse.

58:29.885 --> 58:33.225
So, you think if we give him what he wants,
it'll end there?

58:33.263 --> 58:36.183
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.

58:37.476 --> 58:40.646
I want you to pull up all the records
of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.

58:41.230 --> 58:44.520
All the records?
Even the off-the-books discussions?

58:45.567 --> 58:46.777
Especially those.

58:49.947 --> 58:53.117
We're going to Vegas.
I need an insurance policy.

1:00:13.155 --> 1:00:14.165
Yeah.

1:00:15.157 --> 1:00:16.697
Are you in London?

1:00:16.742 --> 1:00:17.952
Yes.

1:00:18.869 --> 1:00:20.749
Why are you sending her?

1:00:21.455 --> 1:00:23.125
She serves a purpose.

1:00:24.208 --> 1:00:25.418
I work alone.

1:00:25.501 --> 1:00:26.921
Not this time.

1:00:27.753 --> 1:00:29.753
Don't make this personal.

1:00:30.672 --> 1:00:34.342
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.

1:00:34.384 --> 1:00:36.474
You know who you're dealing with.

1:00:36.970 --> 1:00:39.220
You better make sure you're ready.

1:00:48.565 --> 1:00:49.565
Yeah.

1:00:49.608 --> 1:00:52.358
There's something
you should know about deep dream.

1:00:52.402 --> 1:00:54.112
But I need an assurance

1:00:55.155 --> 1:00:56.905
that I have your support.

1:00:59.243 --> 1:01:01.333
You got it. What do you have?

1:01:02.037 --> 1:01:03.157
Kalloor

1:01:03.372 --> 1:01:06.042
is planning something for Vegas.

1:01:51.670 --> 1:01:52.670
Yes?

1:01:52.838 --> 1:01:54.208
This is Jason bourne.

1:01:55.007 --> 1:01:56.297
I need to talk.

1:01:57.509 --> 1:01:58.759
What about?

1:01:58.802 --> 1:02:00.472
I don't work for the agency anymore.

1:02:00.679 --> 1:02:03.389
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:33.960
Bourne just called Smith.

1:02:34.713 --> 1:02:36.263
They're meeting at Paddington Plaza.

1:02:36.423 --> 1:02:38.093
15 minutes.

1:02:38.175 --> 1:02:39.765
We'll tail Smith the whole way.

1:02:39.968 --> 1:02:43.008
As soon as we get eyes on bourne,
I'll approach him.

1:02:43.055 --> 1:02:44.395
Whatever you do, stay contained.

1:02:44.473 --> 1:02:47.523
I don't want the brits crawling all over us,
asking questions.

1:02:47.601 --> 1:02:48.981
Understood.

1:02:57.486 --> 1:02:58.696
Tracking device.

1:02:59.738 --> 1:03:01.488
You'll hold on the south side of the bridge.

1:03:02.950 --> 1:03:04.530
I'll contact you if I need you.

1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:06.290
Sure.

1:03:07.579 --> 1:03:08.579
You're the boss, right?

1:03:37.776 --> 1:03:40.396
Subject is on the move.
Heading toward the canal.

1:03:41.405 --> 1:03:43.325
Alpha team, take a parallel track.

1:03:43.740 --> 1:03:45.950
Bravo team, follow the subject from behind.

1:03:46.034 --> 1:03:47.664
And keep your eyes open for bourne.

1:03:48.203 --> 1:03:50.083
Bravo team tailing subject.

1:03:58.922 --> 1:04:00.052
Let's go.

1:04:00.132 --> 1:04:01.932
In 200 meters, make a right.

1:04:02.009 --> 1:04:03.339
Copy that.

1:04:09.349 --> 1:04:12.139
Comms check. Second channel. Do you copy?

1:04:12.936 --> 1:04:14.396
I have you. Where are you now?

1:04:14.438 --> 1:04:15.608
Heading towards Smith.

1:04:17.441 --> 1:04:18.571
No sign of bourne.

1:05:00.734 --> 1:05:02.244
Subject has turned east,

1:05:02.319 --> 1:05:03.319
into an alley.

1:05:03.403 --> 1:05:04.403
Alpha team,

1:05:04.488 --> 1:05:06.908
that alley leads to a footbridge,
which will bring him to you.

1:05:07.366 --> 1:05:08.366
Copy that.

1:05:20.879 --> 1:05:22.339
Bravo team is down.

1:05:22.464 --> 1:05:23.594
Sending you updated route now.

1:05:25.759 --> 1:05:27.219
You copy that, Smith?

1:05:29.638 --> 1:05:30.638
Yes.

1:05:48.907 --> 1:05:51.907
Bravo team, why aren't you moving?
What's going on?

1:05:53.954 --> 1:05:55.464
Bravo team, do you copy?

1:05:56.498 --> 1:05:58.328
What's happening, Heather? Where's bravo?

1:05:58.834 --> 1:06:00.384
We're comms down on bravo.

1:06:00.586 --> 1:06:02.586
Alpha team, do you have
eyes on the subject?

1:06:07.801 --> 1:06:08.971
We have eyes on.

1:06:15.559 --> 1:06:17.439
Alpha team, sit-rep.

1:06:22.649 --> 1:06:24.229
Alpha team, report.

1:06:24.318 --> 1:06:25.818
What's happening, Heather?

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:28.660
Alpha team isn't responding.

1:06:28.739 --> 1:06:30.319
Bravo?

1:06:30.407 --> 1:06:31.617
Still nothing.

1:06:31.700 --> 1:06:33.910
You lost both teams?
Get a grip on this operation, Heather.

1:06:34.036 --> 1:06:35.036
That's bourne.

1:06:35.495 --> 1:06:36.905
Green-light the asset.

1:06:37.789 --> 1:06:39.249
Sir, I need more time.

1:06:39.333 --> 1:06:40.543
We have no time.

1:06:41.043 --> 1:06:43.093
Are you going to give that order or not?

1:06:43.128 --> 1:06:44.548
Sir, please.

1:06:44.588 --> 1:06:46.508
You are too naive to see the truth.

1:06:46.590 --> 1:06:49.130
There's no bringing in bourne.

1:06:49.218 --> 1:06:50.888
He has to be put down,

1:06:50.969 --> 1:06:53.049
and you obviously cannot do
what has to be done.

1:06:53.263 --> 1:06:55.353
I am taking operational control.

1:06:56.725 --> 1:06:58.475
Asset, you have a green light.

1:06:58.644 --> 1:07:01.484
Repeat, you have a green light on bourne.

1:07:01.563 --> 1:07:02.613
Copy that.

1:07:02.731 --> 1:07:04.111
I'm on my way.

1:07:12.199 --> 1:07:14.119
Asset, are you on the move?

1:07:16.578 --> 1:07:18.908
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

1:07:19.706 --> 1:07:21.036
Are you moving?

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:23.924
Heather, stay off this channel.
Let him do his job.

1:07:27.631 --> 1:07:28.631
Left here.

1:07:28.882 --> 1:07:31.472
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.

1:08:14.261 --> 1:08:15.511
In position.

1:08:25.439 --> 1:08:26.649
Locked in.

1:08:45.751 --> 1:08:46.751
What's going on?

1:08:47.002 --> 1:08:48.092
What's that noise?

1:08:49.379 --> 1:08:51.129
Multiple fire alarms.

1:08:51.298 --> 1:08:52.718
That's bourne.

1:08:56.595 --> 1:08:57.855
What do I do?

1:08:59.139 --> 1:09:01.059
You stay there. You do not move.

1:09:08.815 --> 1:09:11.525
Leave the building
by the nearest available exit.

1:09:13.195 --> 1:09:14.285
I can't stay here.

1:09:14.655 --> 1:09:16.075
You can't protect me.

1:09:16.114 --> 1:09:17.914
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

1:09:18.450 --> 1:09:19.620
You still have line of sight?

1:09:21.912 --> 1:09:23.122
I'm on him.

1:09:23.288 --> 1:09:24.458
You're gonna shoot him

1:09:24.623 --> 1:09:26.673
in a crowd when he's right next to me?

1:09:26.917 --> 1:09:28.417
Stay where you are, Smith.

1:09:28.752 --> 1:09:30.462
You know why he's here.

1:09:30.546 --> 1:09:31.706
He wants answers.

1:09:31.964 --> 1:09:33.054
You've lost this thing.

1:09:33.966 --> 1:09:35.046
I gotta get out of here.

1:09:42.516 --> 1:09:43.846
Shit!

1:09:52.901 --> 1:09:54.241
What the hell is going on?

1:09:54.403 --> 1:09:56.153
Bourne's got Smith.

1:10:14.882 --> 1:10:17.382
Go after them.
I'll come around and cut them off.

1:10:23.348 --> 1:10:24.518
Smith, we know you're with bourne.

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:26.390
You have to find a way
to let us know where you are.

1:10:29.771 --> 1:10:31.521
Why are you taking me in here?

1:10:31.732 --> 1:10:33.112
They've got to be near the Plaza.

1:10:38.822 --> 1:10:40.202
Jesus, bourne!

1:10:40.324 --> 1:10:41.324
God damn it!

1:10:43.535 --> 1:10:45.445
What are you doing? Take it easy.

1:10:45.495 --> 1:10:46.655
Richard webb.

1:10:46.747 --> 1:10:48.537
Station chief, Beirut.

1:10:48.624 --> 1:10:51.334
He was my father. He started treadstone.

1:10:51.376 --> 1:10:53.666
He hired you to put me
under surveillance. Why?

1:10:53.754 --> 1:10:55.514
-Jesus!
-Why did he hire you?

1:10:55.631 --> 1:10:57.011
Don't say anything, Smith.

1:10:57.216 --> 1:10:58.676
No. No.

1:11:05.933 --> 1:11:06.933
There's no sign of them.

1:11:07.476 --> 1:11:08.556
What do you want us to do?

1:11:08.685 --> 1:11:10.345
Work your way down the canal.

1:11:10.395 --> 1:11:12.265
I'll circle around and meet you there.

1:11:16.568 --> 1:11:18.858
You followed me to Beirut.

1:11:18.904 --> 1:11:21.204
The last time I saw my father!

1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:22.570
Why would he have you follow me?

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:24.990
It doesn't make any sense. Why?

1:11:25.202 --> 1:11:27.292
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

1:11:27.871 --> 1:11:28.961
Why?

1:11:37.756 --> 1:11:39.586
Jesus Christ, bourne! I'm falling!

1:11:39.967 --> 1:11:41.547
Bourne, please!

1:11:41.593 --> 1:11:43.433
I can hear them!

1:11:43.512 --> 1:11:44.602
Beirut.

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:47.890
I went there to tell him
that treadstone had approached me.

1:11:48.225 --> 1:11:49.315
But if it was his program,

1:11:49.393 --> 1:11:51.313
why didn't he say anything to me?

1:11:52.396 --> 1:11:53.896
I've done something.

1:11:54.690 --> 1:11:56.070
Something...

1:11:57.776 --> 1:11:59.146
...that came at a cost.

1:12:03.615 --> 1:12:05.195
That was the day he was killed.

1:12:06.034 --> 1:12:07.914
They said he was killed by terrorists.

1:12:08.370 --> 1:12:10.750
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

1:12:10.789 --> 1:12:13.829
Think about your family's safety, Smith.
You keep your mouth shut.

1:12:14.626 --> 1:12:16.336
The next bullet's in your head!

1:12:17.212 --> 1:12:18.592
Why was he killed?

1:12:19.506 --> 1:12:20.506
Why?

1:12:22.092 --> 1:12:23.932
He was killed because of you.

1:12:27.306 --> 1:12:30.176
Your father, he wasn't in operations.

1:12:30.601 --> 1:12:32.771
He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...

1:12:33.604 --> 1:12:35.774
He threatened to expose the program.

1:12:35.856 --> 1:12:38.436
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

1:12:46.450 --> 1:12:47.620
Who killed him?

1:12:56.627 --> 1:12:57.787
Who killed him?

1:12:57.878 --> 1:12:59.208
Don't do it.

1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:00.880
Where is he?

1:13:03.008 --> 1:13:04.378
He's almost there.

1:13:08.430 --> 1:13:10.680
We're gonna stop this now.

1:13:12.142 --> 1:13:13.482
No, please.

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:33.040
Somebody help! Call an ambulance!

1:13:34.122 --> 1:13:35.122
Someone help!

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:38.083
He went off the roof. Five floors.

1:13:38.335 --> 1:13:39.835
He recognized me.

1:13:40.254 --> 1:13:42.344
I'm going to make sure it's finished.

1:13:47.761 --> 1:13:49.511
Help's coming now.

1:13:49.555 --> 1:13:50.765
No, don't get up, mate.

1:13:55.394 --> 1:13:56.854
Step aside, please. Step aside.

1:13:57.521 --> 1:13:58.861
Everybody step back.

1:13:58.939 --> 1:14:00.689
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.

1:14:02.901 --> 1:14:04.031
Did anybody see what happened?

1:14:04.111 --> 1:14:05.151
He's gone.

1:14:05.195 --> 1:14:07.155
-Oh, shit.
-I'm going after him.

1:14:07.197 --> 1:14:08.817
I'll work my way down the canal.

1:14:10.742 --> 1:14:12.872
No. You're done in London.

1:14:12.911 --> 1:14:14.371
What are you talking about?

1:14:14.454 --> 1:14:16.044
There's another play to be made.

1:14:16.707 --> 1:14:19.207
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us,

1:14:19.293 --> 1:14:22.133
and that could be the opportunity
for something else.

1:14:22.713 --> 1:14:24.013
This isn't about revenge.

1:14:24.047 --> 1:14:25.217
Yes, it is.

1:14:25.841 --> 1:14:28.051
And it won't be done until one of us is dead.

1:14:28.886 --> 1:14:30.886
Get to the airport.

1:14:30.929 --> 1:14:33.099
We have a problem with iron hand.

1:14:35.058 --> 1:14:36.228
Copy that.

1:14:44.735 --> 1:14:46.035
Give me a sit-rep.

1:14:46.069 --> 1:14:47.609
We've got nothing.

1:14:47.696 --> 1:14:48.986
Keep looking.

1:14:55.954 --> 1:14:57.334
Drive.

1:15:02.753 --> 1:15:04.053
It wasn't supposed to go like this.

1:15:04.087 --> 1:15:05.167
I wanted to talk.

1:15:05.255 --> 1:15:06.915
Where's Dewey going?

1:15:10.886 --> 1:15:12.096
He's going to Vegas

1:15:12.137 --> 1:15:14.847
to speak with Aaron kalloor
at a cyber convention.

1:15:14.932 --> 1:15:17.682
The agency recruits there every year.

1:15:17.768 --> 1:15:19.098
What's iron hand?

1:15:21.772 --> 1:15:23.062
Dewey's new black-ops program.

1:15:24.233 --> 1:15:26.283
Full-spectrum surveillance.

1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:28.950
Watching everyone all the time.

1:15:29.029 --> 1:15:31.869
Dewey needs kalloor's cooperation
to bring it online.

1:15:34.576 --> 1:15:35.576
Let me out.

1:15:37.913 --> 1:15:38.963
I can help you get there.

1:15:43.502 --> 1:15:44.632
Why would you do that?

1:15:44.753 --> 1:15:46.343
You and I have different reasons,

1:15:46.421 --> 1:15:48.381
but we both want Dewey gone.

1:15:52.845 --> 1:15:53.895
Here, take this.

1:16:08.443 --> 1:16:09.993
I'll see you in Vegas.

1:16:35.179 --> 1:16:36.599
Sir.

1:16:37.306 --> 1:16:40.016
We're pinning kalloor's hit
on a fictional jihadi shooter.

1:16:40.100 --> 1:16:42.100
A 20-year-old Iraqi national.

1:16:42.269 --> 1:16:45.359
We created bank accounts,
travel documents, e-mails, phone records.

1:16:46.356 --> 1:16:47.516
He'll look like a lone wolf.

1:16:47.608 --> 1:16:48.778
Any physical evidence?

1:16:48.942 --> 1:16:52.072
The asset leaves the gun.
It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.

1:16:53.697 --> 1:16:55.907
Russell doesn't need to know about this.

1:16:58.535 --> 1:17:00.035
I understand, sir.

1:17:01.038 --> 1:17:02.708
Any news on bourne?

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:04.080
Nothing.

1:17:06.126 --> 1:17:08.206
He was always gonna come for me.

1:17:10.923 --> 1:17:12.923
Well, if it happens, we'll deal with it.

1:17:50.045 --> 1:17:52.705
What was the purpose of your visit
to London, Mr. Michaels?

1:17:53.882 --> 1:17:55.382
Business.

1:18:20.617 --> 1:18:21.867
Welcome home, sir.

1:18:23.453 --> 1:18:24.453
Thank you.

1:18:39.928 --> 1:18:41.678
Parking lot clear. You're good to go.

1:18:46.143 --> 1:18:47.893
Sir, we have a secure room for you,
right upstairs.

1:19:49.039 --> 1:19:50.539
-Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

1:19:52.042 --> 1:19:53.502
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

1:19:53.669 --> 1:19:55.799
-Heather Lee, checking in.
-Okay.

1:20:02.177 --> 1:20:04.887
We have you in a lovely sky suite.
Number 2016.

1:20:05.722 --> 1:20:06.812
Enjoy your stay.

1:20:06.890 --> 1:20:07.890
Thank you.

1:20:15.899 --> 1:20:17.479
Aaron!

1:20:20.237 --> 1:20:21.487
All right, Aaron!

1:20:21.572 --> 1:20:22.742
Deep dream!

1:20:34.585 --> 1:20:36.545
Find Lee.

1:20:36.587 --> 1:20:38.797
Tell her I want to see her
before we go on stage.

1:20:38.922 --> 1:20:40.262
Yes, sir.

1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:42.680
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.

1:20:42.759 --> 1:20:43.889
Yes, sir.

1:20:53.770 --> 1:20:55.690
Coming through, make a hole.

1:20:55.772 --> 1:20:57.902
Make a hole, make a hole.

1:20:58.942 --> 1:21:00.322
Gonna make a quick stop here.

1:21:00.402 --> 1:21:03.032
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going? Aaron.

1:21:03.113 --> 1:21:04.203
Good to meet you.

1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:05.870
Can I get one?

1:21:08.368 --> 1:21:09.788
Thanks very much for your hard work.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:14.120
Thank you.

1:21:14.208 --> 1:21:15.208
You're doing a great job.

1:21:47.491 --> 1:21:48.491
Yeah.

1:21:48.742 --> 1:21:50.122
You all set?

1:21:50.285 --> 1:21:52.325
Checking the departure route now.

1:21:52.412 --> 1:21:54.332
You won't have much time.

1:21:54.748 --> 1:21:57.998
They won't know where it came from.
I'll have enough time.

1:21:59.294 --> 1:22:00.634
After you take care of kalloor,

1:22:00.671 --> 1:22:02.131
I'll be standing, left hand at my side.

1:22:02.172 --> 1:22:03.212
You put a bullet in it.

1:22:03.340 --> 1:22:05.380
It's better if I'm a target, too.

1:22:06.510 --> 1:22:07.720
Copy that.

1:22:47.384 --> 1:22:48.394
Lee.

1:22:51.054 --> 1:22:53.064
The director wants a word
before you go on stage.

1:22:54.558 --> 1:22:55.848
Of course.

1:23:18.582 --> 1:23:19.582
ID?

1:23:20.167 --> 1:23:21.167
Thanks.

1:23:45.275 --> 1:23:46.275
Ah.

1:23:46.527 --> 1:23:47.527
Heather.

1:23:48.779 --> 1:23:51.409
My protégée. Strongest supporter.

1:23:52.115 --> 1:23:53.775
You know, after what happened in London,

1:23:53.825 --> 1:23:55.405
I did not know what to do with you.

1:23:55.452 --> 1:23:57.832
I suppose we'll just, um,

1:23:57.913 --> 1:24:00.423
write it off to your learning curve.

1:24:01.124 --> 1:24:02.544
I'd appreciate that.

1:24:03.794 --> 1:24:06.634
At least you can
now see that you never had a chance.

1:24:07.256 --> 1:24:10.086
When bourne turns up again,
I'll deal with him.

1:24:10.133 --> 1:24:11.723
Do you understand?

1:24:11.802 --> 1:24:13.432
Of course.

1:24:13.470 --> 1:24:15.100
I agree completely.

1:24:17.975 --> 1:24:19.525
When we get on stage,

1:24:19.643 --> 1:24:22.483
I'll handle all the policy questions,
throw everything technical to you.

1:24:22.563 --> 1:24:23.653
I'll be ready, sir.

1:24:23.730 --> 1:24:25.320
Okay, let's do this.

1:24:35.909 --> 1:24:37.159
Badges?

1:24:54.344 --> 1:24:55.394
Aaron.

1:24:56.346 --> 1:24:57.346
Robert.

1:24:59.183 --> 1:25:00.813
You know Heather Lee.

1:25:04.605 --> 1:25:06.905
Yeah, we went to Stanford together.

1:25:07.566 --> 1:25:10.146
Wow. How are you enjoying
life at the agency?

1:25:10.402 --> 1:25:12.992
Challenging. But fulfilling.

1:25:13.822 --> 1:25:16.702
It's tough to stay true
to your principles over there?

1:25:17.201 --> 1:25:19.491
My principles are just fine, thanks.

1:25:20.871 --> 1:25:23.211
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.

1:25:23.290 --> 1:25:24.290
I'm going to enjoy this.

1:25:25.626 --> 1:25:27.166
So am I.

1:25:40.724 --> 1:25:42.234
Thank you, sir.

1:26:03.413 --> 1:26:05.173
Oh! Hi! How's everybody doing tonight?

1:26:06.708 --> 1:26:08.208
Welcome.

1:26:10.754 --> 1:26:12.094
Welcome.

1:26:13.590 --> 1:26:17.220
Welcome to tonight's exocon symposium.

1:26:17.594 --> 1:26:21.474
We are so lucky to have
four fantastic guests this evening.

1:26:22.099 --> 1:26:24.889
The CIA director, Robert Dewey, is here.

1:26:27.604 --> 1:26:31.194
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of exocon,

1:26:31.275 --> 1:26:35.995
the ceo of social-media giant deep dream,
Aaron kalloor is here.

1:27:09.271 --> 1:27:13.021
Tonight, "policing a free Internet,

1:27:13.901 --> 1:27:16.821
"personal rights versus public safety."

1:27:17.154 --> 1:27:19.664
This is the great question of our time.

1:27:19.698 --> 1:27:22.528
And the choices we make about this
will determine our future.

1:27:23.285 --> 1:27:25.335
So let's just dive right in, okay?

1:27:27.623 --> 1:27:29.043
Come on out here, guys.

1:27:29.499 --> 1:27:31.879
Sir, you've got an incoming message.

1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:32.960
High priority.

1:27:34.171 --> 1:27:35.841
All right, guys, I'm gonna have to take this.

1:27:35.881 --> 1:27:38.011
I'll catch up with you later.

1:27:38.091 --> 1:27:39.131
Go ahead.

1:27:47.142 --> 1:27:48.852
Thanks for having me. Hey.

1:27:59.530 --> 1:28:01.950
It appears director Dewey
is held up momentarily,

1:28:02.032 --> 1:28:05.542
and I am being told
that it shouldn't be too much longer.

1:28:05.661 --> 1:28:07.251
But we have a ton of stuff to get into tonight,

1:28:07.329 --> 1:28:08.619
- so we can start anyway...
- Brad?

1:28:08.705 --> 1:28:10.325
Brad, could I say a few words?

1:28:10.791 --> 1:28:12.501
-Excuse me?
-Can I get the ball rolling?

1:28:12.668 --> 1:28:14.168
Oh, sure, man, by all means.

1:28:14.211 --> 1:28:16.341
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron kalloor.

1:28:27.891 --> 1:28:28.931
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1:28:30.227 --> 1:28:32.557
Thanks a lot to Brad
and all the folks at exocon

1:28:32.646 --> 1:28:34.226
for having us back,

1:28:34.314 --> 1:28:36.194
and to you guys for turning out.

1:28:37.234 --> 1:28:39.824
Before the director comes out to join us,

1:28:39.903 --> 1:28:42.573
I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.

1:28:42.865 --> 1:28:45.245
A long time ago, I had this idea.

1:28:45.659 --> 1:28:48.239
-Copy that.
-A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...

1:28:48.328 --> 1:28:49.748
Facial recognition got a hit.

1:28:49.830 --> 1:28:51.920
Bourne was on a ba flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

1:28:51.957 --> 1:28:53.457
It landed two hours ago.

1:28:54.501 --> 1:28:56.631
How the hell did he get through immigration?

1:28:56.712 --> 1:28:59.512
Someone issued him an agency
security clearance on his passport.

1:29:01.675 --> 1:29:03.585
Well, it turned out
to be a pretty popular idea.

1:29:03.677 --> 1:29:04.927
Um...

1:29:05.095 --> 1:29:07.505
People from around the world
started using our service.

1:29:19.818 --> 1:29:20.818
Well, first off,

1:29:21.195 --> 1:29:23.955
this has all made me a lot more rich
than is probably healthy.

1:29:24.072 --> 1:29:28.122
When I come on stage,
take care of kalloor and the girl.

1:29:28.785 --> 1:29:30.405
Copy.

1:29:30.537 --> 1:29:32.037
But, what I mean
to say is that, you know,

1:29:32.122 --> 1:29:34.122
all this success has come at a cost.

1:29:34.875 --> 1:29:38.095
There is a cancer at the heart of deep dream.

1:29:40.005 --> 1:29:41.085
A guilty secret, and, um...

1:29:43.217 --> 1:29:44.797
I have to share it with all of you guys.

1:29:44.843 --> 1:29:46.223
Son of a bitch is about to take us down.

1:29:46.303 --> 1:29:47.643
Take out kalloor and the girl right now.

1:29:52.726 --> 1:29:53.766
Whoa, whoa...

1:29:53.810 --> 1:29:55.480
-Stay there.
-Okay.

1:29:56.813 --> 1:29:58.983
When I was starting out, I, uh...

1:29:59.983 --> 1:30:02.323
I took money to start my company.

1:30:04.988 --> 1:30:06.908
Made a bargain with a guy in a dark suit...

1:30:10.118 --> 1:30:12.408
...and now he's come back to take my soul.

1:30:21.463 --> 1:30:22.463
I see the shooter!

1:30:22.506 --> 1:30:23.586
We've got eyes on Jason bourne.

1:30:24.675 --> 1:30:26.185
He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance!

1:30:26.343 --> 1:30:27.343
Go, go!

1:30:28.637 --> 1:30:30.507
- Let's go!
- Sir, we gotta go.

1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:44.820
Head for the exit!

1:30:47.948 --> 1:30:49.698
This is vasquez. We're on bourne.

1:30:49.867 --> 1:30:51.027
Get the cars ready!

1:30:51.368 --> 1:30:53.328
Get the cars ready right now!

1:30:53.495 --> 1:30:54.825
No, take me to the suite.

1:30:54.872 --> 1:30:57.122
Sir, we've got to get you out of here.
Bourne is on the loose.

1:30:57.207 --> 1:31:00.417
You heard me. Take me to the suite.

1:31:00.502 --> 1:31:01.542
Yes, sir.

1:31:01.628 --> 1:31:03.628
Take him to the suite. Take him upstairs.

1:31:03.714 --> 1:31:04.764
Get him upstairs.

1:31:04.882 --> 1:31:05.882
Right now. Right now.

1:31:06.216 --> 1:31:07.216
Up to the suite.

1:31:07.885 --> 1:31:09.555
-Let's go, right now. Go, go, go!
-Yes, sir.

1:31:09.595 --> 1:31:13.105
Come this way.
This way. Don't worry. Come on.

1:31:17.769 --> 1:31:19.559
Out of the way! Federal agent!

1:31:27.738 --> 1:31:29.528
Vasquez, sit-rep.

1:31:29.948 --> 1:31:31.278
Vasquez, come in!

1:31:34.077 --> 1:31:35.077
Hey!

1:31:53.722 --> 1:31:55.852
Okay, we've got him.
Sir, this is Collier.

1:31:56.016 --> 1:31:58.016
-We've ID'd the sniper.
-Shit.

1:31:58.101 --> 1:31:59.691
We're circulating his photo now.

1:31:59.770 --> 1:32:01.150
What about bourne?

1:32:01.230 --> 1:32:03.190
Hang on.

1:32:03.315 --> 1:32:05.365
Okay, bourne is just leaving
the west service corridor,

1:32:05.442 --> 1:32:06.782
heading for the lobby.

1:32:06.902 --> 1:32:08.612
Copy that. Stay on bourne.

1:32:11.281 --> 1:32:12.411
What?

1:32:12.449 --> 1:32:13.779
We're still looking for bourne.

1:32:13.867 --> 1:32:15.697
And they've ID'd the asset.

1:32:32.886 --> 1:32:35.056
Go back to the first floor
and wait for further instructions.

1:32:35.138 --> 1:32:36.718
-Yes, sir. Copy that.
-Copy that.

1:32:53.866 --> 1:32:56.026
Everybody down! Right now!

1:32:56.243 --> 1:32:57.623
Down, move, move, move!

1:32:59.162 --> 1:33:01.162
Out of the way! Federal agents! Move!

1:33:24.188 --> 1:33:27.018
Take a team to the northeast elevators.
I'll meet you up there.

1:33:34.823 --> 1:33:36.703
Bourne's on his way up to you.

1:34:26.500 --> 1:34:29.210
You took a long time to get here, Jason.

1:34:30.254 --> 1:34:31.924
I know about Beirut.

1:34:32.756 --> 1:34:34.256
I know what you did.

1:34:35.801 --> 1:34:37.431
It all ends tonight.

1:34:38.011 --> 1:34:40.431
Be a lot easier to do it right away.

1:34:47.855 --> 1:34:49.565
You didn't come here for revenge.

1:34:49.606 --> 1:34:52.726
You came here because
you know it's time to come in.

1:35:00.325 --> 1:35:02.285
Your father created the program.

1:35:02.995 --> 1:35:05.755
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.

1:35:05.789 --> 1:35:07.039
And you did.

1:35:08.083 --> 1:35:09.463
You always did.

1:35:11.879 --> 1:35:13.459
That's why you volunteered.

1:35:13.547 --> 1:35:16.547
I volunteered because
i thought our enemies killed him.

1:35:18.051 --> 1:35:19.641
I volunteered because of a lie.

1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:22.560
No, you volunteered because of who you are.

1:35:22.639 --> 1:35:24.889
You volunteered because
you are Jason bourne,

1:35:24.975 --> 1:35:27.525
and not David webb.

1:35:37.404 --> 1:35:39.074
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

1:35:39.489 --> 1:35:41.239
Every one of them made a difference.

1:35:41.325 --> 1:35:45.625
People all across this country
are safer because of what you did.

1:35:57.007 --> 1:35:58.837
I'm trying to find another way.

1:36:03.096 --> 1:36:05.306
And how's that working out for you?

1:36:13.106 --> 1:36:15.026
You're never going to find any peace.

1:36:16.735 --> 1:36:19.945
Not until you admit to yourself
who you really are.

1:36:22.199 --> 1:36:24.029
It's time to come in, Jason.

1:36:25.953 --> 1:36:27.373
It's time to come in.

1:36:34.002 --> 1:36:35.212
I can't.

1:36:40.551 --> 1:36:41.551
Not for you.

1:37:17.337 --> 1:37:18.837
You were never here.

1:37:26.722 --> 1:37:27.892
You don't have to go after him.

1:37:31.518 --> 1:37:32.888
This can stop now.

1:37:34.104 --> 1:37:35.814
You have a choice.

1:37:58.545 --> 1:38:00.125
- Let's go!
- Have your ids ready.

1:38:00.422 --> 1:38:03.052
Have your ids ready, ladies and gentlemen.

1:38:04.134 --> 1:38:06.894
Have your ids ready!
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

1:38:13.810 --> 1:38:16.980
Stand in a line.
Las Vegas police, ladies and gentlemen!

1:38:59.273 --> 1:39:02.113
Bearcat SWAT truck
and unmarked black dodge charger

1:39:02.192 --> 1:39:03.492
stolen from the front of the Aria.

1:39:10.784 --> 1:39:12.914
Pursuit in progress. Air support requested.

1:39:12.995 --> 1:39:14.125
What was that ID?

1:43:26.081 --> 1:43:27.751
Stop him! Block that road!

1:43:31.086 --> 1:43:32.086
Oh, my god!

1:43:34.298 --> 1:43:35.298
Fire!

1:43:38.719 --> 1:43:39.719
Move out!

1:44:24.848 --> 1:44:25.848
Move!

1:44:29.186 --> 1:44:31.306
Next two units involved, identify.

1:44:31.355 --> 1:44:33.905
This is air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles

1:44:33.982 --> 1:44:35.942
have crashed into
the southeast entrance of the riviera.

1:44:47.579 --> 1:44:48.869
We have
an armed suspect heading into

1:44:48.914 --> 1:44:50.924
the storm drain south of the riviera.

1:45:45.804 --> 1:45:46.814
Aah!

1:46:40.776 --> 1:46:43.446
You're a traitor. You've always been a traitor.

1:46:44.488 --> 1:46:45.818
It's in your blood.

1:48:09.907 --> 1:48:11.407
Mr. kalloor!

1:48:12.910 --> 1:48:15.500
Aaron! What were you
going to tell everyone at the convention?

1:48:15.579 --> 1:48:17.209
What are you hiding, Aaron?

1:48:17.247 --> 1:48:18.247
Easy.

1:48:18.373 --> 1:48:19.373
Get back.

1:48:19.416 --> 1:48:20.746
Why did somebody
try to assassinate you?

1:48:21.043 --> 1:48:23.253
What's the cancer
at the heart of deep dream?

1:48:23.378 --> 1:48:25.918
I think it would be inappropriate
to pass any comment at this stage,

1:48:25.964 --> 1:48:27.884
but I look forward to
working with the authorities

1:48:27.966 --> 1:48:29.586
to find out who was responsible.

1:48:29.635 --> 1:48:30.895
And to getting back to deep dream,

1:48:30.928 --> 1:48:33.258
where we can continue
our important work. Thank you.

1:48:34.097 --> 1:48:35.927
Have you been
lying to your users?

1:49:07.714 --> 1:49:08.724
Sir.

1:49:18.767 --> 1:49:20.477
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

1:49:21.353 --> 1:49:22.983
About Vegas.

1:49:23.188 --> 1:49:26.978
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.

1:49:27.025 --> 1:49:28.435
Unwise?

1:49:29.278 --> 1:49:31.988
We're still trying to come up with
a narrative to explain what happened.

1:49:32.531 --> 1:49:36.531
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on iron hand.

1:49:37.286 --> 1:49:38.826
On all of us.

1:49:38.912 --> 1:49:40.962
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.

1:49:42.749 --> 1:49:43.959
I know Aaron.

1:49:45.085 --> 1:49:47.165
There are still moves we can make with him.

1:49:50.299 --> 1:49:51.509
Tell me.

1:49:52.134 --> 1:49:55.014
Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

1:49:56.680 --> 1:49:58.680
People like kalloor are shaping the future.

1:49:59.641 --> 1:50:01.061
These are my people.

1:50:02.436 --> 1:50:04.596
I know how to deal with him.

1:50:07.524 --> 1:50:09.444
And what do you want?

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:12.280
When you appoint a new agency director,

1:50:12.362 --> 1:50:14.282
you're going to need someone
working for your interests.

1:50:16.491 --> 1:50:17.661
Someone

1:50:18.827 --> 1:50:21.077
empowered by you.

1:50:24.666 --> 1:50:25.706
What about bourne?

1:50:27.252 --> 1:50:29.502
You still think you can bring him in?

1:50:32.299 --> 1:50:33.759
I have his trust.

1:50:34.718 --> 1:50:35.888
After what we went through.

1:50:37.971 --> 1:50:39.391
I'll bring him in.

1:50:39.473 --> 1:50:41.223
I'm certain of it.

1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:45.440
And if you can't?

1:50:47.022 --> 1:50:50.652
Then he'll have to be put down.

1:50:54.404 --> 1:50:56.574
It's an interesting proposal.

1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:03.000
You can pull over here.

1:51:07.876 --> 1:51:11.206
Of course, if you decide
that you don't need me,

1:51:11.296 --> 1:51:12.376
then that's not a problem.

1:51:13.048 --> 1:51:16.178
There are many other agencies
who would want what I know.

1:51:45.956 --> 1:51:47.456
I brought you something.

1:51:53.088 --> 1:51:55.128
It's a cast from your father's star,

1:51:55.174 --> 1:51:57.184
on the memorial wall at Langley.

1:52:07.477 --> 1:52:09.267
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

1:52:12.149 --> 1:52:13.609
How you were treated.

1:52:13.650 --> 1:52:16.320
But the people that did that are gone,

1:52:16.361 --> 1:52:19.911
and things are changing at the agency.

1:52:19.990 --> 1:52:21.570
What is it you want?

1:52:24.912 --> 1:52:26.752
I know you've always been a patriot.

1:52:28.540 --> 1:52:31.330
That what happens to this country
matters to you.

1:52:32.878 --> 1:52:34.798
We need you to help protect us.

1:52:36.465 --> 1:52:37.765
Come back in.

1:52:39.927 --> 1:52:41.717
And we'll work together.

1:52:49.645 --> 1:52:51.155
Let me think about it.

1:52:52.397 --> 1:52:53.817
How will I find you?

1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:42.450
You still think
you can bring him in?

1:53:42.573 --> 1:53:44.243
I have his trust.

1:53:44.992 --> 1:53:46.662
After what we went through.

1:53:47.703 --> 1:53:48.873
I'll bring him in.

1:53:49.538 --> 1:53:51.038
I'm certain of it.

1:53:51.999 --> 1:53:53.379
And if you can't?

1:53:55.460 --> 1:53:58.710
Then he'll have to be put down.
