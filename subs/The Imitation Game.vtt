03:59.840 --> 04:01.774
Last night, you had a break-in.

Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,
called to report the noise.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.543
He said there was
quite a ruckus.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.203
Only you say nothing was taken.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.349
It's odd.
So how about you tell us

the chap who did this.

04:12.452 --> 04:13.749

Gentlemen,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.354
I-I don't believe

04:15.522 --> 04:17.183
that you could find the chap
that did this

04:17.357 --> 04:19.519

and spat in your face.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.422

And how old were you when you
became a Fellow at Cambridge?

- And how old were you

09:41.881 --> 09:44.009
- No.
- Well, that's right,

09:44.184 --> 09:45.618
because we're
a top-secret program.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.879
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

09:48.054 --> 09:49.453
that only last week,

You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.349
What makes you think that?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.852
It's the greatest
encryption device in history,

10:56.022 --> 10:59.117
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.818
If the Allies broke Enigma,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.929

11:05.999 --> 11:08.832

be hiring cryptographers

Y- You need me a lot
more than I need you.

L-I like solving problems,

11:19.546 --> 11:21.139

11:21.314 --> 11:25.046
And Enigma is the most
difficult problem in the world.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.516
No, Enigma isn't difficult;
it's impossible.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.985
The Americans, the Russians,
the French,

11:30.156 --> 11:32.181

everyone thinks Enigma

11:32.358 --> 11:33.416
is unbreakable.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.855
Good.

and we'll know for sure,

11:37.063 --> 11:38.326
<i>We n.</i> t <i>M?</i>

11:40.133 --> 11:42.124
[Denniston]
Welcome to Enigma.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.969
The details of every
surprise attack,

11:47.140 --> 11:50.667
every secret convoy

11:50.843 --> 11:53.005
and every U-boat in
the bloody Atlantic

11:53.179 --> 11:54.908
go into that thing.

11:55.081 --> 11:58.312
And out comes gibberish.

11:58.484 --> 12:01.044
It's beautiful.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.054
[Denniston] It's the crooked
hand of death itself.

12:04.224 --> 12:08.354
Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day,

12:08.528 --> 12:10.519
and to the lovely young ladies

12:10.697 --> 12:12.597
of the Women's Royal Navy,
they're nonsense.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.700
It's only when you feed
them back into Enigma

12:15.868 --> 12:18.064
that they make any sense.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.228
But we have an Enigma machine.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.600
Yes, Polish Intelligence

12:20.773 --> 12:21.865
smuggled it out of Berlin.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.031
[man] So what's the problem?

12:23.209 --> 12:24.438
Just put
the intercepted messages

12:24.611 --> 12:25.601
back into the Enigma
and you'll...

12:25.778 --> 12:28.440
Look, it's not
that simple, is it?

12:28.615 --> 12:30.777
Just having an Enigma machine

12:30.950 --> 12:32.509
doesn't help you to decode
the messages.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.518
[Denniston]
Very good, Mr. Turing.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.350
To decode a message, you need to
know the machine's settings.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.016
Now, the Germans
switch settings

12:41.160 --> 12:43.322
every day promptly at midnight.

12:43.529 --> 12:44.724
We usually intercept

12:44.897 --> 12:46.695
our first message
around 6:00 a.m.,

12:46.866 --> 12:48.459
which gives you exactly

12:48.635 --> 12:52.572
18 hours every day
to crack the code

12:52.739 --> 12:54.935
before it changes,
and you start again.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.473
Five rotors.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.634
Ten plugboard cables.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.210
- One million...
- A thousand million...

13:00.380 --> 13:01.973
No, no, it's,
uh, I've got it.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.446
[man] It's million, million. It's
in the millions, obviously.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.484
It's over 150 million million
million possible settings.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.780
Very good.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.481
159.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.820
If you want to be
exact about it. 1-5-9

13:13.993 --> 13:16.223
with 18 zeroes behind it.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.886
Possibilities.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.793
Every single day.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.458
[Denniston]
Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.330
I personally selected him

13:24.504 --> 13:26.768
- to run this unit.
- Didn't you...

13:26.939 --> 13:28.907
Mr. Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.474
Twice.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.974
[Denniston]
You're not the only one

13:32.145 --> 13:33.340
who's good at games
around here, Turing.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.005
Are-are we
to work together, then?

13:36.182 --> 13:38.344
I prefer to have my own office.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.350
You're a team,
and you will work as one.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.852
I-I-I don't have time
to explain myself as I go along,

13:43.022 --> 13:44.615
and I'm afraid these men

13:44.791 --> 13:47.021
- would only slow me down.
- [chuckles] If you can't

13:47.193 --> 13:50.163
play together, then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.025
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.189
There are only five divisions
of military intelligence.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.267
There is no MI6.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.801
Exactly.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.337
That's the spirit.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.304
Mr. Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen

14:02.475 --> 14:03.465
have died because of Enigma?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.543
Uh, no, I don't.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.476
Three...

14:07.647 --> 14:08.637
while we've been having

14:08.815 --> 14:10.783
this conversation.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.548
Oh, look, there's another.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.849
I rather hope he
didn't have a family.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.323
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

14:20.493 --> 14:22.222
we're not winning it.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.022
Break the code,

14:24.197 --> 14:27.132
at least we have a chance.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.860
Shall we leave
the children alone

14:30.036 --> 14:31.561
with their new toy?

14:31.738 --> 14:32.830
<i>Hm.</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:40.040
All right, gentlemen...

14:40.213 --> 14:42.875
- [door closes]
- let's play.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.185
[Turing]
The game was quite a simple one.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.694
Every single German message,
every surprise attack,

14:54.861 --> 14:56.488
every bombing run,

14:56.662 --> 14:59.188
every imminent U-boat assault...

14:59.365 --> 15:01.333
[Morse code transmissions]

15:05.371 --> 15:07.669
They were all floating
through the air.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.409
[Morse code transmissions]

15:17.283 --> 15:19.115
Radio signals that...

15:19.285 --> 15:22.220
well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit

15:22.388 --> 15:23.947
could intercept.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.921
[Morse code continues]

15:26.092 --> 15:29.426
The trick was
that they were encrypted.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.375
There were 159 million
million million possible

15:43.543 --> 15:45.307
Enigma settings.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.742
All we had to do
was try each one.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.978
But if we had ten men checking
one setting a minute

15:55.154 --> 15:58.613
for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,

15:58.791 --> 16:03.319
how many days do you think
it would take to, uh, to check

16:03.496 --> 16:05.897
each of the settings?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.831
Well, it's not days, it's years.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.562
Good morning.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.572
[Turing] It's 2O million years.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.471
- To stop a coming attack,
- Thank you.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.773
We would have to check
2O million years' worth

16:21.948 --> 16:23.677
of settings

16:23.850 --> 16:26.012
in 2O minutes.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.268
[sonar pinging]

16:47.473 --> 16:50.204
[loud whirring]

16:52.478 --> 16:53.502
I'm famished.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.647
Lunch?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.146
[Alexander]
Good Lord. What is it

16:57.316 --> 16:59.182
about women with little hats?

17:06.125 --> 17:09.652
The boys, we're going
to get some lunch.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.566
Alan?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.168
Yes'?

17:16.335 --> 17:17.894
I said we're going
to get some lunch.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.074
Alan?

17:22.241 --> 17:23.231
Yes'?

17:23.409 --> 17:24.843
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

17:25.011 --> 17:28.174
[chuckles] I said we're
off to get some Iu...

17:28.347 --> 17:30.475
This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.015
- What is?
- I had asked

17:32.184 --> 17:33.515
if you wanted to come
to lunch with us.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.085
Um, no, you didn't.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.348
You said you were going
to get some lunch.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.514
Have I offended you in some way?

17:39.692 --> 17:40.853
Why would you think that?

17:41.027 --> 17:43.519
Would you like to come to lunch
with us?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.425
- What time's lunchtime?
- Christ, Alan,

17:45.598 --> 17:46.690
it's a bleeding sandwich.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.595
- What is?
- Lunch.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.532
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.898
Never mind.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.732
You know,

17:53.906 --> 17:56.068
to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

17:56.242 --> 17:57.835
one actually has to be
a genius, Alan.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.341
And yet we're the ones

17:59.512 --> 18:00.570
making progress here,
aren't we?

18:00.746 --> 18:01.907
Oh, you are?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.106
Yes, we are.

18:04.283 --> 18:07.617
We have decrypted a number
of German messages

18:07.787 --> 18:11.018
by analyzing the frequency
of letter distribution.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.625
Oh, even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.591
That-That's not progress;
that's just blind luck.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.627
I'm designing a machine

18:17.797 --> 18:20.027
that will allow us
to break every message

18:20.199 --> 18:24.033
every day instantly.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.567
Who's hungry?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.733
Let's go.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.069
I'm hungry-

18:31.310 --> 18:32.778
What?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.913
[Turing]
Peter asked who was hungry.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.446
Can I have some soup, please?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.607
[chuckles]

18:40.386 --> 18:41.979
[door opens]

18:42.154 --> 18:43.588
[laughter]

18:43.756 --> 18:45.087
[door closes]

18:56.135 --> 18:58.627
[sighs]

19:14.987 --> 19:16.978
<i>II</i>

20:03.502 --> 20:05.903
What do you mean, "classified"?

20:06.072 --> 20:08.905
No, I'm aware of the literal
meaning of the word classified.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.066
What I'm asking is why would
a maths professor

20:11.243 --> 20:13.678
have his military records
classified?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.315
Yeah, well, I will come down.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.724
[bell dings]

20:37.737 --> 20:40.172
Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.

20:40.339 --> 20:43.570
Service records
of a Mr. Turing.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.767
Alan.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.276
Foreign Office sent me.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.209
[bicycle bell clinging]

20:53.586 --> 20:55.918
This is unacceptable.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.954
If you wish to discuss
the complaint,

20:58.124 --> 20:59.250
I suggest you make
a proper appointment.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.415
Alexan...

21:00.593 --> 21:01.719
Complaint?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.293
No, no, Hugh Alexander

21:03.462 --> 21:05.897
has denied my requisition
for parts

21:06.065 --> 21:08.090
and-and equipment that I need to
build the machine I've designed.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.133
Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you,

21:10.302 --> 21:11.701
and they filed
a formal complaint.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.396
It's is inspired
by an old Polish code machine.

21:13.572 --> 21:16.303
Only this one
is infinitely more advanced.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.772
If you don't respond
to the complaint,

21:17.943 --> 21:19.570
I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.110
Put those files by my desk.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.748
Fine, my response is
they're all idiots.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
Fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.749
I only need
about 100,000 pounds.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.149
100,000...

21:31.757 --> 21:33.452
Why are you building a machine?

21:33.626 --> 21:36.755
[sighs] It's highly technical.
You wouldn't understand.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.626
I suggest you make
the effort to try.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.734
Enigma is...

21:42.902 --> 21:44.631
an extremely
well-designed machine.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.603
Our problem is that we're only
using men to try to beat it.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.673
No, what if only a machine

21:49.842 --> 21:52.174
can defeat another machine?

21:52.344 --> 21:53.812
Well, that's not very technical.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.344
Hugh Alexander is in charge

21:55.514 --> 21:57.846
of your unit; he said no,
and that is that.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.451
I simply don't have time
for this.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.451
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

22:02.621 --> 22:04.487
I have.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.318
Do you know how it's done?

22:06.492 --> 22:07.653
Order, discipline,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.295
chain of command.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.088
You're not at university
any longer.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.665
You are a very small cog
in a very large system.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.360
And you will do as your
commanding officer instructs.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.334
Yes.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.200
[clears throat]

22:21.373 --> 22:24.536
Who-who is
your commanding officer?

22:24.710 --> 22:26.542
Winston Churchill,

22:26.712 --> 22:27.975
Number 1O Downing Street,

22:28.147 --> 22:29.706
London, SW1 .

22:29.882 --> 22:31.509
You have a problem
with my decision,

22:31.684 --> 22:33.846
you can take it up with him.

22:39.124 --> 22:40.614
[Turing]
Mr. Menzies!

22:40.759 --> 22:43.990
Mr. Menzies!

22:44.163 --> 22:47.463
A-A-Are you going to London?

22:47.633 --> 22:49.397
Possibly.

22:49.568 --> 22:53.004
Would you deliver
a letter for me?

22:58.677 --> 22:59.803
[Alexander]
Look, I'm sorry,

22:59.979 --> 23:01.276
but are you joking?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.505
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

23:03.682 --> 23:06.208
- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.752
So I can give these
men orders now?

23:08.921 --> 23:10.855
I hate to say it, but yes.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.855
Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.354
- Excuse me?
- What?

23:15.527 --> 23:16.824
You're mediocre linguists,

23:16.996 --> 23:19.328
and positively
poor code-breakers.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.897
Alan, you can't just
fire Keith and Charles.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.431
Well, he just said I could.

23:22.601 --> 23:23.830
No, I did no such thing.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.528
But Churchill did.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.008
[sighs]

23:35.147 --> 23:37.115
Go to hell.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.712
Well,

23:43.889 --> 23:45.584
this is inhuman.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.283
Even for you.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.194
Popular at school, were you?

24:00.039 --> 24:01.529
[Turing]
The problem began, of course,

24:01.707 --> 24:03.698
with the carrots.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.708
Carrots are orange.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.243
And peas

24:07.413 --> 24:08.608
are green.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.613
They mustn't touch.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.622
[laughter]

24:26.765 --> 24:27.755
[laughter continues]

24:27.933 --> 24:29.423
[sobbing]

24:29.601 --> 24:31.262
I got it.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.838
[Turing]
Do you know why people

24:36.008 --> 24:37.134
like violence?

24:37.309 --> 24:40.176
It is because it feels...

24:40.346 --> 24:41.336
good.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.641
Humans find violence

24:43.816 --> 24:45.841
deeply satisfying.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.648
But remove the-the satisfaction,

24:49.822 --> 24:52.655
and the act becomes...

24:52.825 --> 24:55.351
- [panting]
- hollow.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.495
[creaking]

25:00.833 --> 25:02.995
[student]
Tuflng?

25:03.168 --> 25:05.193
Come on.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.668
Don't be such a kike about it.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.864
[sighs]

25:09.041 --> 25:10.839
[student 2]
Leave him to bloody rot.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.149
[Turing]
I didn't learn this on my own,

25:18.317 --> 25:19.716
of course.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.011
I had help.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.645
Christopher helped.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.322
Alan, are you all right?

25:27.493 --> 25:28.824
[panting]

25:28.994 --> 25:31.895
[grunts]

25:34.133 --> 25:35.623
It's not my fault.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.498
The carrots got in
with the peas and...

25:38.670 --> 25:39.796
I'm sorry.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.167
I won't let them do it again.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.899
They're getting worse.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.510
They only beat me up because
I'm smarter than they are.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.907
No, they beat you up
because you're different.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.139
Mother says
I'm just an odd duck.

25:50.315 --> 25:52.340
And she's right.

25:52.518 --> 25:54.350
But you know, Alan,

25:54.520 --> 25:57.421
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

25:57.589 --> 25:59.853
who do the things
no one can imagine.

26:06.498 --> 26:09.229
So, what do we do now?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.392
We're short on staff.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.935
[Turing]
Well, we, uh, we get

26:13.105 --> 26:14.368
more staff then.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.406
And how do you propose
to do that?

26:37.796 --> 26:39.787
[whistle blowing]

26:51.243 --> 26:53.075

Um, Alan Turing

28:46.858 --> 28:48.485
to see Stewart Menzies.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.025
Very good, sir.

28:50.195 --> 28:52.163
[Menzies]
So who are they?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.594
Oh, all sorts, really.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.392
Teacher, an engineer,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.160
a handful of students.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.826
And you think they're
qualified for Bletchley

28:59.004 --> 29:00.563
'cause they're good
at crossword puzzles?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.730
Well, they say they're good,
and now we shall find out,

29:02.908 --> 29:04.376
<i>We n.</i> t <i>M?</i>

29:04.543 --> 29:06.170
In order to aid your efforts,

29:06.545 --> 29:08.707
there is, to the right of you,
a green scratch card book.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.245
You are to make notes in that.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.940
Gentlemen, you
have six minutes

29:12.117 --> 29:14.085
in which to complete the
puzzle, at which point,

29:14.253 --> 29:15.243
I will...

29:18.123 --> 29:19.215
Pardon, ma'am,
this room's restricted.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.722
Oh, apologies
for my tardiness.

29:20.892 --> 29:21.882
The-the bus caught a flat tire.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.552
Uh, may I continue, please?

29:24.730 --> 29:26.528
- Thank you.
- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.325
Oh, but I'm only
a few minutes late.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.058
The secretaries are
to head upstairs.

29:30.235 --> 29:31.760
This room's for the candidates.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.905
May I get on with
this now, please?

29:34.072 --> 29:36.404
L-I am a candidate.

29:36.575 --> 29:37.565
- For what position?
- [groans]

29:37.743 --> 29:38.904
The letter didn't say precisely.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.374
Yeah, so secretaries
are to head upstairs.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.138
It did say
that it was top secret.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.873
What is going on?

29:44.049 --> 29:45.244
L-I solved

29:45.417 --> 29:46.816
a-a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper,

29:46.985 --> 29:48.544
and I-l got this letter saying

29:48.720 --> 29:50.814
that I was a candidate for
some sort of mysterious job.

29:50.989 --> 29:52.582
My name's Joan Clarke.

29:52.758 --> 29:56.422
Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.264
What makes you think I couldn't
solve the puzzle myself?

30:00.432 --> 30:01.922
- L-I'm really very good at...
- Ma'am,

30:02.100 --> 30:03.261
- I'll have to ask you to...
- Miss Clarke,

30:03.435 --> 30:04.903
I-I find tardiness

30:05.070 --> 30:09.632
under any circumstance,
um, unacceptable.

30:11.276 --> 30:15.008
Take a seat so that
we may continue.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.182
[softly]
Thank you.

30:20.185 --> 30:21.277
[Turing]
Now, um,

30:21.453 --> 30:23.478
as I was saying,
you-you have six minutes

30:23.655 --> 30:26.625
to, uh, complete the task
in front of you.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.489
Uh, gentlemen and lady,

30:29.661 --> 30:32.255
begin.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.283
<i>II</i>

30:59.157 --> 31:01.717
Six minutes.

31:01.893 --> 31:03.156
Is that even possible?

31:03.328 --> 31:05.387
No, it takes me eight.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.328
This isn't about
crossword puzzles.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.864
It's about how one, uh,

31:09.034 --> 31:10.695
approaches solving an
impossible problem.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.702
Do you tackle the whole thing
at once or divide it

31:13.872 --> 31:16.364
into small...

31:16.541 --> 31:17.906
You've finished?

31:18.076 --> 31:20.067
Yes.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.754
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

31:35.927 --> 31:39.192
You said to do it in under six.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.162
[Menzies]
Congratulations.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.268
My warmest welcome to
His Majesty's service.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.666
If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,

31:46.838 --> 31:48.670
you will be executed
for high treason.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.175
You will lie to your friends,

31:51.343 --> 31:53.107
your family
and everyone you meet

31:53.278 --> 31:55.610
about what it is you really do.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.777
And what is it
that we're really doing?

31:59.951 --> 32:01.851
We're going to break
an unbreakable Nazi code

32:02.020 --> 32:03.613
and win the war.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.019
Oh.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.091
[bells tolling]

32:08.260 --> 32:10.126
[boys shouting playfully
nearby]

32:15.133 --> 32:17.761
What's that you're reading?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.200
It's about cryptography.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.840
Like secret messages?

32:22.040 --> 32:24.099
Not secret.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.142
That's the brilliant part.

32:26.311 --> 32:29.406
Messages that anyone can see,
but no one knows what they mean

32:29.581 --> 32:31.572
unless you have the key.

32:36.922 --> 32:39.914
How's that different
from talking?

32:40.091 --> 32:41.957
- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,

32:42.127 --> 32:43.288
they never say what they mean.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.930
They say something else,

32:45.096 --> 32:47.394
and you're expected to
just know what they mean.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.001
Only I never do.

32:50.168 --> 32:53.763
So, how's that different?

32:55.006 --> 32:56.405
Alan, I have a funny feeling

32:56.575 --> 32:58.475
you're going to be
very good at this.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.853
[chuckles]

33:24.469 --> 33:25.834
Good night, Alan.

33:30.475 --> 33:32.443
Good night.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.719
[woman] Hold on,
Marion, I'm coming!

33:46.892 --> 33:48.860
Coming round the lesser settings
and then route back through...

33:49.027 --> 33:50.495
- [thumps loudly]
- Back to those ones...

33:50.662 --> 33:52.460
Uh, careful, will you?

33:52.631 --> 33:54.190
Um, it-it's not a toy.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.697
[Alexander]
Funny.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.857
Looks like a toy.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.367
Bloody great
100,000-pound one.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.165
Your new minion's arrived.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.500
Jack Good. We met...

34:02.674 --> 34:05.006
Well, where's Miss Clarke?

34:07.178 --> 34:09.476
Lovely, isn't he?

34:09.648 --> 34:14.484
[Turing] It's not just a-a usual
humdrum production mill factory.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.814
I mean, well,
as-as I was saying,

34:15.987 --> 34:19.252
it's a very important,
uh, radio factory.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.654
I-It's not, actually.
Uh, well, um,

34:21.826 --> 34:24.227
on the spectrum of,
uh... radio factories,

34:24.396 --> 34:27.058
this-this one
is-is particularly...

[bird chirping]

34:32.837 --> 34:34.601
[quiet sigh]

34:37.509 --> 34:39.841
Why are you not
at Bletchley?

34:40.011 --> 34:42.878
Thank you... so much for
your visit, Mr. Turing.

34:43.048 --> 34:45.244
- Was your trip pleasant?
- Gather your things and let's go.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.250
I'm sorry, but I'm unable
to accept your offer.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.388
We feel that
such a position

34:50.555 --> 34:52.080
would hardly
be appropriate.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.385
You earned a double first
in mathematics.

34:54.559 --> 34:57.358
But sadly wasn't granted the
opportunity to become a Fellow.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.395
You belong at Bletchley.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.999
[Joan] I'm sorry,
but for someone in my position

35:02.200 --> 35:04.430
to live... to...

35:04.603 --> 35:07.470
to work in a radio factory
so far from home,

35:07.639 --> 35:09.630
with all your
men, um...

35:09.808 --> 35:11.936
it-it would be...

35:12.110 --> 35:13.874
indecorous.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.941
What in the world
does that even mean?

35:18.984 --> 35:22.648

35:26.891 --> 35:29.656
clerical tasks:
assistants, translators.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.229
Uh, they live,
um, together in town.

35:32.397 --> 35:36.459
W-W-Would that be a more,
uh, suitable environment?

35:36.635 --> 35:40.503
Hm. So-so I would be working
amongst these women?

35:40.672 --> 35:42.162
Yes.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.405
Wonderful ladies. Uh, they
even organize social events

35:47.579 --> 35:49.911
at St. Martin's Church
down the road.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.175
Uh, really, the whole thing
is-is quite, uh...

35:52.350 --> 35:53.579
uh, um...

35:53.752 --> 35:56.084
decorous.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.282
[dog barking in distance]

36:00.458 --> 36:02.119
Now, you won't have proper
security clearance,

36:02.293 --> 36:05.024
of course, so, uh, we'll have
to improvise things a bit.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.630
Why are you helping me?

36:06.798 --> 36:08.698
Because there is only
one thing that matters

36:08.867 --> 36:10.926
in this entire world right
now... do you understand?...

36:11.102 --> 36:12.467
and that is
breaking Enigma.

36:12.637 --> 36:15.607
But-but, Mr. Turing...

36:15.774 --> 36:17.833
why are you helping me?

36:18.009 --> 36:21.172
Oh. Um...

36:21.346 --> 36:24.611
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

36:24.783 --> 36:28.344
who do the things that
no one can imagine.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.822
<i>II</i>

36:46.404 --> 36:48.338
Sir.

36:48.506 --> 36:49.496
What's this?

36:49.674 --> 36:52.735
Alan Turing's
classified military file.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.881
- It's bloody empty.
- Exactly.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.176
- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.

36:59.350 --> 37:02.115
Well, you've cracked the case
wide open, then, haven't you?

37:02.320 --> 37:04.516
Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,

37:04.689 --> 37:06.350
they're nonexistent.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.424
That means someone's
got rid of them.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.186
Erased them.
Burned them.

37:10.361 --> 37:13.558
And that same person broke into
his house and stole nothing?

37:14.999 --> 37:17.161
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

37:17.335 --> 37:18.700
What, the spies
from the papers?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.201
The Soviet spies.

37:20.371 --> 37:23.705
But first they were
professors, weren't they?

37:23.875 --> 37:25.775
Radicalized at Cambridge,

37:25.944 --> 37:27.241
then they joined
the Communist Party,

37:27.412 --> 37:29.107
then Foreign Office,
then leaked information

37:29.280 --> 37:31.112
to Stalin during
the war... now,

37:31.282 --> 37:33.683
can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,

37:33.852 --> 37:36.753
then took up something murky and
top secret when war broke out?

37:36.921 --> 37:39.788
You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?

37:39.958 --> 37:41.119
I think...

37:41.292 --> 37:43.283
something very serious
is happening

50:34.365 --> 50:36.197
Here. Look at this.

50:38.035 --> 50:41.437
If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,

50:41.639 --> 50:44.540
it will eliminate rotor
positions 500 times faster.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.870
That's, uh...

50:47.044 --> 50:49.536
actually not an entirely
terrible idea.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.844
I think that was Alan
for "thank you."

50:57.755 --> 50:59.189
Uh, th-that's my sandwich.

50:59.356 --> 51:01.586
You don't like sandwiches.

51:01.759 --> 51:02.851

[newsman] The German Army
has fanned out across Europe,

52:23.140 --> 52:25.837
from Poland to Serbia,
Lithuania to Denmark,

The Nazi flag now flies
from more than two dozen

- open the bloody door.
- Uh, no.

54:00.704 --> 54:02.172
No.

54:03.607 --> 54:05.439
Open the door or
we'll break it down.

[whirring and clacking

54:31.301 --> 54:33.736
Well, then, it seems
that your great big

54:33.904 --> 54:36.202
expensive machine
doesn't work.

54:36.373 --> 54:37.568
[panting]

54:37.741 --> 54:39.106
[whispers]
It does.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.471
Wonderful.

54:40.644 --> 54:42.703
So you've broken
Enigma, then?

54:42.880 --> 54:45.440
It was just...

54:45.616 --> 54:47.812
s-still working.

54:47.985 --> 54:50.215
This is my associate
from the Home Office.

54:50.387 --> 54:52.014
You see, a hundred
thousand pounds

54:52.222 --> 54:53.917
is rather a
lot of money,

54:54.091 --> 54:57.083
and he's here to see what
you have to show for it.

54:57.261 --> 55:00.492
You... will never
understand

55:00.664 --> 55:04.965
the importance of what
I-l am creating here!

55:05.135 --> 55:08.332
Have you decrypted
any German messages?

55:08.505 --> 55:11.133
A single one?

55:11.308 --> 55:14.938
Can you point to anything
at all that you've achieved?

55:15.112 --> 55:18.343
Hmm. Your funding is up,

55:18.515 --> 55:20.813
and our patience
is expired.

55:20.984 --> 55:22.577
It's with such
great pleasure

55:22.753 --> 55:25.017
that I am finally
able to say this.

55:25.189 --> 55:28.591
Alan Turing,
you're fired.

55:28.759 --> 55:32.662
Please escort Mr. Turing
from the premises.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.765
[Alexander]
No.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.197
[Denniston]
I beg your pardon?

55:42.039 --> 55:45.942
If you fire Alan...

55:46.109 --> 55:48.203
well, then you'll
have to fire me, too.

55:48.378 --> 55:51.040
What on earth are you saying?

55:51.215 --> 55:52.649
[Alexander] Trust me when
I tell you there is no one

55:52.816 --> 55:56.116
who would rather say this
less than I do, but...

55:56.787 --> 55:57.777
he's right.

55:57.955 --> 56:00.014
Alan is right.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.318
His machine can work,
and it's probably

56:02.492 --> 56:04.392
the best chance
that we've got.

56:04.561 --> 56:06.825
God, it's beyond belief.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.056
[Cairncross]
If you fire them...

56:09.233 --> 56:11.634
you'll have to
fire me, too.

56:11.802 --> 56:13.531
[Peter]
And me.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.867
[Alexander] We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.008
Are you going to fire us all?

56:19.176 --> 56:21.577
Commander, at least
give us some more time.

56:21.745 --> 56:24.237
Six months, and if the
machine doesn't produce

56:24.414 --> 56:26.143
any results that we need,
then we'll go back

56:26.316 --> 56:28.546
to doing things the old way...
how about that?

56:35.259 --> 56:37.387
One month.

56:37.561 --> 56:38.995
And then,
so help me God,

56:39.162 --> 56:41.028
you're all gone.

56:41.198 --> 56:42.893
Oh, leave him.

You're welcome.

Oh, and, Alan,

57:12.963 --> 57:14.453
I swear...

57:15.299 --> 57:18.633
I'm not a spy.

57:18.802 --> 57:21.430
Oh, for God's sake, of course
you're not a bloody spy.

57:21.605 --> 57:22.766
What?

57:22.940 --> 57:24.305
Denniston gave me
the Beale cipher,

57:24.474 --> 57:25.635
and guess what?

57:25.809 --> 57:26.970
I cracked it.

57:27.144 --> 57:29.374
"Ask, and it shall
be given to you;

57:29.546 --> 57:31.947
seek and ye shall find."
Matthew 7:7.

57:32.115 --> 57:34.413
That was the key.

57:34.584 --> 57:37.485
Far too simple
for the likes of you.

57:38.889 --> 57:41.551
Pity Denniston disagrees.

57:44.394 --> 57:46.590
<i>II</i>

57:50.767 --> 57:53.134
- [knocking]
- Come in.

57:55.339 --> 57:57.831
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

57:58.008 --> 57:59.407
Itailed him

57:59.576 --> 58:01.874
to a pub last night,
where he met a bloke.

58:02.079 --> 58:03.069
They exchanged an envelope.

58:03.246 --> 58:04.839
So I follow
this other fella,

58:05.015 --> 58:06.642
pick him up,
give him a good shake.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.616
He's a poofter.
He confessed.

58:10.787 --> 58:12.118
What?

58:12.289 --> 58:14.519
The man admitted it.
Arnold Murray.

58:14.691 --> 58:17.422
Hangs around that pub;
men pay him for a go.

58:17.594 --> 58:19.289
Turing's one of
the men that paid.

58:19.463 --> 58:20.624
Only Mr. Murray here

58:20.797 --> 58:22.492
then has the
bright idea

58:22.666 --> 58:25.465
of robbing Turing's house
after, with a friend.

58:25.635 --> 58:27.125
That's what Turing's hiding.

58:27.304 --> 58:29.466
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

58:29.639 --> 58:30.868
- No.
- What's the matter?

58:31.041 --> 58:32.600
We can charge a
university professor

58:32.743 --> 58:34.142
- with indecency.
- No, this is...

58:34.311 --> 58:35.676
it's bloody rubbish.

58:35.846 --> 58:36.836
Turing's up
to something important...

58:37.014 --> 58:39.278
He's committed a crime
and he's broken the law.

58:39.449 --> 58:41.178
And with a bloke.
Jesus Christ,

58:41.351 --> 58:42.944
- it's bloody disgusting.
- This isn't

58:43.120 --> 58:44.610
the investigation
I was conducting.

58:44.788 --> 58:46.882
Bring him in.

58:47.057 --> 58:48.991
Wait.
[exhales]

58:49.159 --> 58:50.149
L-Let me interrogate him.

58:50.327 --> 58:52.455
Please. Give me
half an hour alone,

58:52.629 --> 58:54.461
and then I swear,
I'll spend the next month

58:54.631 --> 58:56.861
running errands on as many
rubbish cases as you like.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.833
Fine. Now,
will someone get me a warrant

59:00.003 --> 59:02.028
for the arrest of Alan Turing.

59:08.879 --> 59:11.974
[birds chirping,
dog barking in distance]

59:18.722 --> 59:19.883
Alan?

59:20.057 --> 59:23.049
Christopher's simply
not moving fast enough.

59:23.226 --> 59:26.059
- We should talk.
- And even with the diagonal board,

59:26.229 --> 59:27.754
he's still not eliminating
settings as quickly

59:27.931 --> 59:29.660
- as we need him to in order...
- I'm leaving.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.494
But you've
just walked in.

59:31.668 --> 59:32.760
No.

59:32.936 --> 59:34.700
No. Bletchley.

59:34.871 --> 59:35.929
What?

59:36.106 --> 59:37.369
It's my parents.

59:37.541 --> 59:39.839
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,
I'm living alone,

59:40.010 --> 59:41.239
and they want me home.

59:41.411 --> 59:43.402
[chuckles]
That's ridiculous.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.173
That's my parents.

59:45.348 --> 59:48.841
You... you can't leave...
l-l won't let you.

59:49.019 --> 59:51.886
<i>"I'll</i> miss you." That's
what a normal person

59:52.055 --> 59:54.683
- might say in this situation.
- I-l don't care what is normal.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.088
What am I supposed

59:56.259 --> 59:59.251
to do, Alan?

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.988
L-I will not...

1:00:01.198 --> 1:00:02.688
give up my parents.
[laughs]

1:00:03.733 --> 1:00:06.134
You... you have
an opportunity here

1:00:06.303 --> 1:00:08.135
to make some actual use
of your life.

1:00:08.305 --> 1:00:10.933
And end up like you?
No, thanks.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:13.236
- [Alan panting]
- I'm sorry you're lonely.

1:00:13.410 --> 1:00:16.573
But Enigma
will not save you.

1:00:16.746 --> 1:00:19.306
Can you decipher that,
you fragile narcissist?

1:00:19.483 --> 1:00:20.507
Or would you like me
to go and fetch

1:00:20.717 --> 1:00:22.207
your precious Christopher
to help?

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:28.152

1:00:28.325 --> 1:00:29.554
I'm sorry.

Mm...

1:00:32.829 --> 1:00:34.820
[exhales]

1:00:36.566 --> 1:00:39.661
I want you... I want you to stay
because I-l like you.

1:00:39.836 --> 1:00:43.101
I like...
talking to you.

1:00:43.273 --> 1:00:45.605
I like talking to you,
too, Alan.

1:00:50.947 --> 1:00:53.314
And what if you weren't alone?

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:55.417
What if you had a husband?

1:00:55.585 --> 1:00:56.950
[chuckles]

1:00:57.120 --> 1:00:59.088
Do you have one in mind?

1:00:59.256 --> 1:01:00.621
I do.

1:01:00.790 --> 1:01:02.417
Hugh? [sniffles]

1:01:02.592 --> 1:01:04.526
Hugh's terribly attractive,
I'll give you that,

1:01:04.694 --> 1:01:06.822
but I don't really think
he's the marrying kind.

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:09.989
[chuckles] No, I-l wasn't
thinking of Hugh.

1:01:10.167 --> 1:01:11.692
Or Peter.

1:01:11.868 --> 1:01:13.962
Peter's so quiet.

1:01:18.441 --> 1:01:20.341
Oh, my God.

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:21.807
But this makes sense.

1:01:21.978 --> 1:01:23.446
Did you just propose to me?

1:01:23.613 --> 1:01:26.241
Well, it is
the logical thing to do.

1:01:26.449 --> 1:01:28.713
- This is ridiculous.
- This is your parents.

1:01:28.885 --> 1:01:32.344
L-| can't... believe
that this is happening.

1:01:34.224 --> 1:01:36.386
Mm. Joan...

1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:37.891
[exhales]

1:01:38.061 --> 1:01:40.393
Is your middle name
Caroline or Catherine?

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:43.556
- Elizabeth.
- Um, Joan Elizabeth...

1:01:43.733 --> 1:01:45.531
Clarke, um...

1:01:47.737 --> 1:01:50.672
...will you marry me?

1:01:59.182 --> 1:02:00.980
[woman]
It's beautiful.

1:02:01.117 --> 1:02:05.145
Well, I know
it isn't ordinary, but...

1:02:05.288 --> 1:02:08.155
whoever loved ordinary?

1:02:08.291 --> 1:02:09.315
[Alexander] She had it
in both hands...

1:02:09.492 --> 1:02:10.482
[laughing]

1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:13.459
And she looked up at me
with her doe eyes and said,

1:02:13.663 --> 1:02:15.654
"Am I supposed
to put that in my mouth?"

1:02:15.832 --> 1:02:19.564
And I said, "Yes.
You know, the French way."

1:02:19.736 --> 1:02:21.431
So she pops it in,

1:02:21.605 --> 1:02:23.266
clamps her lips around it,

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:26.375
and starts humming
the bloody Marseillaise.

1:14:35.638 --> 1:14:37.128

1:14:37.306 --> 1:14:40.173
They send a weather report
every day at 6:00 a.m.

1:14:40.343 --> 1:14:43.608
So that's-that's three

"weather," obviously,

and every day we performed

1:35:03.665 --> 1:35:07.295
our blood-soaked calculus.

1:35:07.468 --> 1:35:11.837
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

1:35:12.006 --> 1:35:13.303
Every day we...

1:35:13.474 --> 1:35:17.502
helped the Allies to victories,
and nobody knew.

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:20.479
[siren blaring]

1:35:20.648 --> 1:35:23.515

- Stalingrad.

1:35:23.685 --> 1:35:24.880
The Ardenne.

1:35:25.053 --> 1:35:26.543
The invasion of Normandy.

1:35:26.721 --> 1:35:29.349
All victories that
would not have been possible

1:35:29.524 --> 1:35:32.152
without the intelligence
that we supplied.

1:35:33.494 --> 1:35:35.155
And people...

1:35:35.296 --> 1:35:39.324
talk about the war as
this epic battle between, um...

1:35:39.500 --> 1:35:41.867
civilizations...

1:35:42.036 --> 1:35:43.868
freedom versus tyranny,

1:35:44.038 --> 1:35:46.905
democracy versus Nazism,

1:35:47.075 --> 1:35:48.839
armies of millions

1:35:49.010 --> 1:35:50.637
bleeding into the ground,

1:35:50.845 --> 1:35:54.748
fleets of ships
weighing down the oceans,

1:35:54.916 --> 1:35:56.611
planes dropping bombs
from the sky

1:35:56.784 --> 1:35:59.253
until they obliterated
the sun itself...

1:35:59.420 --> 1:36:00.615
[birds chirping]

1:36:00.788 --> 1:36:04.452
The war wasn't like that for us.

1:36:05.793 --> 1:36:07.727
For us, it was just...

1:36:09.397 --> 1:36:11.388
...half a dozen
crossword enthusiasts

1:36:11.566 --> 1:36:14.729
in a tiny village
in the South of England.

1:36:14.902 --> 1:36:16.927
[Winston Churchill]
This is...

1:36:17.105 --> 1:36:18.937
your victory.

1:36:19.107 --> 1:36:22.304
- [crowd cheering]
- Victory...

1:36:22.477 --> 1:36:24.502
of the cause of freedom

1:36:24.712 --> 1:36:26.271
in every land.

1:36:26.447 --> 1:36:28.245
[cheering, shouting]

1:36:30.785 --> 1:36:34.585
[President Truman] This is
a solemn but glorious hour.

1:36:34.756 --> 1:36:37.748
I wish that
Franklin D. Roosevelt

1:36:37.925 --> 1:36:39.984
had lived to see this day.

1:36:40.161 --> 1:36:41.492
[Turing]
Was I God?

1:36:41.663 --> 1:36:43.722
No. Because...

1:36:43.898 --> 1:36:46.424
God didn't win the war.

1:36:46.601 --> 1:36:48.626
We did.

1:37:01.349 --> 1:37:04.751

So, what happens now?

1:37:04.919 --> 1:37:08.685
Is it... back to university
for us, I suppose?

1:37:08.856 --> 1:37:10.415
Yes, pretty much.

1:37:10.591 --> 1:37:11.922
But you've one thing left to do

1:37:12.093 --> 1:37:13.185
before your service
to your government

1:37:13.361 --> 1:37:15.420
- in concluded.
- What's that?

1:37:15.596 --> 1:37:17.428
Burn everything.

1:37:17.598 --> 1:37:19.623
- Burn? Why?
- You were told when you started

1:37:19.801 --> 1:37:24.534
this was a top-secret program...
did you think we were joking?

1:37:24.706 --> 1:37:26.435
- But the war is over.
- [Turing] This war is.

1:37:26.607 --> 1:37:28.302
But there'll be others.

1:37:28.476 --> 1:37:30.672
And we know how to break a code

1:37:30.845 --> 1:37:34.110
that everybody else believes
is unbreakable.

1:37:34.282 --> 1:37:36.683
[Menzies]
Precisely.

1:37:36.851 --> 1:37:39.149
Tear it down.
Light it up.

1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:40.845
Sweep away the ashes.

1:37:41.022 --> 1:37:42.387
None of you have
ever met before.

1:37:42.557 --> 1:37:45.959
None of you have ever even heard
the word Enigma.

1:37:47.495 --> 1:37:50.226
Have a safe
trip home.

1:37:52.567 --> 1:37:55.832
[Menzies] Behave. With a bit
of luck, you'll never have

1:37:56.003 --> 1:37:59.462
to see me or one another again
for the rest of your lives.

1:38:14.422 --> 1:38:17.722
That's unbelievable.

1:38:18.893 --> 1:38:22.056
[sighs]
Now, Detective,

1:38:22.230 --> 1:38:24.392
you get to judge.

1:38:26.067 --> 1:38:29.731
So, tell me...

1:38:29.904 --> 1:38:31.929
what am I?

1:38:33.007 --> 1:38:34.668
Mm, am I...

1:38:34.842 --> 1:38:35.968
a machine?

1:38:36.177 --> 1:38:38.441
Am I a person?

1:38:38.613 --> 1:38:41.105
Am I a war hero?

1:38:43.151 --> 1:38:45.779
Am I a criminal?

1:38:49.056 --> 1:38:51.286
I can't judge you.

1:38:54.061 --> 1:38:56.393
Well, then...

1:38:58.900 --> 1:39:02.234
...you're no help to me at all.

1:39:03.805 --> 1:39:05.967
- [knocking]
- [headmaster] Come in.

1:39:06.140 --> 1:39:08.131
[door opens]

1:39:10.711 --> 1:39:12.941
You wanted to
see me, sir?

1:39:13.114 --> 1:39:15.014
Turing. Sit down.

1:39:15.216 --> 1:39:18.208
[children's playful shouts
in distance]

1:39:19.887 --> 1:39:21.821
[birds chirping]

1:39:26.794 --> 1:39:29.161
Something the matter?

1:39:29.330 --> 1:39:32.163
You and Christopher Morcom
are quite close.

1:39:32.333 --> 1:39:33.528
I wouldn't say that.

1:39:33.734 --> 1:39:35.133
Well, your
mathematics teacher

1:39:35.303 --> 1:39:37.397
says the two of you
are positively inseparable.

1:39:37.538 --> 1:39:39.734
We're the best students
in the class.

1:39:39.907 --> 1:39:42.274
He caught you passing notes
the other day.

1:39:42.443 --> 1:39:45.572
Cryptography, to pass the time.
The class is too simple.

1:39:45.746 --> 1:39:49.182
You and your friend solve maths
problems during maths class

1:39:49.350 --> 1:39:51.409
because the maths class
is too dull?

1:39:51.586 --> 1:39:53.418
He's not my friend.

1:39:53.588 --> 1:39:55.852
Well, I'm told
he's your only friend.

1:39:56.023 --> 1:39:57.650
Who said that?

1:40:00.027 --> 1:40:03.429
Something's come up
concerning Morcom.

1:40:03.598 --> 1:40:05.965
Why am I here?

1:40:08.102 --> 1:40:11.299
Christopher is dead.

1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:14.772

1:40:17.845 --> 1:40:19.711
I don't understand.

1:40:19.881 --> 1:40:21.872
His mother sent word
this morning.

1:40:22.049 --> 1:40:24.541
The family were
on holiday, you see.

1:40:28.523 --> 1:40:30.355
I don't understand.

1:40:30.525 --> 1:40:33.051
Well, he had
bovine tuberculosis,

1:40:33.227 --> 1:40:35.457
as I'm sure he told you.

1:40:35.630 --> 1:40:37.962
So this won't come
as a shock, but...

1:40:38.132 --> 1:40:40.226
still, all the same,

1:40:40.401 --> 1:40:42.995
I'm sorry.

1:40:43.170 --> 1:40:46.071
You're mistaken.

1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:48.709
Did he not tell you?

1:40:48.876 --> 1:40:51.504
Well, he's been sick
for a long time.

1:40:51.679 --> 1:40:54.205
He knew this
was coming soon.

1:40:54.382 --> 1:40:56.908
But he had a stiff
upper lip about it.

1:40:57.084 --> 1:40:59.576
Good lad.

1:40:59.754 --> 1:41:02.382
- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.

1:41:02.557 --> 1:41:05.254
Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.

1:41:05.426 --> 1:41:07.952
Ah. I see.

1:41:08.162 --> 1:41:10.096
Very well.

1:41:13.067 --> 1:41:15.593
May I leave, Headmaster?

1:42:04.652 --> 1:42:06.518
I would have come.

1:42:06.721 --> 1:42:08.485
I would have testified.

1:42:08.656 --> 1:42:11.148
And what would you have said,
that I, uh...

1:42:11.325 --> 1:42:13.384
I wasn't a homosexual.

1:42:13.561 --> 1:42:15.586
Alan... this is serious.

1:42:15.763 --> 1:42:17.094
They could send
you to jail.

Damn it.

- Alan.
- Uh...

1:42:28.175 --> 1:42:30.735
It's the medication.

1:42:30.911 --> 1:42:32.811
The medication?

1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:36.280
Uh, well, the judge
gave me, um, a choice...

1:42:36.450 --> 1:42:39.283
uh, ei-either
two years in prison

1:42:39.453 --> 1:42:42.150
or... ho-hormonal therapy.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

1:42:45.292 --> 1:42:47.124
Yes, yes, that's right.

Um, to, uh, to cure me
of my, um...

1:42:54.268 --> 1:42:56.430
Well, of course
I chose that.

1:42:59.306 --> 1:43:01.638

- I'm-I'm fine.

- No, I, uh, don't need your help,

Do you know,
this morning...

1:46:07.061 --> 1:46:10.122

if it wasn't for you.
