01:03.805 --> 01:07.322
It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years

01:07.347 --> 01:09.430
to reach a billion people.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.480
And then just, a hundred more
to reach 2 billion.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.742
And only 50 years
to double again...

01:14.767 --> 01:17.541
double again
to four billion in 1970.

01:17.565 --> 01:20.523
We're nearly at eight billion now.
Eight billion now.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.513
We are destroying the very means
by which life is substain.

01:23.538 --> 01:26.426
Every single global ill that plagues
the Earth can be traced back...

01:26.451 --> 01:30.372
traced back to human overpopulation...
human overpopulation.

01:30.397 --> 01:32.080
What didn't we demand any action?

01:32.105 --> 01:36.973
We clear-cut, we dump
we consume, we destroy.

01:36.998 --> 01:41.053
Half the animal species
on earth have vanished

01:41.093 --> 01:44.139
vanished for the last 40 years...
40 years.

01:44.164 --> 01:46.897
And still we keep attacking
our own environment!

01:46.922 --> 01:51.103
It doesn't take a catastrophe to learn our lesson...
A catastrophe to get our attention.

01:51.128 --> 01:53.619
Nothing changes behaviour like pain.

01:53.644 --> 01:56.392
Maybe pain can save us.

02:02.506 --> 02:04.506
There is a switch,

02:06.232 --> 02:08.053
if you throw it,

02:09.100 --> 02:11.849
half the people on earth will die.

02:12.925 --> 02:18.816
But if you don't, the human race
will be extinct in a hundred years.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.441
What would you do?

02:25.102 --> 02:30.037
Mankind is the cancer
in its own body.

02:31.422 --> 02:34.540
Do you love humanity
enough to save it?

02:36.291 --> 02:38.537
In case, they find me,

02:38.576 --> 02:40.718
I left you a path.

02:41.263 --> 02:43.354
The hardest one yet.

02:44.546 --> 02:47.521
Inferno will be at the end

02:47.879 --> 02:51.131
You are my contingency plan.

02:51.156 --> 02:54.618
You are humanity's final hope.

02:54.643 --> 02:58.770
Make sure Inferno is unleashed.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.040
Seek and find.

03:09.988 --> 03:14.386
Badia Fiorentina.

03:27.109 --> 03:29.293
A long road.

03:29.318 --> 03:31.474
But here we are.

03:33.806 --> 03:37.461
Better me, than the Americans.

03:40.879 --> 03:43.632
You're going to want to
tell me where it is.

03:45.012 --> 03:47.111
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.216
I know I will.

03:56.163 --> 03:57.297
Tell them,

03:57.322 --> 04:02.716
"Humanity is the disease,
Inferno is the cure."

04:39.307 --> 04:40.837
Traitor!

04:40.863 --> 04:44.496
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

04:46.749 --> 04:48.833
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

04:50.269 --> 04:51.761
Pay for your sins.

04:51.786 --> 04:54.490
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

04:54.515 --> 04:57.171
Ruined lost souls...

05:07.213 --> 05:09.515
- One moment, please.
- What is going...

05:09.540 --> 05:11.693
- What is happening?
- Dr. Brooks.

05:15.806 --> 05:17.918
Abandon all hope.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.878
All hope.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.195
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

05:40.370 --> 05:43.788
Mr. Langdon, I'm Dr. Brooks.

05:43.813 --> 05:47.192
I'm going to do a few checks,
nothing to worry about.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.099
Let's get rid of this, shall we?

05:57.773 --> 06:00.082
Do you know what day
of the week it is?

06:00.997 --> 06:02.384
Saturday.

06:02.410 --> 06:06.298
It's Monday, 28th of June.

06:06.323 --> 06:08.944
Monday, 28th of June.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.915
Do you know where we are?

06:11.867 --> 06:13.486
Boston.

06:14.938 --> 06:17.378
I'm at Mass General.

06:18.509 --> 06:22.340
And what's the last thing
you can remember?

06:24.786 --> 06:28.082
I uh...
I was on campus.

06:30.411 --> 06:34.305
Everything is blur.
It's out of focus.

06:36.587 --> 06:39.658
Was I in some kind
of an accident?

06:39.823 --> 06:41.703
We'll get to that.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.582
Is there someone
we should call for you?

06:44.717 --> 06:45.739
No.

06:45.764 --> 06:48.353
Your Wife?
Family?

06:48.378 --> 06:51.456
No. No.
I'm not married.

06:52.690 --> 06:55.665
Professor Langdon, you're suffering
from a head trauma.

06:55.690 --> 06:58.869
You appeared to have
a mild retrograde amnesia

06:59.026 --> 07:01.939
We've done a CT scan, there's no
evidence of intracranial bleeding.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.706
Which is very reassuring.
Non-terminal.

07:05.731 --> 07:07.977
Just try to relax.

07:08.002 --> 07:10.382
Neurologically, you seem to be fine.

07:10.407 --> 07:13.058
Your memory will return
over the next several days.

07:13.083 --> 07:16.236
So we'll...
we'll wait and watch.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.166
Could you turn off the lights please.

07:20.408 --> 07:21.778
Of course.

07:21.803 --> 07:24.628
If the head trauma was bad enough
to cause a cerebral contusion, then...

07:24.652 --> 07:27.832
Can you please-
Can you please turn off the lights?

07:30.862 --> 07:35.485
What am I... doing...
in Florence?

07:36.389 --> 07:41.006
That's Il Duomo.
That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?

07:41.031 --> 07:42.133
Yes.

07:42.159 --> 07:45.695
How...
How did I get here?

07:45.720 --> 07:49.489
You came to our emergency room
3 hours ago with a head wound.

07:55.926 --> 07:58.186
Was I...
Was I with a woman?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.482
No, a cab driver brought you in.

08:01.061 --> 08:04.758
No wallet. No phone.
No ID.

08:05.008 --> 08:07.563
How do you know my name?

08:09.044 --> 08:10.550
We've met.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.780
I saw your lecture at Imperial
College London, we spoke afterwards,

08:15.463 --> 08:17.623
you were very nice to me.

08:17.648 --> 08:19.187
We've met.

08:20.091 --> 08:21.840
Sorry, that's not quite fair.

08:21.865 --> 08:23.595
I was nine at that time.

08:23.620 --> 08:26.146
Wait.
Nine-nine years old?

08:26.171 --> 08:28.385
I was crazy about puzzles.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.511
And I like your books.

08:31.875 --> 08:36.425
Maybe not "Lost language of Ideograms",
but the others.

08:36.882 --> 08:37.985
Okay.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.795
I read them all.

08:40.482 --> 08:42.381
A weird kid.

08:43.727 --> 08:45.735
I was actually.

08:46.909 --> 08:48.500
Did I say that out loud?

08:48.525 --> 08:50.071
You did.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.834
Very sorry.

09:01.956 --> 09:06.053
Professor Langdon, your headaches
are going to be intense initially.

09:06.080 --> 09:10.026
And you can also expect
nausea, confusion and dizziness.

09:23.815 --> 09:25.777
That was the front desk.

09:26.227 --> 09:28.546
The police are here to see you.

09:28.852 --> 09:30.202
Me, why?

09:30.227 --> 09:33.719
Before you talk to them, Professor Langdon,
you should know the facts of your case.

09:33.744 --> 09:35.496
Your head wound was not
caused by an accident.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.517
It was the result of a gunshot.

09:37.542 --> 09:40.480
A bullet grazed the top of your skull
and you most likely took a bad fall

09:40.505 --> 09:42.172
which is what caused the concussion.

09:42.197 --> 09:44.775
If the bullet had been
an inch to the side,

09:44.800 --> 09:47.469
it could have killed you.

10:19.317 --> 10:20.846
Come on.
Come on.

10:38.902 --> 10:41.444
This way.
This way, come on.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.956
Taxi.

11:20.892 --> 11:22.360
Get in.

11:25.835 --> 11:27.987
Is he drunk or what?

11:29.464 --> 11:31.267
What was that?

11:32.311 --> 11:33.810
Drive!

11:38.579 --> 11:39.618
Drive! Drive!

11:39.643 --> 11:42.133
- What's going on?
- No idea.

11:45.559 --> 11:47.480
This is going to hurt.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.339
It's okay.
It's okay.

11:56.364 --> 11:58.074
Robert.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.184
Seek and find.

12:34.808 --> 12:37.617
Seek and find.

12:49.321 --> 12:51.330
This is my apartment.

12:53.509 --> 12:55.506
You're still in Florence.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.904
I'm going to call the police.

12:59.929 --> 13:03.677
Wait.
That policewoman just tried to kill us.

13:03.702 --> 13:04.692
Okay.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.011
We'll call the U.S. Consulate
instead if you like.

13:07.051 --> 13:10.982
Just... wait.
Just give me... give me a minute.

13:11.890 --> 13:12.998
Get a hold on things.

13:13.023 --> 13:15.435
Why was someone shooting at you?

13:15.460 --> 13:16.817
I don't know.

13:16.842 --> 13:18.646
Also, when you came into ER,

13:18.671 --> 13:21.432
you were mumbling
something over and over.

13:21.457 --> 13:22.752
Sorry

13:22.777 --> 13:27.018
Ve sorr...
Ve sorry.

13:27.859 --> 13:29.673
'Very sorry'?

13:37.033 --> 13:39.624
Do you have any idea
why you would be saying this?

13:40.129 --> 13:42.246
- No.
- Why was someone shooting at you?

13:42.271 --> 13:44.614
You can keep asking me
these questions, lady.

13:44.639 --> 13:46.148
But I'm not going to
know the answers!

13:46.173 --> 13:47.945
My name is Sienna.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.516
I'm sorry.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.126
Hello.

13:57.158 --> 13:58.491
Hi.

13:58.994 --> 14:00.534
You asked a lot of questions.

14:00.559 --> 14:02.869
Yeah, I'm feeling a tad
vulnerable right now.

14:02.894 --> 14:05.852
I'm with someone
other people want to shoot at!

14:05.920 --> 14:07.682
I'm sorry.

14:09.486 --> 14:11.651
Questions are important.

14:11.677 --> 14:13.659
It will help you recover.

14:14.358 --> 14:19.179
Can I ask you for a...
cup of a...

14:19.724 --> 14:23.488
It's... It's... It's...
Um.

14:23.970 --> 14:27.536
What is brown and
it's hot and...

14:27.561 --> 14:31.155
People drink it in the morning
for energy. Uh...

14:31.234 --> 14:33.567
- Tea.
- Tea. No. The other one.

14:33.592 --> 14:35.480
- Coffee.
- Coffee!

14:35.652 --> 14:38.012
Could I have a cup of coffee?

14:39.027 --> 14:40.417
Sure.

14:40.892 --> 14:42.394
Thank you.

14:48.161 --> 14:50.378
You are very organized.

14:50.796 --> 14:52.971
I like things tidy.

14:53.903 --> 14:57.280
Thank you for helping me
at the hospital.

14:57.305 --> 14:59.380
That was very courageous.

14:59.405 --> 15:01.526
It's just reflexes.

15:02.977 --> 15:04.765
Very sorry.

15:08.744 --> 15:10.395
Very...

15:14.716 --> 15:16.732
sorry.

15:27.621 --> 15:29.969
I feel I'm having visions.

15:29.994 --> 15:31.920
It's the head trauma.

15:32.526 --> 15:35.261
You won't be able to trust
your own thoughts for a while.

15:36.994 --> 15:39.845
I saw a plague mask.

15:39.870 --> 15:44.329
It's the kind the medieval doctors
wore in... during the Black death.

15:44.354 --> 15:46.514
You said something about that.

15:46.538 --> 15:50.245
You were talking in the cab
it was mostly incoherent but...

15:50.270 --> 15:52.765
But I did hear the word mask.

15:53.298 --> 15:55.154
Anything else?

15:55.179 --> 15:59.748
The bodies,
the blood and fire and...

16:00.150 --> 16:01.983
and hell.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.932
And there's a woman.

16:08.253 --> 16:10.601
Yeah, there's a woman,
and she seemed...

16:10.625 --> 16:12.850
Seek and find.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.713
Uh.
Well, seemed so dangerous.

16:15.738 --> 16:18.352
No, you got to have somebody
we should call.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.190
I do?
Why?

16:25.640 --> 16:27.641
My wat...
Was I wearing

16:27.830 --> 16:29.806
my watch when I was
brought to the hospital?

16:29.831 --> 16:31.248
No.

16:36.808 --> 16:38.798
You weren't wearing a watch.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.577
It's important to me.
It was a gift from my parents.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.134
Look, you should
go ahead and clean up.

16:45.725 --> 16:49.634
Your clothes are covered in blood but
I think I got something that might fit you.

16:49.761 --> 16:53.092
Once you get dressed,
we'll call the police, okay?

16:53.117 --> 16:56.619
No. No.
The Consulate.

16:57.163 --> 17:00.529
Right.
The Consulate.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.626
Coffee.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.803
Ignazio Busoni: I PRAY YOU ARE ALL RIGHT

17:51.828 --> 17:53.657
Ignazio?

18:00.373 --> 18:03.949
Safely hidden, as am I.
Paradie Twenty-five.

18:03.974 --> 18:07.228
Now they're after me too.

18:07.779 --> 18:09.695
What we stole

18:09.720 --> 18:14.187
is safely hidden, as am I.

18:14.957 --> 18:16.628
"What we stole"?

18:16.653 --> 18:20.364
Paradise Twenty-five.

18:26.226 --> 18:28.008
Ignazio.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.854
I've left your things
in the bathroom.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.067
Try these.

18:50.347 --> 18:51.896
Whose are they?

18:52.415 --> 18:53.796
A friend's.

18:53.821 --> 18:55.581
Does he live here?

18:55.608 --> 18:56.743
Sometimes.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.221
Oh.
Sometimes, huh.

18:59.377 --> 19:01.006
You're being rude.

19:01.031 --> 19:02.328
I'm sorry.

19:02.353 --> 19:04.492
I'm sorry, I'm not like this.

19:04.517 --> 19:06.406
You kind of are.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.215
I found this in my old jacket.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.150
It's a biotube.

20:01.175 --> 20:04.418
They're used for transporting
dangerous substances.

20:04.547 --> 20:06.009
What are you doing with it?

20:06.034 --> 20:07.866
I have no idea.

20:08.070 --> 20:10.313
It's a high end unit.

20:11.532 --> 20:13.477
Government issue.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.991
It's called thumbprint recognition.
Security in case it's lost or stolen.

20:18.016 --> 20:22.668
Tubes like this can only be opened
by a specified individual.

20:23.585 --> 20:24.812
Well, it sure hell isn't me.

20:24.837 --> 20:27.146
- Then why do you have it?
- I don't know.

20:27.171 --> 20:29.322
I'm getting the number
for the Consulate.

20:29.347 --> 20:31.242
No, please.
Wait.

20:31.267 --> 20:34.503
I have waited.
This isn't right.

20:34.528 --> 20:35.984
Why do you have it?
Where did you get it?

20:36.008 --> 20:37.499
Look, there is a simple way

20:37.524 --> 20:39.513
to find out if this thing
belongs to me.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.220
Then my thumb will open it
or it won't.

20:41.245 --> 20:42.783
Open it, are you insane?

20:42.808 --> 20:46.183
If it's a viral agent,
will it be released if I opened it?

20:47.288 --> 20:48.802
No.

20:49.895 --> 20:52.838
No, there'll be an inner sleeve
maybe even two.

20:54.118 --> 20:57.105
Before I put myself in anyone's hands
I want to know what this thing is.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.446
Uh, and what I'm involved with.

21:00.954 --> 21:03.160
That make sense, doesn't it?

21:03.488 --> 21:05.059
Yes.

21:05.926 --> 21:08.167
So, we agree.

21:08.891 --> 21:10.659
We're opening it.

21:31.451 --> 21:33.971
Well, that explains
that it is mine.

21:34.647 --> 21:39.267
This is a cylinder seal
made of ivory.

21:39.292 --> 21:40.833
No.

21:42.496 --> 21:44.275
It's bone.

21:44.681 --> 21:46.170
Human.

21:48.481 --> 21:51.416
Three-headed, man eating Satan.

21:51.441 --> 21:54.192
A common image from the Middle Ages

21:54.217 --> 21:57.103
associated with the Black Plague.

21:57.130 --> 21:59.383
The 3 gnashing mouths
are symbolic of

21:59.408 --> 22:02.078
how effectively the plague ate
through the population.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.910
Yet you can't remember
the word for coffee.

22:06.070 --> 22:09.297
It explains my visions, sort of.

22:12.425 --> 22:14.461
- Do you hear that?
- Mm-mm.

22:14.486 --> 22:17.200
This could be a Faraday pointer.

22:23.890 --> 22:26.704
So why-why this, huh?

22:40.582 --> 22:42.504
It's Botticelli.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.473
It's his map of hell.

22:44.498 --> 22:48.211
He painted it as an
illustration of Dante's Inferno.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.216
I studied Dante
when I was younger.

22:51.599 --> 22:53.202
Probably in kindergarden.

22:53.227 --> 22:54.741
I was a bit obsessed.

22:54.766 --> 22:58.817
Dante defined our modern
conception of hell.

22:58.842 --> 23:03.036
Our vision of it hasn't changed
since he defined it 700 years ago.

23:03.061 --> 23:08.768
Botticelli drew it but...
Dante created hell as we know it.

23:09.111 --> 23:11.624
This is what I have been seeing.

23:11.869 --> 23:13.965
Torment.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.904
Sinners.

23:15.998 --> 23:18.026
Branding with letters..

23:18.051 --> 23:21.186
Liars, covered with rashes.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.174
Soothsayers with their heads
ripped backwards.

23:24.199 --> 23:27.495
- Serpents.
- The punishment for thievery.

23:28.221 --> 23:31.134
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.859
So you have no idea
why you have this?

23:35.614 --> 23:38.365
I think maybe
we call the consulate now.

23:38.390 --> 23:39.778
Right.

23:42.981 --> 23:44.330
Professor Langdon?

23:44.355 --> 23:47.417
Hello, yes.
Speaking.

23:47.442 --> 23:50.803
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.

23:51.201 --> 23:52.956
You have?

23:52.981 --> 23:55.016
Are you still in possession?

23:56.507 --> 23:59.624
Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?

23:59.808 --> 24:02.641
- Yes.
- Where are you located?

24:03.042 --> 24:06.550
Professor, we can't help you
if we can't find you.

24:07.211 --> 24:09.051
If that's the consulate,
how do they know?

24:09.076 --> 24:10.806
Because they know.

24:14.140 --> 24:15.689
What do we do?

24:18.384 --> 24:20.297
Tell them you're over there.

24:27.380 --> 24:29.356
- Hello.
- Professor, we were cut off.

24:29.381 --> 24:31.156
Yes, sorry.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.359
Where are you located?

24:32.384 --> 24:37.097
I'm at a hotel,
Pensione la Fiorentina.

24:37.122 --> 24:39.720
Stay in your room.
We're sending someone now.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.240
I'll wait here, room 39.

24:44.992 --> 24:48.573
Okay.
We wait and see who they send.

24:54.867 --> 24:58.833
Langdon accessed his email account from
an unmasked IP address here in Florence

24:58.858 --> 25:00.839
- When?
- 7 minutes ago.

25:00.864 --> 25:03.870
Via Dolorosa, number 12,
apartment 3C.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.636
Via Dolorosa, how long?

25:05.661 --> 25:06.583
12 minutes.

25:06.608 --> 25:09.192
Go! I want that pointer back
and I want Langdon.

25:09.217 --> 25:10.838
Whatever it takes, let's get him.

25:10.863 --> 25:12.873
Go, go, go, go, now!

25:19.263 --> 25:22.196
Look at this.
This is odd.

25:22.374 --> 25:25.010
This area here, this is
Dante's 8th level of hell.

25:25.035 --> 25:27.940
It's called the Malebolge,
means evil ditches.

25:27.965 --> 25:29.614
There's ten of them.

25:29.639 --> 25:35.437
This letter "R" here,
is not in the original painting.

25:35.462 --> 25:37.365
It's been added.

25:37.695 --> 25:39.520
There's another one.

25:39.648 --> 25:41.690
- Where?
- An "E".

25:41.715 --> 25:43.362
On seducers whipped by demons.

25:43.386 --> 25:45.839
- There's a "C" on the cheek of a...
- A grafter.

25:45.865 --> 25:48.528
- A grafter.
- A conman trapped in a pool of boiling tar.

25:48.553 --> 25:51.320
- A "V", "R".
- Ah, there.

25:51.345 --> 25:54.005
- "T".
- There, there, "A".

25:55.072 --> 25:55.977
What is that.

25:56.002 --> 25:58.398
That's text.
Is that in English?

25:58.936 --> 26:07.877
THE TRUTH CAN BE GLIMPSED ONLY
THROUGH THE EYES OF DEATH.

26:09.518 --> 26:11.245
ZOBRIST.

26:15.214 --> 26:16.965
Bertrand Zobrist.

26:16.990 --> 26:20.466
- American billionaire, that must be nice.
- Hm.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.289
Bioengineer

26:22.314 --> 26:25.408
Notorious for radical views.

26:25.433 --> 26:27.070
Here he is.

26:29.473 --> 26:33.480
It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years

26:33.505 --> 26:35.404
to reach a billion people.

26:35.982 --> 26:40.092
And then just a hundred more
to reach two billion.

26:40.258 --> 26:46.645
And only fifty years to double again
to four billion people in 1970.

26:47.756 --> 26:51.749
We're nearly at eight billion now.

26:51.877 --> 26:56.242
Bartlett used the example of a beaker.

26:56.267 --> 26:57.793
With a single bacterium.

26:57.818 --> 27:01.149
One that divides
and doubles every minute.

27:01.174 --> 27:04.884
If you placed the first bacterium
into the beaker at 11 o'clock.

27:04.909 --> 27:08.241
And it's completely full by 12.

27:08.266 --> 27:12.682
At what time is the beaker
still only half full?

27:13.219 --> 27:15.114
11:59.

27:17.095 --> 27:19.190
That's what time it is for us.

27:19.424 --> 27:26.384
In 40 years,
32 billion people... will fight to survive.

27:27.638 --> 27:29.159
No fail.

27:31.453 --> 27:33.648
We're a minute to midnight.

27:33.871 --> 27:39.773
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth
can be traced back to human overpopulation.

27:39.797 --> 27:43.932
But serious birth control measures
they don't stand a chance.

27:44.294 --> 27:47.332
Outrageous!
Violation of my rights!

27:47.357 --> 27:51.722
Invasion of my privacy!
Don't tell me what to do!

27:51.747 --> 27:55.912
And still we keep attacking
our own environment!

27:55.937 --> 28:02.442
They have been 5 major extinctions
in the earth's history.

28:02.924 --> 28:07.845
Unless we take bold immediate action

28:07.870 --> 28:13.449
the sixth extinction
will be our own.

28:16.063 --> 28:18.384
We're a minute to midnight.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.436
Looks like he's got
a lot of followers.

28:21.461 --> 28:24.196
Yeah, from all over the world.

28:26.927 --> 28:29.054
He is compelling.

28:29.509 --> 28:33.659
The 2 year disappearance during which
some authorities feared Zobrist

28:33.684 --> 28:37.867
may have designed
an opportunistic viral pathogen.

28:38.053 --> 28:40.366
He created a plague.

28:43.106 --> 28:44.845
But, why Dante?

28:44.870 --> 28:46.420
Why this map of hell?

28:46.445 --> 28:49.411
Is this supposed to be a puzzle
or a challenge?

28:49.436 --> 28:51.647
Or a suicide note.

28:52.416 --> 28:55.032
He killed himself 3 days ago.

29:03.273 --> 29:04.832
The levels.

29:06.451 --> 29:09.653
The levels are out of order,
that's what's been bothering me.

29:09.678 --> 29:12.880
The circles of hell
had been rearranged.

29:12.905 --> 29:15.437
It's the same woman
from the hospital.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.878
We can't stay here.
And we certainly can't trust the Consulate.

29:18.902 --> 29:20.989
Flatters are dipping in excrement,
that's not right.

29:21.015 --> 29:23.458
If the plague exist, do you know
how many governments would want it?

29:23.482 --> 29:25.155
Clerical profiteers, not there.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.294
- What they would do to get it.
- Someone who discord dead, no.

29:27.318 --> 29:29.355
A biological weapon.

29:29.856 --> 29:31.429
The letters.

29:33.408 --> 29:37.636
He has assigned a letter to each sin
and then changed their order.

29:37.661 --> 29:39.523
He's made an anagram.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.827
Yes.
Anagram!

29:47.962 --> 29:50.817
Let's go.
I know another way out.

29:57.570 --> 30:00.145
If you have phoned,
best leave it here.

30:00.170 --> 30:01.450
They might track it.

30:01.475 --> 30:05.159
The phone?
I'm not even wearing my own clothes.

30:05.184 --> 30:07.957
Good.
Let's go.

30:12.648 --> 30:15.182
(What the hell are THEY doing here?!)

30:17.456 --> 30:20.529
Robert Langdon!
World Health Organization!

30:24.690 --> 30:26.888
V, R, O.

30:27.251 --> 30:30.373
I got to rearrange these letters,
OVER, CODE,

30:30.398 --> 30:32.437
COVERED, CAT

30:32.462 --> 30:35.491
God.
I used to be good at this.

30:39.746 --> 30:41.777
Cerca trova.

30:42.291 --> 30:45.546
It's Italian.
It means "seek" and "find".

30:46.253 --> 30:48.893
Cerca trova.
Yes!

30:50.014 --> 30:52.638
I know why I am in Florence.

30:57.385 --> 31:00.510
World Health Organization
has landed, standby.

31:05.557 --> 31:06.620
Be advised.

31:06.645 --> 31:10.208
Agent Bouchard, from the
Paris office is already here.

31:15.344 --> 31:17.533
W.H.O, bring me up to speed.

31:17.558 --> 31:19.399
Bouchard is up there now.

31:43.446 --> 31:47.204
- Where are we going?
- The Palazzo Vecchio, near the Boboli Gardens.

32:01.604 --> 32:02.925
There's no sign of him.

32:02.950 --> 32:05.478
Bouchard says Langdon is gone
and so is the pointer.

32:05.503 --> 32:06.863
Well, I need better.

32:06.888 --> 32:09.953
I need better from you,
from you, from all of us.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.493
Better!

32:11.518 --> 32:15.682
Work faster. Work smarter.
Don't trust anyone.

32:16.585 --> 32:18.256
Let's do that.

32:19.091 --> 32:20.849
- Less trouble.
- Yes.

32:33.884 --> 32:36.455
The information seems to be obsolete.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.121
Do not say anything
to the secretary general.

32:42.641 --> 32:45.384
- Identification.
- Vayentha.

32:45.409 --> 32:48.564
- Go ahead.
- I need to speak to the provost.

32:48.589 --> 32:50.052
Hold on.

32:50.077 --> 32:53.446
The Mendacium.

32:59.182 --> 33:02.570
So, the WHO beat you to
Mr. Langdon, Vayentha.

33:02.595 --> 33:04.140
The provost isn't going to like that.

33:04.164 --> 33:06.702
I know him.
He's going to want to liquidate.

33:06.727 --> 33:08.317
Tell him this isn't Berlin.

33:08.342 --> 33:10.574
He tries anything
and I will find him.

33:10.599 --> 33:13.608
Try to reacquire and
make contact in 60 minutes.

33:13.633 --> 33:16.089
Did you hear me?
I am not disposable.

33:16.114 --> 33:20.989
Vayentha, get the Faraday pointer
before the government does.

33:21.345 --> 33:22.642
Shit.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.198
- Mr. Sims.
- Mm.

33:47.223 --> 33:49.418
There's been a deviation.

33:49.563 --> 33:50.777
Sorry to hear that.

33:50.802 --> 33:52.956
- What operation?
- Florence.

33:52.988 --> 33:56.128
Our new players seemed
to have gone off script.

33:56.153 --> 33:59.060
How unprofessional.

33:59.085 --> 34:04.079
And now the WHO has
overtaken our position.

34:08.673 --> 34:11.544
Tell Vayentha,
if she values her position

34:11.569 --> 34:13.348
she will remove Langdon.

34:13.373 --> 34:15.499
Body not found.

34:15.524 --> 34:18.061
Or better yet,
a mugging gone awry.

34:18.086 --> 34:21.785
A blade, I think.
Cash gone, wallet remains.

34:21.810 --> 34:26.381
Let's have a quick identification
and move on. Move on, move on.

34:27.939 --> 34:31.312
Professor Langdon is
out of frame.

34:36.946 --> 34:40.006
- And in possession of the tube?
- Yes.

34:40.031 --> 34:42.499
He has the Faraday pointer.

34:46.238 --> 34:49.104
He was such a good frame.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.433
- What is Vayentha's condition?
- Intact but anxious.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.045
She should be.

34:58.146 --> 35:01.653
What in god's name
has this client gotten us into?

35:01.679 --> 35:05.404
No, no, no.
This is uh... rhetorical.

35:07.619 --> 35:10.055
When are we due to receive
the client's video?

35:10.826 --> 35:12.150
It just arrived.

35:12.175 --> 35:14.527
His instructions were to
upload it in 24 hours.

35:14.552 --> 35:15.990
I want to look at it now.

35:16.015 --> 35:17.621
But, the client, Mr. Zobrist.

35:17.646 --> 35:20.969
The client, client, is dead.
I want to see the video.

35:20.994 --> 35:24.566
That's a violation of our protocols.

35:28.753 --> 35:32.054
We're not the government.
We get things done.

35:32.079 --> 35:33.924
Mr. Arbogast.

35:34.536 --> 35:38.704
Chief among the attributes that makes us
so very good at our job

35:38.729 --> 35:42.429
is that as far as the world
is concerned, we don't exist.

35:42.454 --> 35:46.208
If this video implicates or
even mentions us in anyway,

35:46.234 --> 35:49.922
I want to stop it's release.
For the benefit of all our clients.

35:49.947 --> 35:52.740
You asked me to avoid abnormalities
in procedure, that's all.

35:52.765 --> 35:57.022
What about Mr. Zobrist
has ever remotely resembled normal.

35:57.047 --> 35:59.867
- Well, I...
- Also rhetorical.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.663
Bring me the video.

36:04.198 --> 36:07.170
In the Vecchio's Hall of the
Five Hundred, there's a famous mural,

36:07.195 --> 36:09.667
Giorgio Vasari's Battle of Marciano.

36:09.692 --> 36:12.606
Near the top of the mural
is a coded message

36:12.631 --> 36:14.425
which is one the art world's
most famous puzzles.

36:14.449 --> 36:15.823
And what's the message?

36:15.848 --> 36:17.536
Cerca trova.

36:18.241 --> 36:20.061
Seek and find.

36:20.086 --> 36:22.195
At the hospital,
I kept saying I was sorry.

36:22.220 --> 36:23.619
Very sorry, over and over.

36:23.644 --> 36:25.187
Well, maybe that's not
what I meant.

36:25.212 --> 36:27.897
The name of the artist, Vasari.
I could have been saying Vasari.

36:27.922 --> 36:31.034
That's good.
You seem clearer.

36:31.059 --> 36:33.634
- I am.
- What's your middle name?

36:34.831 --> 36:36.597
Well, I am.

36:36.988 --> 36:38.439
Mm-hm.

36:38.673 --> 36:41.599
Zobrist is dead
but if his plague is real...

36:41.623 --> 36:46.553
Then this map is a trail
he has left so someone can find it.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.063
Who?

36:48.088 --> 36:51.002
Well, someone who believes
the same as he does.

36:51.027 --> 36:52.379
And that's why you have it.

36:52.404 --> 36:54.028
Well, I don't remember
ever meeting Zobrist.

36:54.052 --> 36:56.071
There's a lot you don't remember.

36:56.392 --> 36:59.673
Maybe they-
Maybe they came to you.

37:00.579 --> 37:02.195
Wanted your help with the path.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.188
- Because I lectured on Dante?
- Exactly.

37:04.213 --> 37:08.458
They showed you this Faraday pointer,
tried to convince you of their cause.

37:08.483 --> 37:11.035
- Mass murder?
- You said you found him compelling.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.625
His argument!

37:12.650 --> 37:14.011
His rhetoric.

37:14.421 --> 37:16.659
Not his plan!
Zobrist is a psychopath.

37:16.684 --> 37:18.203
Well, maybe they tricked you.

37:18.228 --> 37:20.825
Sent...
someone you knew.

37:21.205 --> 37:24.140
It's a minute to midnight.

37:30.442 --> 37:33.470
- Is that for us?
- Logic would suggest.

37:47.886 --> 37:49.442
Damn it!

37:51.218 --> 37:53.249
Here, come on.
Follow me.

37:53.274 --> 37:55.039
We could get there
through the garden.

38:03.395 --> 38:06.992
Okay, the-
the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.

38:11.417 --> 38:15.033
We just flagged the car charged to
her credit card within the past hour.

38:15.058 --> 38:16.842
Antoine, did you talk to the police?

38:16.867 --> 38:18.904
There are people who have seen me.

38:18.929 --> 38:22.777
Please cooperate with
local police officially.

38:26.413 --> 38:31.352
W.H.O. will take charge overseeing
the search at the Boboli Gardens.

38:34.586 --> 38:36.982
Call in the search dogs.

38:37.006 --> 38:43.210
I got called out from the
police station to support you.

38:53.391 --> 38:55.560
I need more people.

39:02.817 --> 39:05.899
Radio in, suspects found.

39:24.318 --> 39:27.740
Damn it!
Delta, check the north perimeter.

39:29.999 --> 39:31.745
There's a small gray door
down here.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.850
It will take us into
the Vasari corridor.

39:33.875 --> 39:37.835
Right across the Ponte Vecchio,
and into the Palazzo.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.483
- That's the door, see.
- Yeah.

39:39.508 --> 39:40.744
Now!

39:57.281 --> 39:59.032
Is the completely walled.

39:59.057 --> 40:00.403
On all sides.

40:00.428 --> 40:03.539
The only exits are through the Palazzo
Pitti, on the north side,

40:03.564 --> 40:06.186
and through the visitors gates
on the east and west sides.

40:06.211 --> 40:07.289
No other way out?

40:07.314 --> 40:09.449
I suppose if you count
the Vasari gate.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.054
But it's ancient,
no one knows about that.

40:12.079 --> 40:13.761
Langdon does.

40:21.966 --> 40:24.807
The Professor has become
a liability, Vayentha.

40:24.832 --> 40:29.387
The provost has issued a kill order.
Eliminate Langdon.

40:29.411 --> 40:33.865
Fail, and you will be held accountable.
Am I making myself clear?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.771
Copy that, sir.

40:53.598 --> 40:54.641
There.

40:54.681 --> 40:58.581
That's the Vasari fresco,
The Battle of Marciano.

41:37.811 --> 41:40.637
There. There.
Look. Look, look, look.

41:41.485 --> 41:44.370
Okay, see the 2 farmhouses,
dead center up high,

41:44.395 --> 41:46.127
come down to it's 4 o'clock,

41:46.152 --> 41:48.753
and you'll see a small green flag.

41:48.778 --> 41:50.872
- Cerca trova.
- Yeah.

41:50.897 --> 41:52.180
Seek and find.

41:52.205 --> 41:55.056
Seek and find.

41:55.081 --> 41:57.559
We sought it and we found it.

41:57.584 --> 41:59.560
So, now what?

41:59.670 --> 42:01.946
The words Zobrist
added to the painting.

42:01.971 --> 42:05.889
The truth can be glimpsed
only through the eyes of death.

42:07.045 --> 42:08.765
Eyes of death.

42:10.076 --> 42:11.920
Whose's eyes?

42:51.057 --> 42:53.021
Was I given an injection?

42:53.046 --> 42:53.926
When?

42:53.951 --> 42:56.559
- At the hospital, with a hypertenol?
- No.

42:56.584 --> 43:00.208
No, you were intubated.
Anything you got came through the IV.

43:01.497 --> 43:03.517
Not at the hospital.

43:03.862 --> 43:07.205
I was fully dress.
I was in the back of some car...

43:07.230 --> 43:09.486
at some point
in the last 2 days.

43:09.511 --> 43:11.899
And something was injected
into my bloodstream.

43:11.924 --> 43:14.715
And now I'm showing
signs of an illness

43:17.415 --> 43:18.903
What if...?

43:20.468 --> 43:22.205
What if what?

43:24.254 --> 43:26.654
Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?

43:28.194 --> 43:29.592
Look.

43:30.663 --> 43:33.253
If you've got it
then I've got it too.

43:33.278 --> 43:37.107
And everyone we've come into
contact with has it and will likely die.

43:37.132 --> 43:38.322
But if you don't.

43:38.347 --> 43:42.785
If-If they gave you an anotic
or a hallucinogen or anything else.

43:43.269 --> 43:46.473
Then we still have a chance
to save half the world.

43:47.806 --> 43:50.002
It's worth a try, isn't it?

43:58.913 --> 44:00.421
Professor.

44:01.707 --> 44:05.744
Ah, it is you.
Why are you back so soon?

44:06.286 --> 44:08.751
I have no idea
who this woman is.

44:08.776 --> 44:13.191
I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.
You've been shopping?

44:15.151 --> 44:17.437
Professor, you bumped your head.

44:17.462 --> 44:21.277
In the shower, yes.
It's quite a tumble.

44:21.302 --> 44:22.319
- Ayes.
- Yeah.

44:22.343 --> 44:26.411
I'm sorry.
This is Sienna, my niece.

44:26.436 --> 44:30.246
You're in Italy, Professor,
you don't have to say 'niece'.

44:30.271 --> 44:31.746
- No. No.
- No, he's not.

44:31.771 --> 44:36.095
Hello.
Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.

44:36.318 --> 44:38.777
Is Ignazio with you again?

44:39.139 --> 44:41.587
- Ignazio?
- Yeah.

44:50.397 --> 44:53.188
Ignazio couldn't make it
this morning.

44:53.213 --> 44:57.312
I'm sorry to bother you, Marta.
But...

44:57.337 --> 45:02.923
I can imagine you know why
I'm back. Again.

45:03.312 --> 45:04.853
Really?

45:05.163 --> 45:08.086
Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.

45:08.111 --> 45:12.535
He and il Duomino spent almost an hour
with it up there last night.

45:12.621 --> 45:15.554
It's-It's so morbid.

45:15.579 --> 45:18.852
No. No.
It's cool.

45:18.877 --> 45:22.501
Alright, come on.
I'm headed up that way.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.627
He's an extremely resourceful man.

45:31.652 --> 45:34.693
I was told you were
as well, Mr. Bouchard.

45:38.024 --> 45:40.255
So.
Tell me.

45:40.266 --> 45:41.706
What do you think he's doing?

45:41.731 --> 45:43.116
What you think you doing?

45:43.141 --> 45:45.336
I brought you the pointer
and now it's gone.

45:45.361 --> 45:47.566
- You have a leak.
- We losed him in the street.

45:47.591 --> 45:49.587
Reacquired him at the doctor's apartment.

45:49.612 --> 45:51.302
I can handle with some ground.

45:51.327 --> 45:53.985
- We don't need your help.
- What if he's injured.

45:55.245 --> 45:56.989
A head wound.

45:57.227 --> 45:58.579
What?
You think he's confused.

45:58.604 --> 46:01.192
- He doesn't know what he's doing?
- It's possible.

46:01.217 --> 46:04.729
How far did he get
the night before he disappeared?

46:04.754 --> 46:06.854
To the Hall of Five Hundred.

46:08.422 --> 46:10.414
So let's stop chasing him,

46:10.915 --> 46:13.196
anticipate him instead.

46:25.164 --> 46:28.337
Whoa, inspector.
Not so fast, please.

46:28.406 --> 46:30.521
I'm about to burst.

46:30.546 --> 46:33.764
Such a romantic date he takes you on.
To see a death mask.

46:33.789 --> 46:36.482
Yeah, they were common practice
in the 1500s.

46:36.507 --> 46:40.467
It's essentially just a
plaster cast of someone's face,

46:40.492 --> 46:43.762
made a few moments
after that person dies.

46:44.069 --> 46:45.679
"Through the eyes of death."

46:45.712 --> 46:49.806
The person who was used for this mask,
the poet,

46:50.112 --> 46:51.878
Dante.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.886
It is a romantic story I supposed.

46:55.911 --> 46:59.865
Dante loved Florence,
he was prominent and powerful. But...

46:59.890 --> 47:02.760
The political winds changed
and he was exiled.

47:02.785 --> 47:06.058
They threatened to burn him
at the stake if he ever returned.

47:06.083 --> 47:12.246
Actually, some people say Dante's exile
is the reason his death mask looks so sad.

47:12.289 --> 47:16.370
No. No.
It was because of Beatrice.

47:16.395 --> 47:20.732
Dante only knew her from afar but
he was obsessed with her his entire life.

47:21.177 --> 47:24.101
Your niece is a romantic, Professor.

47:24.456 --> 47:29.404
They say Dante wrote in fact about
his journey out of hell to reach her.

47:29.446 --> 47:31.409
But he never made it.

47:32.132 --> 47:34.420
She married someone else.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.435
That happens.

47:36.460 --> 47:37.904
Does it?

47:38.186 --> 47:40.069
Who left who?

47:40.094 --> 47:42.881
Things fall apart if
you don't look after them.

47:42.906 --> 47:46.373
Oh. We ask that you stay
behind the stanchions. Please.

47:46.398 --> 47:47.243
Thank you.

47:47.268 --> 47:50.374
Good timing, Professor.
We've only just opened.

47:55.023 --> 47:56.201
Marta...

47:56.226 --> 47:57.735
Yes?

48:32.860 --> 48:34.552
There.
That's us.

48:38.466 --> 48:40.536
That's Ignazio Busoni.

48:40.779 --> 48:42.160
I've known him for years.

48:42.185 --> 48:44.573
He's the Dante scholar.

48:46.173 --> 48:50.311
The mask's owner insists on the
stanchions to keep people back.

48:50.336 --> 48:53.577
He doesn't even permit staff to open
the case without him present.

48:53.602 --> 48:56.495
So the mask is not owned
by the museum?

48:56.520 --> 48:58.542
No.
A private collector bought it from us,

48:58.567 --> 49:00.892
and allows us to
display it in perpetuity.

49:00.917 --> 49:04.590
It's a common practice,
to raise funds.

49:05.213 --> 49:06.467
Who is the collector?

49:06.492 --> 49:09.961
Bertram Zobrist, the billionaire.

49:09.986 --> 49:14.909
His ideas were quite eccentric,
but still it's such a shame what happened.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.960
That's when I got the call.

49:46.309 --> 49:47.623
Oh.

49:47.842 --> 49:51.014
Professor, I...
I don't know what to think!

49:51.039 --> 49:53.330
I am appalled!

50:03.974 --> 50:06.377
- Professor.
- Professor Langdon.

50:06.402 --> 50:09.653
Look.
There's an explanation for all this.

50:22.078 --> 50:23.286
I'll be right back.

50:23.311 --> 50:25.792
Marta, don't let them go.

50:43.431 --> 50:44.971
Professor.

50:44.996 --> 50:48.910
Professor, I very much respect you
but I do not understand.

50:48.935 --> 50:51.104
- Please sit down. I'm going to explain this.
- Why you have done this?

50:51.128 --> 50:53.929
- This is not okay.
- Marta, I do not know where the mask is.

50:53.954 --> 50:56.700
But I will do everything I can
to find it and return it to you.

50:56.725 --> 50:59.697
Professor, what are you doing?
Professor, please. No.

50:59.722 --> 51:02.179
Professor, come back.
Don't do that.

51:02.204 --> 51:03.579
Professor, please don't.

51:03.604 --> 51:04.703
- Hey. Hey.
- Professor.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.922
- Just don't follow us.
- Please, don't do this.

51:09.830 --> 51:11.539
Professor!

51:19.587 --> 51:22.469
Let's just calmly
find a way out of here.

51:27.334 --> 51:30.067
Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?

51:30.349 --> 51:32.698
Would you help me
if you knew I was a thief?

51:32.723 --> 51:34.320
You lied to me when
you asked for my help.

51:34.344 --> 51:36.523
Well technically, I withheld.

51:40.031 --> 51:41.463
If I really took that mask...

51:41.488 --> 51:43.108
You did take the mask,
I just saw you.

51:43.133 --> 51:46.747
This is not your problem.
You don't have to stay.

51:46.772 --> 51:49.972
Of course, I do.
Human lives are at stake.

51:49.997 --> 51:51.734
I just want to know that
I'm on the right side.

51:51.758 --> 51:53.133
You are.

51:53.757 --> 51:55.369
I swear.

51:55.553 --> 51:56.879
Good.

51:57.316 --> 51:59.719
Now let's find what
we're looking for.

52:00.001 --> 52:03.984
Call this Ignazio, and ask him
where he hid the mask.

52:09.222 --> 52:12.285
Ignazio's disappeared.
He had gone into hiding.

52:12.310 --> 52:13.319
He said.

52:13.344 --> 52:16.393
They were chasing him too
but he left a clue.

52:18.925 --> 52:21.714
An email,
"Paradise Twenty-five".

52:21.739 --> 52:25.162
That's a reference to Dante's
Divine Comedy. "Canto XXV." But...

52:25.187 --> 52:27.808
- I need a copy of the book.
- A copy of the book.

52:27.833 --> 52:30.892
That's quaint.
I use Google.

52:30.917 --> 52:34.283
They're closing down the museum,
only the main exit is going to be open.

52:34.643 --> 52:37.325
Well, then we'll go through Armenia.

53:03.522 --> 53:05.387
All exit doors are now sealed.

53:05.412 --> 53:07.190
This is the only way in or out.

53:07.215 --> 53:10.611
What about hidden exits?
Tunnels, concealed doorways?

53:10.636 --> 53:14.552
It's a 700 year old Palazzo, Signore,
there are a number of them.

53:14.577 --> 53:16.090
Show me.

53:34.093 --> 53:35.936
ARMENIA

53:41.044 --> 53:43.361
Professor.
How worldly.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.061
Secrets of the Palazzo Invisibile.

53:45.086 --> 53:47.846
It's a great tour,
you should take it sometime.

53:49.479 --> 53:51.852
We should be safe here
for a minute.

53:58.770 --> 54:00.090
Go.

54:04.242 --> 54:06.477
By then with other voice,
with other fleece...

54:06.502 --> 54:11.197
I shall return as poet and put on,
at my baptismal font, the laurel crown...

54:11.222 --> 54:12.252
Baptismal font.

54:12.277 --> 54:14.998
Il Duomo.
The Cathedral where Dante was baptized.

54:15.023 --> 54:18.939
That's where Ignazio works.
That's where he hid the mask.

54:24.488 --> 54:26.997
They're going to think
we're heading down to the exit.

54:28.938 --> 54:30.653
Then we go up.

54:47.353 --> 54:48.772
Alright.

54:50.867 --> 54:53.345
We're right above the
Hall of Five Hundred.

54:53.370 --> 54:56.574
There's a stairway leading down
to the street on the other side.

54:56.599 --> 54:57.793
So.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.734
One step at a time.

55:10.207 --> 55:11.592
Okay?

55:14.604 --> 55:16.586
Are you afraid of heights?

55:16.846 --> 55:18.103
A little.

55:18.128 --> 55:20.974
I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.

55:22.038 --> 55:23.872
So, don't look down.

55:23.897 --> 55:27.394
Or do.
I can never remember which.

56:04.046 --> 56:05.723
It's not that hard.

56:20.670 --> 56:22.245
Sienna!

56:32.183 --> 56:33.898
Are you alright?

56:33.923 --> 56:35.560
- You okay?
- Yeah.

56:35.585 --> 56:38.730
Alright, just...
crawl along that beam there.

56:38.755 --> 56:41.603
And I'll meet you on the
far side, by the ladder.

56:48.829 --> 56:50.145
Sir.

56:50.170 --> 56:53.857
Give me a six men stationed here.
Safeties off.

57:03.905 --> 57:07.052
You're being stupid now, Professor Langdon!

57:07.571 --> 57:09.916
Go. Go.
Get out of here, go!

57:12.912 --> 57:16.444
They needed you but now
they changed their minds.

57:49.114 --> 57:52.906
Get these people out.
Everyone out, clear the room.

58:06.489 --> 58:08.043
Give me that.

58:10.358 --> 58:12.550
These doors, here.

58:12.575 --> 58:15.166
- Eastern side. That's where they're headed.
- Okay.

58:15.191 --> 58:17.215
Go, move.
Quickly!

59:07.558 --> 59:10.750
Bouchard.
Agent Bouchard, come in.

59:12.201 --> 59:16.526
What is your location?
Agent Bouchard, come in.

59:16.815 --> 59:18.308
REBIRTH

59:18.333 --> 59:21.888
That same word is on the envelope
the video arrived in,

59:21.919 --> 59:24.979
along with the date.
The date is tomorrow.

59:25.004 --> 59:28.880
Well, thank you,
that was not lost on me.

59:29.952 --> 59:32.995
The darkest places in hell
are reserved for those

59:33.020 --> 59:36.500
who refuse to act in
time of moral crisis.

59:36.635 --> 59:41.186
Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore,
it's prophecy.

59:41.278 --> 59:44.587
We have created
our own hell on earth.

59:44.612 --> 59:46.376
Oh my.

59:46.401 --> 59:49.675
The warnings have been obvious,
the solutions ignored.

59:49.700 --> 59:52.198
So, I took action.

59:52.223 --> 59:56.403
If you are watching this,
it means the Inferno virus was released

59:56.428 --> 59:58.822
last night at midnight, and...

59:58.847 --> 1:00:01.732
it's now being carried to
every corner of the Earth.

1:00:01.757 --> 1:00:03.556
Oh my.

1:00:03.581 --> 1:00:07.980
Within 6 days of it's released,
the virus will replicate itself.

1:00:08.005 --> 1:00:12.104
And every man, woman and child
on Earth expect the current...

1:00:12.748 --> 1:00:16.980
the current population
to be culled by half.

1:00:17.013 --> 1:00:20.292
The survivors will witness

1:00:21.274 --> 1:00:26.478
horrors...
unknown to this planet.

1:00:27.016 --> 1:00:29.676
But I want them to know why.

1:00:29.701 --> 1:00:34.544
That this was our doing
and this is our salvation.

1:00:34.569 --> 1:00:36.378
Now is the time.

1:00:38.063 --> 1:00:39.546
Today is...

1:00:39.971 --> 1:00:40.998
There's more.

1:00:41.023 --> 1:00:43.205
I believe I've got the gist.

1:00:43.746 --> 1:00:45.488
It appears our organization has spent

1:00:45.513 --> 1:00:48.338
the last several years
in the employ of a madman

1:00:48.363 --> 1:00:51.998
who now intends to commit a mass murder
using a deadly plague of his own creation

1:00:52.030 --> 1:00:54.930
in some point in the next 24...
Sorry.

1:00:55.355 --> 1:00:57.474
Less than 12 hours.

1:00:57.817 --> 1:01:00.689
So, let's do our level best
not to fuck things up

1:01:00.714 --> 1:01:04.612
any worse than we already have,
shall we?

1:01:05.167 --> 1:01:08.815
Without the Faraday pointer,
no one can find the virus.

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.417
Where is Professor Langdon now?

1:01:10.442 --> 1:01:14.105
He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli
Gardens but we seemed to have lost visual.

1:01:14.130 --> 1:01:16.793
And I'm afraid we have
no contact from Vayentha.

1:01:16.818 --> 1:01:18.336
I see.

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:21.427
I'm going to Florence myself.

1:01:32.247 --> 1:01:36.097
Test her for signs of contagion
and quarantine this place.

1:01:37.548 --> 1:01:39.367
If we don't find Langdon very soon,

1:01:39.392 --> 1:01:42.578
we are going to be looking at
a great many more dead bodies.

1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:08.211
Are you alright?

1:02:09.389 --> 1:02:11.123
It's weakness.

1:02:11.430 --> 1:02:14.172
Just weakness, god damn it.

1:02:14.907 --> 1:02:16.755
We'll just take a moment.

1:02:16.780 --> 1:02:18.961
Did you see her down there?

1:02:19.709 --> 1:02:20.709
Yes.

1:02:20.734 --> 1:02:23.893
Everything I've done, every bit of
work and studies since I was eleven

1:02:23.918 --> 1:02:25.908
is to stop death, not cause it.

1:02:25.933 --> 1:02:28.830
It was self defense.
Someone was trying to kill us.

1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:31.503
I don't know if
I can finish this.

1:02:33.335 --> 1:02:36.681
I understand if you can't.

1:02:37.676 --> 1:02:41.089
Look, Zobrist is the murderer,
not you.

1:02:41.651 --> 1:02:43.594
You saved me.

1:02:44.137 --> 1:02:46.617
You don't have to
take another step.

1:02:48.899 --> 1:02:50.727
Yeah, you're right.

1:02:51.669 --> 1:02:55.432
I did what was necessary and
I'll do it again if I need to.

1:02:55.857 --> 1:02:58.016
I pray that you don't.

1:03:02.018 --> 1:03:04.621
Looks like it's close for repairs.

1:03:05.785 --> 1:03:07.547
Okay, this way.

1:03:23.425 --> 1:03:24.802
There.

1:03:24.827 --> 1:03:27.059
The baptismal font.

1:03:57.001 --> 1:03:59.050
Dante again.

1:03:59.075 --> 1:04:00.952
Always Dante, why Dante?

1:04:00.977 --> 1:04:03.796
- Acrylic gesso.
- You mean paint.

1:04:03.821 --> 1:04:06.056
Water soluble paint.

1:04:06.907 --> 1:04:09.123
Smells like a wet dog.

1:04:14.337 --> 1:04:17.070
Look at that.
There's a writing.

1:04:17.095 --> 1:04:23.393
"Seek the treacherous Doge of Venice,

1:04:23.793 --> 1:04:30.006
- "who severed the heads from horses."
- Venice.

1:04:30.403 --> 1:04:33.953
Where Dante was infected
with the disease that killed him.

1:04:34.606 --> 1:04:39.208
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom,

1:04:39.233 --> 1:04:48.074
and listen for the sounds
of trickling water."

1:04:48.099 --> 1:04:52.162
"Follow deep into the sunken palace,

1:04:52.187 --> 1:04:57.546
- "where the chthonic monster waits."
- The plague itself.

1:04:57.571 --> 1:04:59.396
Underwater.

1:05:00.484 --> 1:05:04.855
"Submerged in the
blood-red waters of..."

1:05:09.873 --> 1:05:14.698
of the lagoon that reflects no stars."
- Professor.

1:05:15.524 --> 1:05:18.271
Could you please tell me
what the hell you are doing?

1:05:19.917 --> 1:05:21.447
Why haven't you called in?

1:05:21.472 --> 1:05:22.704
Who are you?

1:05:22.729 --> 1:05:26.698
Christoph Bouchard,
from the World Health Organization.

1:05:26.970 --> 1:05:29.558
- We've met.
- We've met?

1:05:29.698 --> 1:05:32.991
You really don't remember?
It was just 2 days ago.

1:05:33.016 --> 1:05:35.210
He's suffering the effects
of a head wound.

1:05:35.247 --> 1:05:38.471
He can't remember the events
for the last 48 hours.

1:05:40.621 --> 1:05:44.035
I'm the one who flew to Cambridge
and asked for your help.

1:05:44.060 --> 1:05:46.702
I gave you the pointer
to decode.

1:05:46.727 --> 1:05:48.233
Mr. Langdon.

1:05:48.258 --> 1:05:49.840
Yes.

1:05:50.456 --> 1:05:54.171
Okay.
I remember.

1:05:55.836 --> 1:05:56.857
Who are you?

1:05:56.882 --> 1:06:00.258
I was the ER doctor at the hospital
when the Professor came in.

1:06:01.069 --> 1:06:03.851
What is the last thing you remember?

1:06:04.430 --> 1:06:07.676
I was on the street.
I think it was here.

1:06:09.586 --> 1:06:11.605
I was with a woman.

1:06:11.630 --> 1:06:14.990
- And I was given an injection.
- Elizabeth Sinskey.

1:06:15.015 --> 1:06:16.358
Elizabeth?

1:06:16.383 --> 1:06:18.276
From the World Health Organization.

1:06:18.301 --> 1:06:19.902
Do you know her?

1:06:20.987 --> 1:06:22.330
I do.

1:06:22.355 --> 1:06:24.970
But I haven't seen Elizabeth in years.

1:06:24.995 --> 1:06:26.740
She's the reason
I followed you alone.

1:06:26.765 --> 1:06:27.693
What do you mean?

1:06:27.718 --> 1:06:31.061
I believe Dr. Sinskey is working
with a foreign government

1:06:31.086 --> 1:06:32.941
to find and sell the virus.

1:06:32.966 --> 1:06:35.213
No. No. No.
That's not possible.

1:06:35.238 --> 1:06:37.093
People change, Professor.

1:06:37.118 --> 1:06:39.743
I've been chasing
Bertrand Zobrist for 2 years.

1:06:39.768 --> 1:06:43.434
And someone has been
working against me.

1:06:45.719 --> 1:06:48.781
Let's get to the point.
You know where the virus is?

1:06:48.806 --> 1:06:51.731
I assume you have
some sort of credentials.

1:06:52.096 --> 1:06:53.868
Call WHO if you like.

1:06:53.893 --> 1:06:56.854
Check me out, but do it quickly.

1:07:01.418 --> 1:07:03.734
Venice.
We think it's Venice.

1:07:03.759 --> 1:07:04.967
Good.

1:07:04.992 --> 1:07:07.219
It's 2 hours by train.
Come on.

1:07:07.244 --> 1:07:10.100
If I could find you,
so can the others.

1:07:10.992 --> 1:07:13.448
I'm buying you both
plane tickets to Geneva.

1:07:13.473 --> 1:07:16.029
No, not Geneva.
He said Venice.

1:07:16.054 --> 1:07:17.699
I heard that.

1:07:20.395 --> 1:07:22.427
Excuse us.
Please watch yourselves.

1:07:22.452 --> 1:07:25.308
Step back, please.
Excuse us.

1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:27.631
Excuse us.

1:07:28.487 --> 1:07:30.196
Watch yourself, please.

1:07:30.221 --> 1:07:33.875
- This is the plane to Geneva?
- Yes, but we just closed the door.

1:07:33.900 --> 1:07:36.898
Keep the plane at the gate.
We need to check every passenger.

1:07:36.923 --> 1:07:39.298
That would be a waste of time.

1:07:39.590 --> 1:07:42.294
And we have very little of that.

1:07:52.206 --> 1:07:56.765
3 days ago, after 2 years
of searching, I found Zobrist.

1:07:56.790 --> 1:08:00.591
He killed himself.
But we took a package from his pocket.

1:08:00.616 --> 1:08:01.796
And what was in it?

1:08:01.821 --> 1:08:04.798
The Faraday pointer
with the map of hell.

1:08:04.823 --> 1:08:09.413
A puzzle, specifically designed
for his followers to solve.

1:08:09.438 --> 1:08:11.054
We brought it to you.

1:08:11.079 --> 1:08:12.859
And you were in the
process of decoding it,

1:08:12.884 --> 1:08:14.803
when you were kidnapped.

1:08:16.875 --> 1:08:19.011
Professor Langdon.

1:08:25.344 --> 1:08:29.364
- You were with Dr. Sinskey at the time.
- Elizabeth, yes.

1:08:29.389 --> 1:08:33.587
Did she tell you about any
third party interest in the virus?

1:08:35.384 --> 1:08:38.278
- I don't remember.
- Did she have financial problems?

1:08:38.303 --> 1:08:39.446
Uh, I don't know.

1:08:39.471 --> 1:08:41.089
Did she carry more
than one cellphone?

1:08:41.114 --> 1:08:42.073
I don't know.

1:08:42.098 --> 1:08:43.203
- Think.
- He doesn't remember.

1:08:43.227 --> 1:08:48.688
Then tell me who can remember, Professor! Enough
with the "I don't know, I don't remember."!

1:08:48.713 --> 1:08:50.638
It's not good for him.

1:08:52.317 --> 1:08:54.979
The "gilded museum,"
is that Saint Mark's.

1:08:55.004 --> 1:08:56.802
All of Venice is a museum.

1:08:56.827 --> 1:09:01.301
St. Mark's has the Horses of
Constantinople, they're bronze statues.

1:09:01.326 --> 1:09:03.128
Can I see that?

1:09:06.992 --> 1:09:08.895
I wouldn't touch it.

1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:11.060
I wasn't planning on it.

1:09:19.207 --> 1:09:20.735
Professor.

1:09:22.926 --> 1:09:24.711
Professor Langdon.

1:09:24.736 --> 1:09:26.441
Professor Langdon.

1:09:26.523 --> 1:09:28.485
Professor Langdon.

1:09:29.450 --> 1:09:31.209
Yes.

1:09:32.443 --> 1:09:34.374
Hello, Robert.

1:09:36.471 --> 1:09:38.254
Elizabeth.

1:09:38.438 --> 1:09:40.746
It's been a long time.

1:09:44.824 --> 1:09:46.726
Too long.

1:09:48.647 --> 1:09:50.593
What brings you here?

1:09:52.364 --> 1:09:55.184
The WHO needs your help.

1:09:55.751 --> 1:09:56.854
My help?

1:09:56.879 --> 1:09:59.381
I hope you still
remember your Dante.

1:10:02.907 --> 1:10:04.732
What just happened?

1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:12.035
Are you alright?

1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:14.915
Could you get some water?
He could be dehydrated.

1:10:14.940 --> 1:10:18.945
Some food, maybe some fruit
or something from the machine.

1:10:18.970 --> 1:10:20.848
- Quickly.
- Sure.

1:10:20.873 --> 1:10:22.402
Thank you.

1:10:30.413 --> 1:10:33.029
- Is he lying?
- Through his teeth.

1:10:33.054 --> 1:10:36.061
He was not the one who came
to Cambridge to see me.

1:10:48.929 --> 1:10:53.394
Bouchard, I need help, quickly.
I think he's collapsed.

1:11:02.701 --> 1:11:04.791
I can't open the door.

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:07.810
Langdon?

1:11:08.572 --> 1:11:10.152
Are you okay?

1:11:12.023 --> 1:11:13.965
Langdon, are you okay?

1:11:25.860 --> 1:11:27.471
Come on, let's go!

1:11:32.845 --> 1:11:34.536
You're telling me that
for 2 years,

1:11:34.561 --> 1:11:37.790
you and your organization
have been working against me.

1:11:37.815 --> 1:11:38.949
That is correct.

1:11:38.974 --> 1:11:41.537
To shield Bertrand Zobrist
and his research.

1:11:41.562 --> 1:11:44.859
- To hide him, to protect him.
- Regrettably, yes.

1:11:44.884 --> 1:11:48.242
And that all of my attempts
to prevent him from initiating

1:11:48.267 --> 1:11:52.389
a worldwide pandemic
have failed because of you.

1:11:52.414 --> 1:11:54.809
An incisive sum-up, yes.

1:11:54.834 --> 1:12:01.069
Now you have the temerity to ask
that I simply decide to trust you?

1:12:01.094 --> 1:12:05.426
I'm terribly sorry,
I didn't see any other way.

1:12:08.915 --> 1:12:12.817
Who exactly does
your group work for?

1:12:15.816 --> 1:12:17.926
Our clients, of course.

1:12:17.951 --> 1:12:22.109
We are a private security firm.
A very successful one.

1:12:22.134 --> 1:12:24.001
May I ask,

1:12:24.624 --> 1:12:27.955
the gentleman who was with you,
agent Bouchard,

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:30.447
where is he now?

1:12:31.751 --> 1:12:34.248
We don't know.
We lost track of him.

1:12:34.797 --> 1:12:37.152
Then the situation is
worse than you think.

1:12:37.177 --> 1:12:39.991
There is only one reason
he would move out of contact,

1:12:40.016 --> 1:12:42.143
he wants Mr. Langdon to himself.

1:12:42.168 --> 1:12:43.088
Why?

1:12:43.113 --> 1:12:46.288
To find the virus and sell it
to the highest bidder I assume.

1:12:46.321 --> 1:12:49.395
Leverage, blackmail,
you know, the usual shit.

1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:52.554
I don't think we have anything
further to discuss, Mr. Sims.

1:12:52.579 --> 1:12:55.866
And I have less than 8 hours
to find this pathogen, excuse me.

1:12:55.891 --> 1:13:00.136
From what I understand,
you knew the Professor sometime ago.

1:13:02.032 --> 1:13:03.785
Personally.

1:13:05.370 --> 1:13:07.401
You care about him.

1:13:08.568 --> 1:13:14.888
You would even ally with an unscrupulous character
such as myself to protect him, wouldn't you?

1:13:18.634 --> 1:13:22.762
My organization has the resources
to find your Professor.

1:13:49.990 --> 1:13:53.132
If you wanted to start a plague,
this is where you do it.

1:13:53.157 --> 1:13:54.575
Yep.

1:13:54.990 --> 1:13:58.841
20 million people a year come here
from every corner of the globe.

1:13:58.866 --> 1:14:02.806
During the Black Death,
the Venetians made all the ships

1:14:02.831 --> 1:14:04.693
anchored in the harbor
for 40 days,

1:14:04.718 --> 1:14:06.790
before they would allow
the crews into the city.

1:14:06.815 --> 1:14:09.729
Making sure that they were not
carrying the Plague.

1:14:09.754 --> 1:14:11.919
The word "Quarantine"
comes from the Italian.

1:14:11.944 --> 1:14:14.862
"Quaranta", "forty".

1:14:15.081 --> 1:14:17.716
It's nice to have you back, Professor.

1:14:18.622 --> 1:14:22.372
There, the horses.

1:14:28.399 --> 1:14:32.367
These were recreations, the originals
are in a museum for preservation.

1:14:32.392 --> 1:14:35.507
We should be quick.
Bouchard knows we are coming here.

1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:37.939
Excuse me.

1:14:38.417 --> 1:14:42.188
Ask that guide, if the heads have
ever been severed from these horses?

1:14:42.213 --> 1:14:45.245
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1:14:45.270 --> 1:14:47.094
- Excuse me.
- Please excuse me.

1:14:47.119 --> 1:14:48.528
Please.

1:14:57.023 --> 1:14:58.704
According to the tale,
during the Crusades,

1:14:58.729 --> 1:15:01.754
the horses were looted
from Constantinople.

1:15:04.898 --> 1:15:06.623
Horses...

1:15:08.522 --> 1:15:11.571
But they were too large to be
loaded on board the ships,

1:15:13.651 --> 1:15:16.105
so their heads were removed
and reattached.

1:15:16.130 --> 1:15:17.616
By whom?

1:15:18.054 --> 1:15:20.613
The doge who lived forever,
Enrico Dandolo.

1:15:20.638 --> 1:15:23.497
- Enrico Dandolo.
- The doge who lived forever.

1:15:23.522 --> 1:15:25.109
Of course, Enrico Dandolo.

1:15:25.134 --> 1:15:27.389
Dandolo tricked the Venetians
into the Crusades.

1:15:27.414 --> 1:15:32.296
He was supposed to sail his ships to Egypt,
but he sacked Constantinople instead.

1:15:32.321 --> 1:15:34.457
I'm sorry.
Of course.

1:15:34.482 --> 1:15:37.080
"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."

1:15:38.110 --> 1:15:40.089
Are we in the wrong basilica?

1:15:40.114 --> 1:15:42.193
We're in the wrong country.

1:15:42.833 --> 1:15:45.118
Dandolo passed,
but he was not buried here.

1:15:45.143 --> 1:15:46.759
So where was he buried?

1:15:46.784 --> 1:15:48.750
Hagia Sophia.

1:15:49.053 --> 1:15:51.383
- Istanbul.
- Istanbul.

1:16:37.564 --> 1:16:39.363
There's always a way out.

1:16:40.582 --> 1:16:42.129
Here.
Here.

1:16:49.138 --> 1:16:51.206
See if you could get that open.

1:16:54.031 --> 1:16:55.779
I got your foot.

1:17:11.812 --> 1:17:13.585
Can you get it?

1:17:26.861 --> 1:17:28.098
Is there someone there?

1:17:28.123 --> 1:17:29.967
Please help.

1:17:35.370 --> 1:17:36.681
Yes.

1:17:36.899 --> 1:17:38.538
Give me a hand.

1:17:38.563 --> 1:17:40.858
- One hundred.
- Yes! Yes.

1:17:40.883 --> 1:17:43.417
- A hundred euro.
- Here. I got it. I got it.

1:17:51.864 --> 1:17:53.446
Quick. Quick. Quick.

1:18:15.372 --> 1:18:16.983
Thank you.

1:18:37.699 --> 1:18:39.234
What are you doing?

1:18:40.558 --> 1:18:44.809
You called him a murderer,
a psychopath.

1:18:46.037 --> 1:18:47.406
What?

1:18:47.431 --> 1:18:50.520
But history will call us saviors.

1:18:53.032 --> 1:18:56.871
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

1:18:58.370 --> 1:19:00.744
I'm not afraid to die, Robert.

1:19:03.865 --> 1:19:06.614
But doing nothing terrifies me.

1:19:06.639 --> 1:19:11.824
The path, and the pointer,
he left that all for you, Zobrist.

1:19:12.970 --> 1:19:16.119
- You knew him?
- Knew him?

1:19:16.508 --> 1:19:18.743
I loved him.

1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:21.660
You're wearing his suit.

1:19:22.523 --> 1:19:24.906
No.
Sienna, no.

1:19:24.938 --> 1:19:26.713
Thank you, Robert.

1:19:29.124 --> 1:19:31.357
Thank you for everything.

1:19:32.670 --> 1:19:36.461
No. No.
Sienna, no!

1:19:37.151 --> 1:19:38.668
Sienna!

1:19:39.208 --> 1:19:41.957
No, Sienna!
Sienna, no!

1:20:10.146 --> 1:20:13.587
Slow down, slow down.
You're too fast.

1:20:36.174 --> 1:20:38.228
Oh, come on.
Come on.

1:20:38.253 --> 1:20:40.495
This took me 3 days.

1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:42.273
Too easy.

1:20:42.298 --> 1:20:44.365
THE GOLDEN AGE

1:20:52.594 --> 1:20:54.246
I love it.

1:21:05.399 --> 1:21:08.393
Everything before you exist,

1:21:09.984 --> 1:21:11.875
an idea.

1:21:14.291 --> 1:21:16.266
And now it's real.

1:21:18.414 --> 1:21:23.466
Love awakens the soul to act.

1:21:28.199 --> 1:21:33.424
That's not fair.
Quoting Dante to me.

1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:40.385
But it's beauty, not love.

1:21:55.461 --> 1:21:56.997
What?

1:22:00.219 --> 1:22:02.465
It's a minute to midnight.

1:22:05.198 --> 1:22:07.863
Sooner than I expected.

1:22:11.466 --> 1:22:13.418
Where're we going?

1:22:19.881 --> 1:22:21.414
Oh.

1:22:22.953 --> 1:22:25.016
I see.

1:22:27.490 --> 1:22:33.326
We planned it together,
we designed it together,

1:22:35.179 --> 1:22:37.695
but this part
only belongs to you.

1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:42.225
It's just safer if
you don't know where.

1:22:44.824 --> 1:22:47.336
What if they find you first?

1:22:50.412 --> 1:22:52.236
What then?

1:22:56.508 --> 1:22:59.227
If you want to know,
you're not alone.

1:23:00.302 --> 1:23:02.468
You got to start by trusting me.

1:23:02.493 --> 1:23:05.621
Unless we take bold immediate action

1:23:05.646 --> 1:23:10.500
the sixth extinction
will be our own.

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:24.700
You were right.

1:23:27.648 --> 1:23:30.113
I'm going to make
you another path.

1:23:32.301 --> 1:23:34.542
Inferno will be at the end.

1:23:34.567 --> 1:23:39.850
If something should happen to me,
the first clue will be deliver to you.

1:23:39.875 --> 1:23:42.804
I know you'll do
what must to be done.

1:23:43.279 --> 1:23:45.404
Seek and find.

1:23:49.446 --> 1:23:51.402
You're not alone.

1:24:54.813 --> 1:24:56.483
So.

1:24:56.508 --> 1:25:00.087
The beautiful young woman
went for the bad guy.

1:25:00.969 --> 1:25:03.130
That happens.

1:25:04.344 --> 1:25:06.570
You look disappointed.

1:25:08.063 --> 1:25:09.650
I'll give you a minute.

1:25:09.675 --> 1:25:14.668
Elizabeth is not the one
who wants the virus to sell.

1:25:15.264 --> 1:25:16.984
You are.

1:25:17.884 --> 1:25:20.038
You've been used.

1:25:20.716 --> 1:25:25.538
Elaborate schemes created by people
to get you to do what they want.

1:25:27.027 --> 1:25:28.754
But me,

1:25:30.443 --> 1:25:32.220
I'm very direct.

1:25:32.245 --> 1:25:35.998
And this is a moment of
great opportunity for me.

1:25:36.023 --> 1:25:39.276
So, where is the virus?

1:25:44.278 --> 1:25:46.479
Come on, Professor.

1:25:46.825 --> 1:25:49.520
How much life is
there in the world?

1:25:50.309 --> 1:25:53.247
How much more is fighting
to be born?

1:25:55.773 --> 1:25:59.073
Nothing wrong with thinning
the herd once in a while.

1:26:04.710 --> 1:26:06.480
It's healthy.

1:26:08.523 --> 1:26:11.174
I've seen many acts of god.

1:26:11.274 --> 1:26:16.031
I mean, typhoons, cholera.
And you know what?

1:26:17.104 --> 1:26:20.180
Sometimes it hits the right people.

1:26:20.584 --> 1:26:24.287
- That's inhuman.
- Humanity is inhuman.

1:26:24.312 --> 1:26:27.782
Life maybe cheap,
but the means to end it on a mass scale,

1:26:27.807 --> 1:26:30.558
no one ever stops
paying for that.

1:26:38.196 --> 1:26:41.227
I'm going to ask you
for the last...

1:26:44.906 --> 1:26:47.001
Terribly sorry.

1:26:49.745 --> 1:26:51.743
Didn't see any other way.

1:26:52.947 --> 1:26:57.275
Must do this quickly.
The less blood the better.

1:26:57.954 --> 1:26:59.729
Who are you?

1:27:00.822 --> 1:27:03.422
Oh, a facilitator.

1:27:03.447 --> 1:27:06.662
Among other things
my company creates illusions.

1:27:06.687 --> 1:27:09.084
You never had a real head wound.

1:27:11.380 --> 1:27:16.358
- But I lost my memory.
- Chemically induced.

1:27:16.383 --> 1:27:20.014
We gave you an injection
of benzodiazapenes.

1:27:20.415 --> 1:27:25.440
Sorry, it can produce a skin rash.
It should fade in a day or so.

1:27:28.883 --> 1:27:31.054
All this was a...

1:27:31.079 --> 1:27:32.662
All this was a fake?

1:27:32.687 --> 1:27:35.754
I prefer created reality.

1:27:35.779 --> 1:27:40.015
My agents kidnapped you.

1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:43.755
They cleared your memories so
we could create a fresh scenario,

1:27:43.780 --> 1:27:47.600
whereby you would be
invested in the idea of helping us.

1:27:48.708 --> 1:27:54.386
A small incision was made in your scalp
to give the impression of a bullet graze.

1:27:55.982 --> 1:27:58.530
There are no locks on hospital doors.

1:27:58.555 --> 1:28:00.174
Exactly.

1:28:00.287 --> 1:28:01.594
Highest marks.

1:28:01.620 --> 1:28:05.082
What about the policewoman who shot
the Doctor in the hospital?

1:28:05.107 --> 1:28:06.344
Also it's me.

1:28:06.369 --> 1:28:08.113
Her gun fired blanks.

1:28:08.628 --> 1:28:10.859
And there were squibs in the door.

1:28:10.883 --> 1:28:12.955
The doctor was an agent
wearing a blood packet.

1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:16.935
The taxi driver, the hospital
was working for us as well.

1:28:17.307 --> 1:28:20.162
At the Palazzo Vecchio
she tried to kill me.

1:28:20.743 --> 1:28:22.641
It was real bullets.

1:28:23.229 --> 1:28:25.174
At my behest.

1:28:25.199 --> 1:28:27.627
When things that appeared
to go tits up

1:28:27.652 --> 1:28:29.782
I try to sweep it
all away quickly.

1:28:29.807 --> 1:28:31.083
By killing me?

1:28:31.108 --> 1:28:34.762
I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.

1:28:41.786 --> 1:28:44.325
I did lose an experienced agent.

1:28:45.634 --> 1:28:49.635
There's a great deal of situation
I've been informed in my line of work.

1:28:51.401 --> 1:28:54.190
Look, hear me what I know.

1:28:54.215 --> 1:28:56.737
I know I've behaved terribly.

1:28:59.732 --> 1:29:04.462
But a puzzle needed solving,
who better to solve it than you.

1:29:05.026 --> 1:29:06.898
Glance at it, will you?

1:29:20.330 --> 1:29:22.563
Not my best work.

1:29:23.149 --> 1:29:25.807
But it will do for the Italians.

1:29:26.695 --> 1:29:31.829
Zobrist had followers everywhere
when Sienna first came to me for help.

1:29:31.854 --> 1:29:33.818
Or so I thought.

1:29:33.843 --> 1:29:38.430
She came to us with serious concerns
shortly after Zobrist died.

1:29:39.510 --> 1:29:42.683
Somehow, she knew Zobrist had hired us.

1:29:42.708 --> 1:29:46.349
She said he was doing biological work
that could be fallen into the wrong hands.

1:29:46.374 --> 1:29:49.531
She didn't mention a plague.
But we heard enough to be alarmed.

1:29:49.556 --> 1:29:53.431
So we agreed to work with her
to find Zobrist's project.

1:29:53.456 --> 1:29:58.089
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in,
we saw an opportunity.

1:29:58.114 --> 1:30:00.363
It was Elizabeth
who came to see me.

1:30:00.388 --> 1:30:01.711
Yes.

1:30:01.736 --> 1:30:05.683
Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer
from agent Bouchard.

1:30:05.708 --> 1:30:07.925
She brought it to you to decode,

1:30:07.950 --> 1:30:10.782
and she even secured it
with your thumbprint.

1:30:10.807 --> 1:30:12.224
That left us with no choice,

1:30:12.249 --> 1:30:14.886
so we took you from her
on the street.

1:30:16.731 --> 1:30:20.979
The hospital scenario encouraged you
to trust Dr. Brooks.

1:30:21.004 --> 1:30:25.515
When you called to the Consulate
it was answered by our man.

1:30:25.540 --> 1:30:27.044
Professor Langdon?

1:30:27.069 --> 1:30:29.713
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.

1:30:29.738 --> 1:30:31.029
Are you still in possession?

1:30:31.054 --> 1:30:33.086
You had the pointer
and we had you.

1:30:33.111 --> 1:30:36.999
It was all working seamlessly
until Miss. Brooks stole you away.

1:30:37.024 --> 1:30:40.225
To make sure
the virus is released.

1:30:41.306 --> 1:30:43.258
It appears.

1:30:43.973 --> 1:30:46.642
Young people are disappointing.

1:30:48.052 --> 1:30:51.523
I find them become
tolerable around 35.

1:30:54.083 --> 1:30:56.470
You mentioed Dr. Sinskey.

1:31:04.028 --> 1:31:06.104
I've been so worried.

1:31:07.659 --> 1:31:09.409
Are you alright?

1:31:09.434 --> 1:31:11.735
- I'm fine.
- Are you?

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:13.561
I'm okay.

1:31:14.030 --> 1:31:15.833
I'm alright.

1:31:16.957 --> 1:31:18.639
Thank god.

1:31:21.108 --> 1:31:24.361
- Do you know where the virus is?
- Istanbul.

1:31:28.913 --> 1:31:30.907
Now's the time.

1:31:31.380 --> 1:31:33.644
Today is rebirth.

1:31:33.861 --> 1:31:36.232
Inferno is salvation.

1:31:41.799 --> 1:31:44.218
I am so sorry I brought
you into this, Robert,

1:31:44.243 --> 1:31:48.725
- after all these years.
- No. I'm glad you did.

1:31:49.232 --> 1:31:52.789
I met him, you know.
Zobrist, 2 years ago.

1:31:52.814 --> 1:31:54.545
He asked for my help.

1:31:54.570 --> 1:31:57.893
He wanted the WHO to
endorse mass sterilization

1:31:57.918 --> 1:32:00.524
in drinking waters and staple foods.

1:32:00.549 --> 1:32:04.695
So I threw him out of my office,
put him on the watch list.

1:32:05.544 --> 1:32:07.894
But he disappeared and...

1:32:09.563 --> 1:32:13.100
I suppose that's when
Zobrist hired Sims.

1:32:13.859 --> 1:32:18.138
I should probably have... have
I don't know.

1:32:18.163 --> 1:32:18.915
What?

1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:23.410
You always blame yourself for things
that weren't your fault.

1:32:25.311 --> 1:32:27.612
Still very sweet.

1:32:43.964 --> 1:32:46.294
Here, a doorway.

1:32:57.775 --> 1:33:01.815
I wish it would have happened differently,
back then.

1:33:03.742 --> 1:33:07.662
We didn't look after it.
It fell apart.

1:33:08.004 --> 1:33:09.941
Is that a regret?

1:33:12.188 --> 1:33:14.562
Only when I think about it.

1:33:20.538 --> 1:33:23.997
You know, the most interesting things
happened in doorways,

1:33:24.211 --> 1:33:28.253
at the borders,
right along the edges.

1:33:30.350 --> 1:33:35.110
Ancient fishermen learned to sail
where the warm water met the cold.

1:33:35.135 --> 1:33:39.522
The little fish would reach the edge
of the warm water and they stopped.

1:33:39.547 --> 1:33:42.459
And the big fish would come out
of the cold water and they eat them.

1:33:42.484 --> 1:33:44.923
And the fishermen.

1:33:45.316 --> 1:33:47.588
Well, they caught everybody.

1:33:52.393 --> 1:33:54.102
Doorways.

1:33:56.582 --> 1:34:00.723
Not one part of you
has changed, Robert.

1:34:03.990 --> 1:34:06.362
You talk too much.

1:34:08.072 --> 1:34:12.674
And then, not at all

1:34:13.503 --> 1:34:15.175
Elizabeth.

1:34:16.813 --> 1:34:22.491
I couldn't ask you
not to go to Geneva.

1:34:24.605 --> 1:34:26.012
I couldn't.

1:34:26.037 --> 1:34:29.786
I didn't want to ask you
to leave Cambridge.

1:34:35.261 --> 1:34:37.741
Was that how it happened?

1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:41.982
I don't trust my memory anymore.

1:34:42.922 --> 1:34:45.259
I never forget anything.

1:34:45.284 --> 1:34:47.388
Well, that's a gift.

1:34:47.413 --> 1:34:50.834
No, it isn't.

1:35:05.154 --> 1:35:08.135
Leave him alone! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:09.148
Leave him alone!

1:35:09.173 --> 1:35:10.914
Turn around!

1:35:11.064 --> 1:35:13.554
Don't look at me, bitch,
look away!

1:35:14.376 --> 1:35:15.909
Stop it!

1:35:20.510 --> 1:35:22.654
Don't look!

1:35:29.059 --> 1:35:30.919
Robert!

1:35:47.815 --> 1:35:49.509
Thank you.

1:36:25.945 --> 1:36:28.365
I'm a friend of the poet.

1:36:47.094 --> 1:36:49.289
For what did Zobrist die?

1:36:49.314 --> 1:36:51.709
That others may live.

1:36:54.082 --> 1:36:57.486
I've come very far to
make sure nothing interferes.

1:36:57.511 --> 1:37:01.596
The delivery system we designed will discharge
the viral agent by midnight tonight.

1:37:01.621 --> 1:37:04.207
But there are others who
are on their way to stop it.

1:37:04.232 --> 1:37:05.738
I need to find it before they do

1:37:05.763 --> 1:37:09.317
and trigger an explosion
to ensure it's released.

1:37:09.342 --> 1:37:11.226
How do we help?

1:37:13.826 --> 1:37:15.277
During the Plague of Justinian,

1:37:15.302 --> 1:37:19.309
5000 people died everyday
in the streets in Istanbul.

1:37:19.334 --> 1:37:22.747
A border between East and West,
another doorway.

1:37:22.772 --> 1:37:25.211
Which is why he chose it.

1:37:26.381 --> 1:37:28.548
If the bag is intact,
we can contain it.

1:37:28.573 --> 1:37:31.403
But if someone ruptures it
before we get there

1:37:32.072 --> 1:37:37.600
95% of the earth's population
will be infected in 47 days.

1:38:09.873 --> 1:38:11.862
Professor.
Doctor.

1:38:11.887 --> 1:38:15.024
My name is Mirsat,
I'm the curator here.

1:38:24.239 --> 1:38:26.452
Have you completely
evacuated the building?

1:38:26.477 --> 1:38:29.949
Well, to the extent that we can
but the place is massive.

1:38:29.974 --> 1:38:32.707
Could you tell me specifically
what it is you're looking for?

1:38:32.732 --> 1:38:34.901
The tomb of Enrico Dandolo.

1:38:34.926 --> 1:38:36.930
Of course, this way.

1:38:46.537 --> 1:38:50.584
"Kneel within the
gilded museum of holy wisdom,

1:38:50.933 --> 1:38:55.191
and listen for the sounds
of trickling water."

1:38:58.342 --> 1:39:02.972
"Follow deep into the sunken palace."

1:39:06.328 --> 1:39:08.322
I hear water flowing
under these stones.

1:39:08.347 --> 1:39:10.244
Where does it go?

1:39:10.269 --> 1:39:12.479
It's just drainage.
It goes to the city cistern.

1:39:12.504 --> 1:39:14.757
We're looking for a large,
underground space,

1:39:14.782 --> 1:39:17.676
perhaps with columns,
artificially lit from within.

1:39:17.725 --> 1:39:20.140
That's simple.
The ancient system,

1:39:20.165 --> 1:39:23.018
sixth century, Yerebatan Sarayi.

1:39:23.043 --> 1:39:25.112
Also called, "The sunken palace."

1:39:25.137 --> 1:39:26.657
Take us there.

1:39:26.682 --> 1:39:28.655
His words can only
mean one thing.

1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:31.711
Yerebatan Sarayi.
The Sunken Palace.

1:39:31.736 --> 1:39:36.057
Once we descend, you'll see
exactly what he described.

1:39:40.632 --> 1:39:42.729
How do I use it?

1:39:43.304 --> 1:39:46.693
There's a cap
in the padial integrate.

1:39:46.718 --> 1:39:50.154
The device also has a
detonation button.

1:39:50.179 --> 1:39:53.634
A call from this cellphone
will trigger the explosion.

1:39:53.658 --> 1:39:55.521
And that's enough
to break the bag?

1:39:55.547 --> 1:39:58.005
The walls are cement all around.

1:39:58.030 --> 1:40:02.483
You need both bombs, different angles,
as far apart as you can.

1:40:02.508 --> 1:40:04.609
That's what break the bag.

1:40:09.964 --> 1:40:14.596
History says that the Black Plague
caused misery and death.

1:40:14.621 --> 1:40:16.892
But, what they don't tell us,

1:40:16.917 --> 1:40:21.766
is that it also produced a leaner population,
and gave birth to the Renaissance.

1:40:21.791 --> 1:40:25.557
We are rushing as fast as we can
into the seventh circle of hell.

1:40:25.581 --> 1:40:27.205
Suicidal but profitable.

1:40:27.230 --> 1:40:29.925
Why is suffering later
preferable to suffering now?

1:40:29.951 --> 1:40:34.952
What if we embrace it.
And then maybe pain can save us.

1:40:36.185 --> 1:40:40.615
You're getting this, aren't you?
I can see that you are.

1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:43.839
Now I need to know
that I'm not alone.

1:40:57.844 --> 1:41:00.049
Too many damn people.

1:41:00.074 --> 1:41:01.368
He has chosen well.

1:41:01.393 --> 1:41:05.595
I need schematics of all
conduits in and out of the cistern.

1:41:05.861 --> 1:41:08.917
Full isolation and containment protocols.

1:41:08.942 --> 1:41:13.023
Physical and chemical
barriers along with... Wait.

1:41:15.346 --> 1:41:17.170
This is the city's water supply?

1:41:17.195 --> 1:41:19.258
Oh, not anymore.
We've modernized.

1:41:19.283 --> 1:41:20.432
But there is water in there.

1:41:20.457 --> 1:41:22.674
Yes.
It eventually filters down into the earth.

1:41:22.699 --> 1:41:24.040
But why are all these people here?

1:41:24.064 --> 1:41:27.512
It is a tourist attraction.
The acoustics are excellent.

1:41:27.537 --> 1:41:30.738
Tonight is the summer solstice concert,
very popular.

1:41:30.763 --> 1:41:33.623
People come from all over
the world to hear it.

1:41:33.892 --> 1:41:36.720
He created a bioaerosol.

1:41:37.073 --> 1:41:39.215
So it will spread in the air.

1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:41.548
- Empty the place.
- No.

1:41:41.784 --> 1:41:43.397
Contain it.

1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:47.615
Jam all communications down there.
No messages get in or out.

1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:48.979
Got it.

1:41:50.730 --> 1:41:52.390
Shall we go in?

1:41:56.337 --> 1:41:59.059
Robert, you don't have to
go in there with us.

1:41:59.430 --> 1:42:01.201
Yes, I do.

1:42:16.484 --> 1:42:21.340
"Blood-red waters
of the lagoon that reflects no stars."

1:42:21.365 --> 1:42:23.493
My god, this is a labyrinth.

1:42:23.603 --> 1:42:25.269
How many sections?

1:42:25.294 --> 1:42:28.494
There are dozens, Professor,
dozens.

1:42:29.998 --> 1:42:31.512
Let's find it.

1:42:31.537 --> 1:42:34.408
Check every section,
every column.

1:42:34.433 --> 1:42:36.108
Check them all.

1:42:36.209 --> 1:42:37.792
Spread out.

1:42:48.109 --> 1:42:50.233
Cut off cellphone service now.

1:42:50.258 --> 1:42:52.898
- No communications.
- Yes, sir.

1:42:59.420 --> 1:43:02.633
Those are US contacts over here,
I need some help.

1:43:05.186 --> 1:43:07.017
Here. This way.
Medusa.

1:43:07.042 --> 1:43:08.268
The Greek spirits, why?

1:43:08.293 --> 1:43:12.970
It belongs to a specific category of
Greek spirits. Chthonic monsters.

1:43:12.995 --> 1:43:15.190
- This is it?
- Yes.

1:43:15.215 --> 1:43:18.721
The color, the columns, it's exactly
what we saw in the video

1:43:18.746 --> 1:43:21.717
This is the area,
so spread out, check the pillars.

1:43:21.742 --> 1:43:23.926
- I'll take the wall line.
- The corners.

1:43:23.951 --> 1:43:25.398
Under the walkway.

1:43:25.423 --> 1:43:29.490
If you find anything,
report to me immediately.

1:43:29.772 --> 1:43:34.102
Light it here, someone
seconds matter.

1:43:47.630 --> 1:43:48.969
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1:43:48.994 --> 1:43:51.898
- What's going on?
- Sir, I need you to step aside.

1:43:52.340 --> 1:43:55.108
Step aside, everyone.

1:44:44.696 --> 1:44:48.724
I got it. It's here.
In this far corner.

1:45:29.597 --> 1:45:31.011
Don't.

1:45:51.955 --> 1:45:53.853
Hazmat guys aren't set yet.

1:45:53.878 --> 1:45:55.385
I can't wait.

1:45:58.734 --> 1:46:01.734
Quickly!
This could break any moment.

1:46:25.190 --> 1:46:27.002
Sienna!

1:46:29.199 --> 1:46:30.744
Sienna!

1:46:37.501 --> 1:46:40.091
This is cube nitrogen purge.
Could my hands have excess.

1:46:40.116 --> 1:46:42.580
- It should.
- It better.

1:46:51.585 --> 1:46:53.545
Sienna.
Sienna.

1:46:53.570 --> 1:46:55.144
There are too many
of us down here!

1:46:55.169 --> 1:46:57.480
You won't get to that
bag before we do!

1:46:57.505 --> 1:47:00.577
No.
But I can make sure it breaks.

1:47:00.602 --> 1:47:03.575
No. Don't do this, Sienna, don't.
You'll be murdering innocents.

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:05.482
Yes.
People will die

1:47:05.507 --> 1:47:08.378
a lot of them
but the crisis will be averted.

1:47:10.358 --> 1:47:11.850
It's what nature demands.

1:47:11.875 --> 1:47:14.693
The problem won't just be slowed down,
it would be solved permanently.

1:47:14.718 --> 1:47:18.859
Killing billions to save lives.
That's the logic of tyrants.

1:47:18.884 --> 1:47:22.229
- For a greater good, humanity...
- Geniuses don't come with extra rights.

1:47:22.254 --> 1:47:26.013
No, it comes with the responsibility
to take action when others won't!

1:47:26.038 --> 1:47:27.811
You want to do something, fine.

1:47:27.836 --> 1:47:31.379
Then scream at the top of your lungs.
An event and leave.

1:47:31.404 --> 1:47:34.833
If you loved humanity,
if you love this planet,

1:47:34.858 --> 1:47:36.882
you would do anything
to save it.

1:47:36.907 --> 1:47:41.359
The greatest sins in human history
had been committed in the name of love.

1:47:41.384 --> 1:47:43.904
No one will look on this act
and call it love.

1:47:43.929 --> 1:47:45.628
They'll be alive.

1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:49.111
What does it matter
what they say about us.

1:47:52.287 --> 1:47:54.047
No Signal

1:49:32.002 --> 1:49:34.230
Hey, what are you doing?

1:49:34.255 --> 1:49:35.659
Don't!

1:50:25.085 --> 1:50:27.154
Don't shoot the box!

1:50:42.579 --> 1:50:44.461
Robert, get clear!

1:51:01.086 --> 1:51:03.291
Are you alright?
Are you alright?

1:51:03.316 --> 1:51:04.415
Fine.

1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:07.520
Where's the box.
Where's the box.

1:51:52.333 --> 1:51:55.521
It's contained, no breach.

1:51:57.160 --> 1:51:59.621
The virus has been completely contained.

1:52:05.914 --> 1:52:09.494
The target is contained,
be prepared for transport.

1:53:05.236 --> 1:53:07.992
She thought she was
saving the world.

1:53:09.698 --> 1:53:11.791
So did they all.

1:53:22.181 --> 1:53:24.692
So, what would happen now?

1:53:24.717 --> 1:53:28.455
We'll take it back to Geneva for test,
put it in isolation.

1:53:28.885 --> 1:53:31.301
We'll have to generate
another geno sequences first

1:53:31.342 --> 1:53:33.936
to get an idea
what we are dealing with.

1:53:35.827 --> 1:53:38.119
There' a lot of work to be done.

1:53:42.566 --> 1:53:45.952
And you, Cambridge?

1:53:49.189 --> 1:53:50.688
Yeah.

1:53:53.789 --> 1:53:55.690
Dr. Sinskey?

1:53:59.530 --> 1:54:02.195
Life tore us apart again.

1:54:04.014 --> 1:54:06.922
Like Dante and Beatrice.

1:54:10.651 --> 1:54:12.916
I have something for you.

1:54:26.410 --> 1:54:29.189
I picked this up
the night you were taken.

1:54:29.214 --> 1:54:32.151
I seem to remember
it was important to you.

1:54:36.514 --> 1:54:38.731
Yes.
Yes, it is.

1:54:42.736 --> 1:54:46.932
Do you ever think
about what could happen

1:54:46.957 --> 1:54:48.874
with you and me?

1:54:50.330 --> 1:54:51.988
I do.

1:54:55.769 --> 1:54:59.242
I guess life must have
it's mysteries, Professor,

1:54:59.267 --> 1:55:01.533
even for us.

1:55:35.530 --> 1:55:39.425
- ' Scusati, do you speak English?
- Yes.

1:55:39.450 --> 1:55:42.395
Have you seen Marta Alvarez,
the museum staff?

1:55:42.420 --> 1:55:45.877
Marta isn't here just now.
She's had her baby.

1:55:45.902 --> 1:55:48.865
She had her baby?
Aw, that is great.

1:55:48.890 --> 1:55:50.165
Great news.

1:55:50.190 --> 1:55:52.906
Well, you might tell someone that
the lights on the Dante mask

1:55:52.931 --> 1:55:54.879
should be turned on
because I can barely see it.

1:55:54.904 --> 1:55:58.143
I'm sorry, sir,
the Dante mask is no longer here.

1:55:58.168 --> 1:55:59.569
It was stolen.

1:55:59.594 --> 1:56:02.294
Really?
I was just looking at it.

1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:04.812
Excuse me.
