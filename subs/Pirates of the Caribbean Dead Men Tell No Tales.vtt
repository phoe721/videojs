<i>Father's Curse.</i>

01:08.110 --> 01:10.028
<i>DEAD or ALIVE.</i>

02:59.638 --> 03:02.975
<i>THE FLYING DUTCHMAN</i>

03:33.922 --> 03:37.759
- Father.
- Henry. What have you done?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.763
- I said I'd find you.
- Look at me, son.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.395
- I don't care!
- There is no place for you on the Dutchman.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.485
They know you're here...
Get home to your mother.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.528
No!

03:57.070 --> 04:00.324
- Leave now, before it's too late.
- I won't!

04:00.657 --> 04:03.535
I'll never stop...
And if you throw me over,

04:03.869 --> 04:05.662
I'll come straight back..

04:06.914 --> 04:08.957
Don't you see,
I'm cursed to this ship?

04:08.999 --> 04:10.125
That's why I'm here.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.211
I think I know a way
to break your curse.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.629
To free you from the Dutchman.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.256
- Henry, no.
- I've read about a treasure.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.717
A treasure that holds
all the power of the sea,

04:18.759 --> 04:19.843
The Trident of Poseidon,

04:19.927 --> 04:21.553
can break your curse.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.891
Henry.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.019
The Trident can never be found.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.104
I found you.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.816
- It's just a tale.
- Like the tales of you.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.360
And Captain Jack Sparrow?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.070
He will help me find the trident.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.655
You stay away from Jack.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.283
Leave the sea forever.
You've to stop acting like a.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.827
A pirate. I won't stop.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.288
I want you to come home.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.713
Henry.

04:57.673 --> 04:58.924
I'm sorry.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.636
My curse will never be broken.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.723
This is my fate.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.393
You must let me go.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.609
I love you son.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.598
Captain Jack Sparrow.

05:51.393 --> 05:55.898
<i>Nine years later..</i>

06:12.331 --> 06:16.502
Faster you pathetic built rats,
you pump the builds..

06:16.585 --> 06:18.128
And fill the scuppers.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.464
We are chasing down pirates.

06:20.506 --> 06:24.092
Henry get back here. You don't wanna
get kicked off an another ship.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.596
It's a Dutch boat.
Probably stolen by the Pirate Bonet.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.148
My God.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.526
I warned you of leaving your post, boy.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.735
I need to speak with the captain.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.153
- What did you say?
- Move.

06:51.537 --> 06:52.996
It is going in, sir.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.874
Chase her down.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.338
No, don't do it!

07:02.673 --> 07:03.549
Don't do it..

07:03.590 --> 07:06.093
You will not address a Captain, boy.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.220
Sir, look at your charts.
I believe you're sailing us,

07:08.220 --> 07:09.596
in to the Devil's Triangle.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.722
Do you hear this man?

07:10.764 --> 07:13.767
This landsman,
believes an old sailor's myth.

07:13.809 --> 07:14.810
Sir.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.104
With all due respect
I have spent my life studying,

07:17.104 --> 07:19.606
the myths of the sea.
I know every legend and every curse.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.775
Do I know, ships that
sail into the triangle

07:21.775 --> 07:22.818
do not necessarily sail out.

07:22.818 --> 07:23.819
Don't worry sir.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.823
- This one is clearly disturbed.
- Sir, trust in what I say.

07:27.865 --> 07:28.782
Change your course.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.326
You dare to give me orders, boy?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.369
Arrest him!

07:33.245 --> 07:34.246
Turner!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.123
I'll not let you kill us all.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.042
Come on.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.601
This is treason!

07:58.770 --> 07:59.563
Lock him up.

07:59.688 --> 08:00.939
- No.
- I'm going in.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.615
This was your last chance, Turner.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.995
If it were up to me,
I would string you from the yard.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.830
On deck!

08:25.672 --> 08:27.257
Jack Sparrow.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.301
He's dead.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.679
Buried in an unmarked graveyard
of St. Martin.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.797
Sir, there's something in the water.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.758
Ship to starboard!

09:12.261 --> 09:15.055
That's no ship, sir.
It's a shipwreck.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.775
No.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.278
She's sailing straight towards us.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.822
Open fire!

10:51.068 --> 10:52.861
What are you?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.952
Death.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.962
<i>WANTED!
JACK SPARROW.</i>

11:54.256 --> 11:55.966
Jack Sparrow.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.390
Do you know this pirate?

12:04.975 --> 12:08.020
- Only by name.
- You could look me for him?

12:15.569 --> 12:18.363
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.576
For too many years
the Triangle has cursed us.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.579
Condemned us
to this Hell on Earth.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.915
The key to our escape..

12:27.998 --> 12:32.127
Is Jack Sparrow and the compass,
which he holds.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.796
No, no. No need to fear me boy.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.965
I always leave one man alive.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.133
To tell the tale.

12:38.967 --> 12:43.305
Find Sparrow for me
and relay a message.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.182
From Capitan Salazar.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.975
Salazar.

12:48.310 --> 12:52.272
Tell him I'll behold
the daylight again.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.358
And on that day.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.031
Death.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.244
Death.. comes straight for him.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.081
Would you say that to him? Please?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.959
- Yes.
- I wish I could tell him myself, but.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.546
Dead men tell no tales.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.911
You're an orphan,
born of the devil.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.247
Accused of practicing witchcraft.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.416
Before you die.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.252
Do you have anything to confess?

13:57.421 --> 14:02.259
I confess that I am not a witch.
That I'm a woman of science.

14:02.593 --> 14:06.680
I confess that I have survived on my own,
with nothing but a dairy.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.098
From a father I never knew.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.518
On a quest
for the truth of who I am.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.439
I confess that I will die
before I give up this search.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.065
And I confess.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.069
That while we've been talking.
I pitched this lock.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.457
Today we dedicate
The Royal Bank of St. Martin.

14:38.337 --> 14:43.050
The most secure banking institution
in the Caribbean.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.559
Our new vault..

14:52.601 --> 14:54.811
Is 5 inches thick.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.397
And weighs an imperial ton.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.650
I've got her!

14:59.942 --> 15:00.859
Get her!

15:00.901 --> 15:02.194
Don't let her get away.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.445
Stop that witch!

15:12.454 --> 15:16.166
With this bank,
the town of St. Martin,

15:16.291 --> 15:18.752
enters the modern world.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.969
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- The witch's get to the chains.

15:28.387 --> 15:30.097
Find that wicked lass.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.932
Or you swing in her place.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.934
- Sir.
- Sir.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.981
No man..
Nor army.

15:39.022 --> 15:42.860
Can ever rob the gold from St. Martin.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.362
Open the vault!

16:00.335 --> 16:01.545
Pirate!

16:02.838 --> 16:03.964
Pirate.?

16:04.923 --> 16:05.924
Pirates!

16:21.481 --> 16:25.819
This may seem a peculiar question.
Could someone explain to me..

16:26.528 --> 16:28.405
To why I'm here?

16:37.414 --> 16:38.415
How long?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.001
No, no no, wait,
it's coming to me.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.545
Need just a moment
to clear mi head.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.507
Make ready!

16:51.178 --> 16:54.932
Hold your fire.
There's a woman with him in the vault.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.983
Sir, I believe...
hat's your wife.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.740
Francis?

17:13.784 --> 17:15.202
Oh, I've got it!

17:16.912 --> 17:19.289
I've got it.
I'm robbing the bank!

17:19.331 --> 17:20.958
Shoot him!

18:07.045 --> 18:08.797
That was not part of the plan.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.260
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

18:53.383 --> 18:57.262
<i>NO DOGS,
NO WOMEN.</i>

19:12.152 --> 19:14.988
No woman has ever handled my...

19:23.247 --> 19:24.790
Clear the path.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.584
No, no, no, no!

19:30.337 --> 19:31.755
Stop, stop.. stop!

19:44.726 --> 19:46.353
Hard to starboard!

20:04.037 --> 20:06.331
Sir, your celestial fix was off.

20:06.415 --> 20:09.877
I have adjusted two degrees north.
Your map will no longer be imprecise.

20:10.127 --> 20:12.212
Although you will have to
start again with it.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.213
You're a witch.

20:13.297 --> 20:16.175
No, I'm not. Am I a witch
for having cataloged.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.677
- Over 200 stars?
- Witch!

20:20.721 --> 20:22.389
There is a blood moon coming.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.391
I simply need to purchase.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.393
A chronometer.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.271
I pay you double for
selling to a woman.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.439
Help me!

20:33.192 --> 20:36.612
Help! Help! There is
a witch in my shop.

20:38.780 --> 20:39.948
And a pirate!

20:40.115 --> 20:42.242
There is a witch and
a pirate in my shop.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.744
Well this is your lucky day!

20:44.578 --> 20:46.997
Have either of the four
of you seen my bank?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.543
Found it.

20:55.255 --> 20:58.133
- Were you part of the plan?
- I am not looking for trouble.

20:58.342 --> 20:59.968
What a horrible way to live.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.938
- Stop that Witch! Get her!
- We're trapped.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.272
What do we do?

21:15.359 --> 21:17.110
You need to scream.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.782
Over there! Secure that woman!

21:23.784 --> 21:27.246
- You filthy pirate!
- No need for lame calling!

22:04.032 --> 22:06.160
Jack!

22:10.664 --> 22:11.874
Bridge?

22:46.575 --> 22:47.576
It's empty!

22:48.911 --> 22:49.953
Where is the dash?

22:49.995 --> 22:52.039
Do you think that
robbing a bank is easy?

22:52.498 --> 22:54.875
You gaggle of gutless
use of the wound..

22:54.875 --> 22:57.628
Guilty of putting me on this
dreadful pickle in the first place.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.714
Now line up..
And offer me a tribute.

23:01.715 --> 23:03.342
Do you want us to pay you?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.427
Am I not the captain of this ship?

23:06.470 --> 23:08.639
You call this a ship?

23:08.931 --> 23:12.392
- Where is the treasure?
- All of us are starving.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.728
We'll no longer follow a captain
without a ship.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.021
I have a ship.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.567
Black Pearl has never left mi side.

23:20.943 --> 23:23.654
The pirate Barbarossa
rules these seas now.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.657
Has 10 ships.
Guns full.

23:27.199 --> 23:30.536
Not to mention his canon balls.
18 pounds each they say.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.663
One legged man with 18 pound balls?

23:33.288 --> 23:34.790
That's why he walks funny.

23:35.249 --> 23:36.834
Oh come, come mates?

23:36.875 --> 23:39.086
Did we not find the
treasure of Macedonia together?

23:39.169 --> 23:40.879
It was a troll of rotten wood.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.423
- Gold of King Midas.
- A pile of donkey dung.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.343
Face it Jack.
Bad luck dogs you,

23:46.343 --> 23:47.261
day & night.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.930
Now that is a bliss of fabrication.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.688
- You've lost your luck.
- You've lost your ship.

23:57.938 --> 24:00.482
Now.. you've lost your crew.

24:00.983 --> 24:03.819
Jack Sparrow is no longer our captain.

24:08.031 --> 24:12.369
I'm sorry Jack. But we've
reached the end of the horizon.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.301
You're all dismissed.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.302
Eh?

24:28.468 --> 24:30.512
All of ya! Dismissed!

24:31.471 --> 24:33.724
Never sail with Captain
Jack Sparrow again.

24:33.807 --> 24:34.975
Tell you that.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.274
The whole town speaks of you.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.694
The only survivor of the Monarch.
A boy who pelled..

25:27.778 --> 25:29.696
All the way to St Martin,
against the tide.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.281
On a piece of wood.

25:31.532 --> 25:34.451
Now gibbering about pirates.

25:34.827 --> 25:36.537
And tridents.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.664
Please sir, let me go off these chains.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.917
My job is to protect this island
and these waters.

25:42.751 --> 25:47.840
And your sleeves have been ripped,
The mark of treason.

25:47.965 --> 25:48.799
We were attacked by the dead.

25:48.841 --> 25:50.884
You're a coward who ran from battle.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.554
That is how you die.

26:05.482 --> 26:09.236
- I don't believe you're a coward.
- Please leave me sister.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.863
I've risked my life to come here.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.990
To see if the rumors are true.

26:13.323 --> 26:16.785
- Are you speak of the Trident?
- Who are you?

26:16.827 --> 26:21.915
- Tell me why you seek the trident?
- The Trident can break,

26:21.957 --> 26:23.417
any curse at sea.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.837
My father is trapped by such a curse.

26:26.879 --> 26:29.006
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.

26:29.256 --> 26:32.259
- Neither the ghosts.
- So you have gone mad?

26:32.426 --> 26:34.887
- I should never have come here.
- Then why did you come here?

26:35.345 --> 26:37.139
Because I need to get off this island.

26:37.264 --> 26:38.348
To solve the map.

26:38.432 --> 26:39.600
"No man can read".

26:40.100 --> 26:41.768
Left by Poseidon himself.

26:44.021 --> 26:47.566
- You've read the ancient text?
- In each language they were written.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.862
But this map has never
been seen or read,

26:51.904 --> 26:53.071
by any man.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.407
Luckily I am a woman.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.872
This is the diary of Galileo Galilei.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.541
He's spent his life
searching for the Trident,

27:04.583 --> 27:06.919
It's why he invented the spyglass.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.963
Why astronomers' spend their lives
staring in to the sky.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.175
So you're saying the
map no man can read,

27:13.592 --> 27:14.927
Is hidden in the stars?

27:14.968 --> 27:18.263
It was left to me by my father.
He believe I could find..

27:18.347 --> 27:20.516
What no man has ever found.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.017
I will not let him down.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.270
Soon, there will be blood moon.

27:25.312 --> 27:27.314
Only then can the map be read.

27:28.148 --> 27:31.235
- And the Trident found.
- Who are you?

27:31.401 --> 27:34.571
- Carina Smyth!
- If you have to save your father,

27:34.613 --> 27:37.366
you'll have to save me.
Find us a ship.

27:37.407 --> 27:38.784
And the Trident will be ours.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.870
Come to me Witch!

27:46.124 --> 27:47.459
Oh!

27:54.341 --> 27:55.509
He's gone.!

27:56.552 --> 27:57.803
He's gone sir.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.140
Find that coward!

28:02.641 --> 28:04.601
He will hang with the witch.

28:06.770 --> 28:09.189
Think Capt. Jack washed up right?

28:10.107 --> 28:12.693
I have not had a wash in years.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.323
Check the alley down there.

28:18.657 --> 28:21.451
You two, check the church.
Rest of you, with me.

28:28.542 --> 28:29.710
Bugger!

28:49.104 --> 28:53.567
- May I please have a drink, please?
- Show me your silver.

28:53.650 --> 28:54.651
Silver?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.285
How about a trade?

29:06.163 --> 29:07.456
Give me the bottle.

30:02.803 --> 30:03.929
Capitan.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.265
What's happening?

30:10.561 --> 30:14.565
Jack Sparrow, Jack Sparrow
has given away the compass.

30:26.952 --> 30:29.246
Daylight!

30:45.929 --> 30:47.598
We're free!

30:55.314 --> 30:59.276
Now, now, it's time,
to hunt a pirate.

31:06.909 --> 31:08.494
Pirate's life.

31:18.128 --> 31:19.505
Come to Daddy.

31:20.631 --> 31:22.633
Just the man we've been looking for.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.676
Why? Why am I looked for?

31:24.843 --> 31:27.262
Let it be known
that the pirate Jack Sparrow..

31:27.304 --> 31:29.473
Will be executed at dawn.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.724
Executed?

31:31.016 --> 31:35.646
I will never set foot in this town
again, sir. Be mark of words.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.463
To release the power of the sea.

33:24.963 --> 33:26.632
One must divide.

33:30.761 --> 33:34.139
It's an island.
The stars lead to an island.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.660
- I'm looking for a pirate, Jack Sparrow.
- Bugger off!

33:58.789 --> 34:00.123
I need to speak with you.

34:06.630 --> 34:09.132
- Give me your sword.
- I don't have a sword.

34:09.174 --> 34:12.803
- What kind of soldier has no weapon?
- I'm counting on to the treason.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.597
So, not a very good kind.

34:15.639 --> 34:18.308
I am looking for a pirate,
Captain Jack Sparrow?

34:19.518 --> 34:23.814
Today is your lucky day.
Because I just happen to be..

34:24.064 --> 34:27.234
Captain Jack Sparrow.

34:32.156 --> 34:33.699
No, it can't be.

34:33.991 --> 34:36.994
I've spent years searching for.. this?

34:37.369 --> 34:39.913
The great Jack Sparrow is not some
drunk in a cell.

34:40.414 --> 34:42.833
Do you even have a ship? A crew?

34:44.585 --> 34:45.711
Pants.

34:46.503 --> 34:49.256
A great pirate does not require
such intricacies.

34:49.339 --> 34:51.466
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for this moment?

34:51.466 --> 34:53.552
The risks I've taken to be here?

34:53.635 --> 34:56.972
- Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow?
- The real question is..

34:57.222 --> 34:59.600
- Who are you?
- My name is Henry Turner.

34:59.933 --> 35:01.935
Son of Will Turner and Elisabeth Swann.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.855
You are the evil spawn of them two?

35:06.023 --> 35:08.358
Does mommy ever ask about me?

35:08.400 --> 35:09.067
No.

35:09.109 --> 35:12.613
Go on. She calls my name in the sleep?

35:12.613 --> 35:14.072
She never spoke of you.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.242
Are you sure we're talking
about the same people?

35:17.534 --> 35:19.203
He is a haste eunuch.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.955
She has golden hair, stubborn,

35:21.997 --> 35:25.083
pouty lips. Neck like a giraffe.

35:25.167 --> 35:28.086
- And two of the those wonderful.
- Yes Yes, it's her.!

35:30.380 --> 35:31.423
I need you to listen Jack.

35:31.423 --> 35:33.300
Because at the moment
you're all I have got.

35:33.675 --> 35:37.137
I found the way to save my father.
There is one thing that can break his curse.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.931
And free him from the Dutchmen.

35:41.266 --> 35:42.893
The Trident of Poseidon.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.231
The treasure that can be found with...

35:47.272 --> 35:49.525
the map that no man can read.

35:52.444 --> 35:53.862
Never heard of it.

35:54.905 --> 35:56.782
There's a girl inside this prison Jack,

35:56.824 --> 35:57.908
who holds that map.

35:58.283 --> 36:00.994
The moon has time to blood,
the trident will be found.

36:01.119 --> 36:03.038
And you could be the
one who holds the sea.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.123
And with it become all
that you once were.

36:05.165 --> 36:06.166
The great.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.044
Jack!

36:10.045 --> 36:12.297
Oh, I'm so sorry. Were
you still talking?

36:14.967 --> 36:16.218
One more thing.

36:16.593 --> 36:19.638
A message from someone you know,
named Captain Salazar.

36:22.683 --> 36:24.935
I once knew a Spaniard named.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.396
Something in Spanish.

36:27.938 --> 36:30.941
<i>El Matador Del Mar.</i>
The butcher of the sea.

36:31.233 --> 36:34.945
Him? No, no, no. Quite
happily he's dead.

36:34.987 --> 36:37.447
Very, very dead. Ship went down..

36:37.489 --> 36:38.782
Inside the triangle.

36:39.741 --> 36:41.702
He's coming for you
Jack, to seek revenge.

36:41.743 --> 36:43.287
As the dead man's tale is told..

36:43.495 --> 36:44.955
I don't believe you.

36:47.666 --> 36:48.750
What did he say?

36:48.792 --> 36:50.377
He said your compass was the key,

36:50.419 --> 36:52.379
his escape. An army of dead,

36:52.421 --> 36:54.047
are coming straight for you, Jack.

36:54.256 --> 36:56.717
The Trident of Poseidon
is your only hope.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.220
Do we have an accord?

37:08.854 --> 37:12.232
- I am not going in there to tell him.
- It was your idea!

37:12.274 --> 37:15.319
No, it was my idea
for you to tell him.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.070
He likes you more than me.

37:17.112 --> 37:18.864
He doesn't like anybody.

37:41.762 --> 37:44.765
Sorry sir. We know you said
never to disturb you.

37:44.765 --> 37:46.767
Or to come in without good cause.

37:46.767 --> 37:48.602
Or to speak without first.

37:49.937 --> 37:51.939
To ask you now whether our,

37:51.939 --> 37:54.441
thoughts were absolutely necessary.

37:54.608 --> 37:56.693
Like the time the ship was on fire.

37:56.735 --> 37:58.821
That being an example
of necessary thought.

37:58.821 --> 38:02.032
So again, we do apologize
for starting that fire.

38:08.914 --> 38:09.957
Speak!

38:10.415 --> 38:14.086
It's the ships, sir.
They are being attacked by an enemy..

38:14.127 --> 38:17.798
- That takes the Riches.
- Kills without provocation.

38:17.798 --> 38:20.634
My ships?
Not possible!

38:20.676 --> 38:22.803
Three of them already been sunk, Sir.

38:23.011 --> 38:25.722
They have been sunk by a captain
called Salamander!

38:25.889 --> 38:27.266
Sandoval.

38:28.851 --> 38:30.018
Salazar!

38:30.227 --> 38:33.814
That's him, your sireness!
He leaves one man from each vessel..

38:33.814 --> 38:38.068
To tell the tale.
The entire fleet is being sunk.

38:38.443 --> 38:41.113
And we'll soon be dead.

38:41.947 --> 38:44.491
And quite possibly out of business.

38:50.747 --> 38:53.167
I'll be needing some
time with your witch..

39:08.182 --> 39:13.187
I have been expecting you Captain.
Perhaps you would like some tea.

39:16.857 --> 39:19.193
I shall pass, thank you kindly.

39:20.527 --> 39:23.864
The price of crossing my door
is blood, Captain.

39:24.781 --> 39:27.451
That explains
why you're not so busy.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.454
Everyone pays, eventually.

39:31.872 --> 39:34.541
Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.335
I saved you from the gallows.

39:36.502 --> 39:37.252
Remember?

39:37.336 --> 39:39.671
And I cursed your enemies.

39:39.796 --> 39:42.299
But now you come to me with fear.

39:42.341 --> 39:45.594
As the dead have taken
command over the sea.

39:45.636 --> 39:48.889
And what would the dead
be wanting with me?

39:48.931 --> 39:51.058
Not you, Captain.

39:51.350 --> 39:55.103
- They're searching for a Sparrow.
- Jack?

39:58.023 --> 40:04.154
Jack who sails for the trident..
With a girl and a Pearl.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.825
The trident can never be found.

40:11.161 --> 40:13.956
The trident is Jack's only hope.

40:14.081 --> 40:15.916
The dead are conquering the sea,

40:15.958 --> 40:18.377
unable to step on dry land.

40:21.296 --> 40:24.299
Maybe you should retire
to the country side.

40:26.593 --> 40:28.262
You mean grass?

40:29.137 --> 40:30.472
On a farm?

40:31.223 --> 40:33.809
Milking a cow, making cheese.

40:34.434 --> 40:39.606
- While they sink mi treasure?
- Ask yourself this, Captain.

40:40.190 --> 40:44.361
- Is this treasure worth dying for?
- I'm a pirate.

40:45.070 --> 40:48.323
Always will be! So how do I save,

40:48.365 --> 40:51.118
- what be mine.
- Jack held a compass.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.912
Which points you to the thing
you desire most.

40:53.996 --> 40:56.081
But betray the compass...

40:56.331 --> 40:58.750
And it releases your greatest fear.

40:58.792 --> 41:02.379
And a pirate's greatest fear
will be Salazar, is it?

41:05.924 --> 41:09.052
- How did you get this?
- I have my ways.

41:09.261 --> 41:12.222
Lead them to Jack
before he finds the trident.

41:12.472 --> 41:16.101
And all your treasure
will come back to you.

41:17.603 --> 41:20.147
Time to make a deal
with the dead.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.152
Come on, pirate.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.535
Hold on, stop.

41:38.749 --> 41:42.628
- Uncle Jack!
- Jackie boy, how is it going?

41:42.669 --> 41:44.463
Can't complain really. You?

41:44.505 --> 41:46.882
I've been waiting all morning in here,
for a beating.

41:47.007 --> 41:49.885
- But the service is terrible.
- Shameful.

41:50.385 --> 41:51.428
Jack.

41:53.305 --> 41:55.599
The oceans have turned to blood.

41:55.641 --> 41:58.560
Best to stay on dry land,
where it's safe.

41:59.144 --> 42:02.272
I'm about to be executed on dry land.

42:02.314 --> 42:03.232
Good point.

42:03.315 --> 42:05.484
Did I ever told you about the skeleton?

42:05.609 --> 42:06.902
Yes you have, many times.

42:06.944 --> 42:09.655
Skeleton goes into a
bar, orders a beer.

42:09.822 --> 42:11.073
And a mop.

42:13.242 --> 42:14.451
Funny as ever.

42:14.952 --> 42:16.078
Come on let's go!

42:17.246 --> 42:22.501
If they disembowel you, ask for Viktor.
He's got the softest hands.

42:22.876 --> 42:23.544
Thank you.

42:23.585 --> 42:26.380
And mention my name,
they won't cut your feet off.

42:46.817 --> 42:49.278
Come on.
You're first!

42:52.239 --> 42:54.575
And how would you like to die pirate?

42:54.616 --> 42:58.537
Hanging, firing squad or
a new invention.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.873
- The guillotine.
- Guillotine?

43:01.456 --> 43:03.500
Sounds french.
I love the French.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.502
Did you know they've
invented mayonnaise?

43:05.627 --> 43:07.880
How bad could it be?
It's French, right?

43:11.633 --> 43:14.094
Oh, my bad!
I change mi mind..

43:20.225 --> 43:23.437
No please have mercy for me.
I am a bet wetter.

43:40.621 --> 43:41.830
Oh, come on!

43:41.872 --> 43:44.458
I mean I have to walk upstairs
as well for this?

43:44.500 --> 43:48.045
- Bring the basket.
- Basket.. why?

43:49.755 --> 43:50.839
Step him down!

43:58.764 --> 44:01.141
Here's an idea.

44:01.266 --> 44:05.437
Why don't we try good old fashioned stoning?
I'd kill to be stoned right now.

44:05.687 --> 44:07.481
Gets the crowd involved, doesn't it?

44:07.773 --> 44:09.775
I should like to speak to Victor
in disembowelment.

44:09.775 --> 44:10.984
I should like to speak to Vic.

44:12.653 --> 44:14.655
I'm not the one who, complain normally,

44:14.822 --> 44:16.865
but this basket is full of heads.

44:26.250 --> 44:29.837
Final words of Carina Smyth. Shut up!

44:34.508 --> 44:36.468
The final words of Carina Smyth.

44:36.927 --> 44:39.263
It says.
I'm not a witch.

44:39.304 --> 44:42.683
But I forgive your common dim
witlessness and feeble brains.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.977
In short,
most of you have the mind of a goat.

44:44.977 --> 44:47.104
Pardon me sir.
It's not common practice...

44:47.145 --> 44:48.939
for those about to be executed.

44:48.981 --> 44:51.608
To be granted a last,
I don't know, some of a..?

44:51.650 --> 44:54.403
I believe I was making a point.
If you could just be patient.

44:54.695 --> 44:55.821
No.

44:55.988 --> 44:58.907
My head's about to be lopped off.
Hence the urgency.

44:58.949 --> 45:00.409
And my neck is to be broken.

45:00.450 --> 45:03.162
Did you know that on occasion,
the neck doesn't actually break.

45:03.203 --> 45:05.122
- It just hurts.
- What?

45:05.164 --> 45:06.165
Oh Yes.

45:06.456 --> 45:08.041
I have seen men swing for hours.

45:08.083 --> 45:09.585
Eyes bulging, tongues swelling.

45:09.668 --> 45:11.712
- Revolting gurgling sound.
- May I finish?

45:11.753 --> 45:13.297
No. You're lucky.

45:13.505 --> 45:14.840
Wish I was hung.

45:15.757 --> 45:18.302
- Kill the filthy pirate, I'll wait..
- The witch is first.

45:18.385 --> 45:20.345
I'm not a witch.
Did not you listen?

45:20.387 --> 45:22.514
Quite hard to listen
when you have the mind of a goat.

45:22.556 --> 45:24.308
Enough! Kill them both.

45:24.349 --> 45:25.767
Yes!

45:46.121 --> 45:49.958
Guess another news.
Did you think you could defeat us boy?

45:50.125 --> 45:52.544
No sir, I'm just a diversion.

45:53.378 --> 45:54.963
Fire!

46:20.823 --> 46:22.533
I still rather be stoned.

46:27.704 --> 46:29.164
Reload!

46:49.059 --> 46:50.102
Thank you.

47:00.028 --> 47:02.447
Come here. You Pirate Scum!

47:02.489 --> 47:03.490
Hey!

47:12.499 --> 47:14.585
What do you do?
No, no, no, no!

47:25.179 --> 47:26.346
Horses?

47:44.781 --> 47:47.034
- Thank you.
- You're welcome Mi lady.

47:48.869 --> 47:49.912
Got you!

47:55.834 --> 47:57.586
Who you'd come
tolling back traitor?

47:57.628 --> 47:58.921
The Turner boy gave us..

47:59.004 --> 48:01.381
10 pieces of silver to save your neck.

48:08.388 --> 48:10.140
From this moment on
we're to be allies.

48:10.182 --> 48:11.642
Considering where your left hand is.

48:11.683 --> 48:13.936
- I'd say we're more than that.
- We'd find the Trident together.

48:13.936 --> 48:14.770
Do I have your word?

48:14.811 --> 48:16.647
You're holding everything but my word.

48:16.897 --> 48:19.233
Then I bestow upon you
the honor of saving me.

48:19.274 --> 48:20.400
For a small donation.

48:20.567 --> 48:22.945
You expect us to pay you to save you?

48:24.404 --> 48:25.405
Yes!

48:27.157 --> 48:28.742
For a mere 10 pieces.

48:34.998 --> 48:36.166
Madness!

48:36.500 --> 48:38.877
- We won't more than 5.
- Well, then.

48:39.002 --> 48:40.295
8 it is.

48:40.587 --> 48:41.922
Perhaps we could discuss this later.

48:41.922 --> 48:43.757
As I am having trouble
here wasting your...

48:43.799 --> 48:46.927
- That is my stern.
- Are you sure?

48:47.010 --> 48:49.888
- Positive.
- Well, look at this.

48:50.681 --> 48:53.433
If I kill the coward. The witch hangs.

48:53.475 --> 48:56.436
- Two for the price of one.
- Please don't let go of me.

48:56.436 --> 48:58.230
It might be difficult once he kills me.

49:03.819 --> 49:07.197
Gentlemen, these two
prisoners will lead us,

49:07.197 --> 49:08.615
to the trident.

49:10.617 --> 49:14.705
Captain. Do you really think
we can find the trident?

49:14.746 --> 49:16.081
Master Gibbs, you're worrywart.

49:16.165 --> 49:18.667
There is nothing to be concerned about.

49:21.420 --> 49:25.465
- What could possibly go wrong, right?
- So this was your plan?

49:25.507 --> 49:27.009
To be tortured and killed by pirates?

49:27.092 --> 49:28.385
You said you needed a ship.

49:28.385 --> 49:30.804
- You call this a ship?
- Cut the string!

49:39.438 --> 49:41.398
Prepare them.

49:57.789 --> 50:00.042
My dear beloved crew. Finally...

50:00.083 --> 50:01.001
<i>Today is..</i>

50:01.043 --> 50:02.044
<i>DYING GULL.</i>

50:12.262 --> 50:13.347
Something's gone wrong.

50:32.866 --> 50:34.409
She floats!

50:38.288 --> 50:40.290
Ship dead ahead.

50:47.756 --> 50:48.757
Sir.

50:50.384 --> 50:54.137
We would never
question your reason as a captain.

50:54.179 --> 50:55.347
But, however..

50:56.181 --> 50:58.892
Is there a reason as captain,
you've chosen..

50:58.934 --> 51:00.769
To sail in this unreasonable direction?

51:01.687 --> 51:03.814
Tell the men to prepare to be boarded.

51:03.856 --> 51:04.940
To stand their ground.

51:04.982 --> 51:06.650
And show no fear.

51:12.322 --> 51:15.909
Capitan! A ship sails towards us.

51:42.060 --> 51:45.647
Captain Salazar. I hear you've
been looking for Jack Sparrow.

52:09.296 --> 52:11.048
Hold point!

52:13.926 --> 52:15.511
And await orders.

52:36.365 --> 52:40.118
My name is Captain Barbarossa.
And I stand before you,

52:40.160 --> 52:43.497
- with cordial intent.
- I don't need any cordial intent.

52:43.705 --> 52:47.668
Do you hear that?
This pirate wishes to be cordial.

52:47.793 --> 52:51.547
So let me show you
what my cordiality is.

52:51.588 --> 52:53.799
Every time I tap my sword.

52:54.299 --> 52:57.594
One of your men will die,
So I suggest you speak quickly.

53:01.723 --> 53:04.059
Might want to go a bit faster Captain.

53:07.729 --> 53:11.859
- Where is Jack Sparrow?
- Jack be sailing for the trident.

53:11.900 --> 53:15.320
- No. The sea belongs to the dead.
- The Trident controls the seas.

53:15.445 --> 53:19.032
No, no. There is no treasure.

53:19.074 --> 53:20.492
There is no treasure.

53:20.534 --> 53:23.370
I can't save him.
He'll die with you.

53:23.412 --> 53:25.664
I be the only one
that can lead you to him.

53:27.291 --> 53:30.544
I declare you should have
Jack's life by sunrise tomorrow.

53:30.586 --> 53:33.922
Or you can take me on then.
Do we have an accord?

53:40.846 --> 53:44.391
Tail me to him.
And you will live to tell the tale.

53:44.808 --> 53:46.643
You have my word.

53:46.810 --> 53:50.147
I thank you on behalf of my crew.

53:54.485 --> 53:59.156
Okay. You can take what's left them.
The living come aboard.

54:07.498 --> 54:09.708
Carina, we haven't got much time,

54:09.750 --> 54:11.293
the dead are sailing straight for us.

54:11.335 --> 54:13.545
- Is that so?
- Yes, I've spoken to them.

54:13.629 --> 54:14.630
You spoken to them?

54:14.671 --> 54:16.882
Have you spoken to the Krakens
and the mermaids as well?

54:17.174 --> 54:18.467
Krakens don't speak,
everyone knows that.

54:18.509 --> 54:21.220
Of course, I never
should have saved you.

54:21.803 --> 54:24.556
Last night there was a blood moon,
just as you described.

54:24.598 --> 54:25.807
Tell me what to reveal.

54:25.849 --> 54:27.267
And why should I trust you?

54:27.434 --> 54:29.394
You trusted me to hold your porch,
remember?

54:29.520 --> 54:30.395
It was my stern.

54:30.437 --> 54:32.356
Clearly you need to spend
more time at sea.

54:32.397 --> 54:34.608
Tell me what you found
and I promise to help you.

54:34.650 --> 54:35.484
I don't need any help.

54:35.526 --> 54:37.277
Then why did come to me Carina?

54:37.694 --> 54:39.446
Why are we together
in the middle of the sea..

54:39.446 --> 54:40.823
Chasing the same treasure?

54:43.826 --> 54:45.536
The moon revealed a clue..

54:45.828 --> 54:47.913
To release the power of the sea.

54:48.497 --> 54:51.583
- One must divide.
- Divide?

54:51.750 --> 54:55.462
- What does it mean?
- I'm not sure yet.

54:57.381 --> 54:58.841
Then we'll find out.

55:00.759 --> 55:03.804
- There is no map in this map.
- Give me my diary.

55:05.556 --> 55:07.391
Give me the map no man can read.

55:07.432 --> 55:08.183
If you could read it.

55:08.267 --> 55:09.852
Then it wouldn't be call the map
that no man can read.

55:09.852 --> 55:11.812
I beg you please,
don't argue with her.

55:12.271 --> 55:14.398
Most of the men on
this ship can't read.

55:15.149 --> 55:16.900
Which makes all maps.

55:16.942 --> 55:18.902
Maps that no man can read.

55:18.986 --> 55:21.697
Well if you can't read it,
then you've no use for it, or me.

55:22.906 --> 55:25.951
Let me start again.
Show me the map.

55:26.743 --> 55:28.912
I can't. It does not even exist.

55:29.496 --> 55:32.166
- She's a witch!
- I'm an astronomer.

55:33.375 --> 55:36.670
- She breeds donkeys.
- What? No.

55:36.712 --> 55:40.424
- An astronomer contemplates the sky.
- Yay, on a donkey.

55:40.424 --> 55:44.094
- No, there's no donkey!
- Well then how do you breed then?

55:44.469 --> 55:48.599
Allows me to simplify this equation.
Give me the map.

55:50.309 --> 55:55.814
Or I'll kill.. him, or kill him.

55:58.150 --> 56:00.944
Go on then. You're bluffing.

56:02.237 --> 56:03.822
And you're blushing.

56:05.616 --> 56:06.867
Throw him over.

56:11.371 --> 56:13.415
We call this keel hauling.

56:14.249 --> 56:16.627
Young Henry will be tossed over.

56:18.086 --> 56:20.589
And he will be dragged under the ship.

56:20.797 --> 56:21.840
Alright.

56:22.341 --> 56:24.760
- What're you waiting for?
- He doesn't appear to be.

56:26.011 --> 56:28.639
No. Not bluffing me.
He's trying to say something.

56:28.889 --> 56:31.517
No, no, we don't have any
food on board. Sorry.

56:32.643 --> 56:34.478
If he's lucky, he'll drown,

56:34.520 --> 56:36.980
before the barnacles
shred him to ribbon.

56:37.147 --> 56:39.399
- Bernacles.
- Like a thousands knives,

56:39.441 --> 56:42.444
across your back. And of course,
the blood attracts sharks.

56:42.486 --> 56:43.111
Sharks?

56:43.153 --> 56:45.656
- Shark of the bow!
- Where?

56:45.781 --> 56:48.992
I would say that swimming
is no longer his primary concern.

56:49.493 --> 56:50.661
The map is there.

56:51.203 --> 56:53.288
- Where?
- On the tip of your finger?

56:53.330 --> 56:55.666
No. In the heavens.

56:55.958 --> 56:57.668
That dairy will lead me to a map,

56:57.668 --> 56:58.710
hidden in the stars.

56:58.836 --> 57:01.338
Let him up, I'll find it tonight.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.131
Sorry, can't bring him up.

57:03.173 --> 57:04.508
Look for yourself.

57:07.719 --> 57:10.389
As I said..
Blushing!

57:16.687 --> 57:18.147
Filthy pirate!

57:22.776 --> 57:26.238
The sea has turned to blood,
a sailor washed ashore..

57:26.280 --> 57:29.825
Talking about the Trident.
He was looking for Jack Sparrow.

57:29.992 --> 57:32.786
The same pirate who saved a witch
from the gallows.

57:33.120 --> 57:36.206
- She's no Witch.
- But you are.

57:37.457 --> 57:41.503
- And you're going to help us.
- You afraid, Lieutenant?

57:42.171 --> 57:46.091
As ships burning the night, you want
to know if you can save your own.

57:47.134 --> 57:52.764
- If the trident is real?
- You are going to read that wall for me.

57:52.973 --> 57:55.642
Or you will die.
The British Empire will have..

57:55.684 --> 57:59.897
The trident and rule the sea. I want
to know where that pirate is going,

57:59.938 --> 58:01.273
with that witch.

58:02.441 --> 58:06.945
Your destiny is in these stars.
I will set your course.

58:32.554 --> 58:34.139
No Spaghetti walls.

58:35.307 --> 58:36.850
Why did I bother coming to you?

58:36.975 --> 58:39.269
The dead are haunting us down
and you do nothing.

58:39.686 --> 58:42.940
- Nothing, You call this nothing?
- You're drunk and you're sleeping.

58:43.023 --> 58:46.902
My point exactly,
I am doing two things at once.

58:47.194 --> 58:49.655
You can't save the unsavable mate.

58:51.114 --> 58:53.075
Like it or not Jack,
you're going to help me.

58:53.116 --> 58:55.077
I will break my father's curse.

58:57.621 --> 58:59.790
Next time you raise a sword, boy.

59:00.749 --> 59:02.835
Be the last to die.

59:19.059 --> 59:22.938
Might I suggest you entice her
with a bit of flattery.

59:24.148 --> 59:25.983
I am here for my father, nothing more.

59:26.817 --> 59:29.695
I knew it, absolutely
smitten with that.

59:30.362 --> 59:33.866
Now, bit of discretion
when goes into brunette.

59:33.907 --> 59:35.784
Never presume her sister.

59:35.826 --> 59:39.246
But if you can not avoid
the charming sister.

59:39.746 --> 59:41.832
Kill the brother, savvy?

59:43.667 --> 59:45.377
No, I do not savvy.

59:47.421 --> 59:51.675
Who hurt you? By the way that
little slim of knowledge.

59:51.758 --> 59:55.429
- Has cost you five pieces.
- I am not paying you for that.

59:55.470 --> 59:57.222
Never say that to a woman.

1:00:12.321 --> 1:00:15.407
Just because you can't see something
does not mean it's not there.

1:00:16.825 --> 1:00:17.993
Like the map?

1:00:20.162 --> 1:00:21.538
We have to find it.

1:00:22.748 --> 1:00:24.541
It's the only link to who I am.

1:00:25.292 --> 1:00:26.960
Who my father was.

1:00:28.337 --> 1:00:29.671
So we both spent our lives,

1:00:29.713 --> 1:00:31.089
searching for our fathers.

1:00:32.591 --> 1:00:34.593
Perhaps you and I
are closer than you think.

1:00:51.485 --> 1:00:53.946
The sun is up. And so is up time.

1:00:56.824 --> 1:00:59.284
I'm not to disagree,
but the precision of our accord,

1:00:59.409 --> 1:01:00.661
Ends at sunrise.

1:01:00.702 --> 1:01:03.914
This be will light,
far from a fully rising sun.

1:01:03.914 --> 1:01:07.501
- And I know you to be a man of honor.
- Honor, you know nothing of me.

1:01:07.543 --> 1:01:10.003
I know what it likes to be
bested by Jack Sparrow.

1:01:10.045 --> 1:01:13.382
- He's an enemy to us both.
- You don't know who I am.

1:01:15.008 --> 1:01:19.638
I've heard stories of a mighty
Spanish captain. El Matador Del Mar.

1:01:19.805 --> 1:01:23.892
A man who skirts the sea.
Hunted and killed thousands of men.

1:01:23.892 --> 1:01:25.227
No, no, no.
Men, no, no.

1:01:25.269 --> 1:01:26.270
No.

1:01:26.937 --> 1:01:28.689
Pirates! Eh?

1:01:31.024 --> 1:01:32.317
Pirates.

1:01:37.739 --> 1:01:41.076
Pirates had infected the seas
for generations.

1:01:41.118 --> 1:01:44.371
Taken the life of my father
and his father before.

1:01:44.663 --> 1:01:48.083
So I vowed to end this plague
once and for all.

1:01:48.125 --> 1:01:51.545
And that's what I did,
I destroyed dozens of ships.

1:01:57.467 --> 1:02:01.597
The last ones joined together
to try and defeat me.

1:02:02.097 --> 1:02:04.683
But they soon realized
it was hopeless.

1:02:16.361 --> 1:02:18.989
Nothing could stop the Silent Mary.

1:02:20.032 --> 1:02:21.867
Hit them below the water line.

1:02:21.909 --> 1:02:23.076
Vamo, vamo!

1:02:26.121 --> 1:02:28.457
Hang on tight!

1:02:37.090 --> 1:02:40.677
The sea was finally.. pure.

1:02:41.595 --> 1:02:45.140
Their wretched flags
will no longer stain the sea.

1:02:53.690 --> 1:02:55.275
They are begging for mercy.

1:02:56.485 --> 1:02:59.154
Mercy?

1:03:00.572 --> 1:03:01.990
There's no mercy.

1:03:08.247 --> 1:03:09.456
Make ready.

1:03:16.046 --> 1:03:18.173
- Adios!
- Fire!

1:03:27.307 --> 1:03:29.518
It's up to you now Jack.

1:03:31.645 --> 1:03:35.816
This compass.. points towards
what you want most.

1:03:37.943 --> 1:03:40.821
Never betray it.

1:04:11.977 --> 1:04:14.313
The Devil's Triangle.

1:04:15.689 --> 1:04:20.360
The last of their ships were
burning before my eyes.

1:04:21.904 --> 1:04:26.033
And in that moment of... Victori.

1:04:26.492 --> 1:04:28.285
It's when I heard it.

1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:29.661
Hey!

1:04:29.995 --> 1:04:32.122
Hold on,

1:04:32.456 --> 1:04:35.626
One ship was trying to escape
through the smoke.

1:04:35.792 --> 1:04:38.212
It's a lovely day for a sail, ain't it?

1:04:38.420 --> 1:04:39.546
And there.

1:04:40.005 --> 1:04:44.968
In the crow's nest,
there was this young pirate boy.

1:04:45.010 --> 1:04:47.304
The way I see it,
it just the two of us left.

1:04:48.096 --> 1:04:50.557
If you surrender to me now,
I'll let you live, simple.

1:04:50.599 --> 1:04:53.894
He stood there, looking like.
A little bird..

1:04:54.770 --> 1:04:57.481
And from that day he earned himself
a name that would...

1:04:57.689 --> 1:05:00.025
haunt me for the rest of my days.

1:05:01.902 --> 1:05:03.278
<i>Jack de "Sparrow".</i>

1:05:03.737 --> 1:05:07.533
Right, you surrender to me now,
and I'll let you live.

1:05:08.867 --> 1:05:11.078
I shall let you live.

1:05:17.251 --> 1:05:18.544
This boy.

1:05:18.794 --> 1:05:21.129
This boy was mocking my power.

1:05:21.171 --> 1:05:24.299
So I test him.
Knowing that I would run..

1:05:24.341 --> 1:05:29.054
My knife along his neck, and when
he was dead, I would finish finally..

1:05:29.096 --> 1:05:30.639
With pirates's life.

1:05:35.686 --> 1:05:36.812
Follow him men!

1:05:38.147 --> 1:05:40.732
To the gutholes.
Thread some lines.

1:05:43.152 --> 1:05:44.695
Prepare the boot leg!

1:05:44.820 --> 1:05:45.863
Port side.

1:05:48.073 --> 1:05:49.199
Throw it now.

1:06:11.388 --> 1:06:12.514
<i>They're turning around.</i>

1:07:22.334 --> 1:07:23.502
What's all this?

1:07:27.005 --> 1:07:29.508
Tribute... Sir.

1:07:59.413 --> 1:08:01.248
He took everything from me.

1:08:01.999 --> 1:08:05.002
And filled me with.. rage.

1:08:07.754 --> 1:08:09.047
And pain.

1:08:11.049 --> 1:08:13.552
And he is where the tale ends.

1:08:16.138 --> 1:08:18.056
Not yet Capitan, there.

1:08:18.974 --> 1:08:20.684
Found as promised.

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:46.835
So she's saying
she's got the map,

1:08:46.877 --> 1:08:48.420
but she's the only one
who can follow it?

1:08:48.420 --> 1:08:50.839
- So we should...?
- Leave her be.

1:08:50.881 --> 1:08:53.550
- She will take us to the Trident.
- You've been saying that for hours.

1:08:53.550 --> 1:08:57.095
Two things we know are true,
the stars don't shine by day.

1:08:57.262 --> 1:08:59.014
And she forgot a donkey.

1:08:59.431 --> 1:09:03.560
How can we go to a spot,
where no land exists on any map?

1:09:05.145 --> 1:09:07.815
This chronometer
keeps the exact time in London.

1:09:08.148 --> 1:09:09.900
I'm using it to make
an altitude measurement..

1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:11.401
To determine longitude.

1:09:11.985 --> 1:09:14.488
Only then will we find
our exact spot to see.

1:09:14.530 --> 1:09:17.074
So you expect to find the trident
with a timepiece?

1:09:17.157 --> 1:09:18.200
Yes.

1:09:18.951 --> 1:09:21.036
My calculations are precise and true.

1:09:21.328 --> 1:09:22.704
I'm not only an Astronomer.

1:09:22.746 --> 1:09:24.248
I am also a horologist.

1:09:29.711 --> 1:09:31.088
No shame in that dear.

1:09:31.338 --> 1:09:34.550
We'll all have to earn a living, eh?

1:09:36.134 --> 1:09:39.096
No, I'm a horologist.

1:09:39.096 --> 1:09:42.057
So was my mum.
But she didn't cry a bad as lad as you.

1:09:42.266 --> 1:09:44.643
You saying your mother
was academically inclined?

1:09:44.685 --> 1:09:49.106
More like a horizontally, reclined.

1:09:50.107 --> 1:09:52.442
Horology is the study of time.

1:09:52.484 --> 1:09:54.653
And she was always looking at watch.

1:09:54.903 --> 1:09:56.113
I can vouch for that.

1:09:57.948 --> 1:10:01.410
So no one can find the X,
but you, right?

1:10:01.702 --> 1:10:02.327
No.

1:10:02.369 --> 1:10:04.621
- And the donkey?
- Ship to the f!

1:10:07.166 --> 1:10:08.167
Salazar.

1:10:12.462 --> 1:10:15.090
Jack, the dead will not rest
until they get their revenge.

1:10:15.132 --> 1:10:16.133
Dead?

1:10:16.175 --> 1:10:17.050
No, no, the dead.

1:10:17.092 --> 1:10:19.761
- Were never part of this deal.
- We should've never follow.

1:10:19.803 --> 1:10:22.014
A luck less pirate and a witch to sea.

1:10:22.055 --> 1:10:23.849
Right, that's it. Kill them all.

1:10:24.766 --> 1:10:27.728
Kill me and, and..
I will be dead.

1:10:28.228 --> 1:10:32.232
And then the other dead won't
be able to have the revenge.

1:10:33.233 --> 1:10:34.610
Against me,

1:10:34.860 --> 1:10:36.445
- I'd be dead.
- What?

1:10:36.528 --> 1:10:38.447
- Which will anger them even more.
- He's right.

1:10:38.489 --> 1:10:39.239
That's right.

1:10:39.406 --> 1:10:41.241
Are all pirates this stupid?

1:10:41.241 --> 1:10:43.243
Yes.

1:10:43.327 --> 1:10:44.953
What are we going to do?

1:10:45.746 --> 1:10:46.914
As Captain.

1:10:48.207 --> 1:10:49.791
Might I suggest.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.465
Mutiny?
You had to suggest a mutiny?

1:10:56.507 --> 1:10:58.008
Carina, the dead are coming.

1:10:58.091 --> 1:11:01.470
Well. I choose not to believe in
supernatural nonsense.

1:11:01.512 --> 1:11:03.180
Do you not see what's behind us?

1:11:17.152 --> 1:11:18.987
- Drop them!
- Si.

1:11:19.029 --> 1:11:20.280
Drop them!

1:11:27.454 --> 1:11:28.330
What are you doing?

1:11:28.372 --> 1:11:29.915
Men on that ship are looking for Jack.

1:11:29.915 --> 1:11:31.166
And Jack is on this boat.

1:11:31.208 --> 1:11:32.417
I'm going to swim for it.

1:11:32.501 --> 1:11:35.337
How dare you do exactly
what I'd do if I were you?

1:11:35.462 --> 1:11:38.048
- Carina stop!
- No, no, no, don't stop.

1:11:38.298 --> 1:11:40.551
- This has gone far enough.
- No, it has not.

1:11:41.093 --> 1:11:44.012
Listen not to him,
carry on, carry on.

1:11:50.310 --> 1:11:53.689
- Why, she was almost finished.
- I saw her ankles.

1:11:53.772 --> 1:11:56.316
You'd have to seen a lot more,
if you kept the cakeholes shut.

1:12:14.459 --> 1:12:16.128
Kill the sparrow.

1:12:32.978 --> 1:12:34.771
That's not good, is it?

1:12:35.606 --> 1:12:38.317
Keep rowing man. Faster!

1:12:38.484 --> 1:12:40.319
No, that's it.

1:12:41.445 --> 1:12:42.779
I'm going with her.

1:12:43.614 --> 1:12:46.909
You would leave me
for some horologist in her knickers?

1:12:46.950 --> 1:12:47.951
Yes.

1:12:49.453 --> 1:12:51.121
You men are all alike.

1:13:01.298 --> 1:13:02.299
Shark.

1:13:27.366 --> 1:13:28.450
Henry!

1:13:50.806 --> 1:13:52.182
Doesn't seem to be working.

1:13:52.182 --> 1:13:54.309
No, we'll be fine, we'll be fine.

1:14:14.121 --> 1:14:16.206
- How did they do that?
- We have to swim.

1:14:16.415 --> 1:14:18.542
I will distract him.

1:14:24.047 --> 1:14:25.048
Now!

1:15:05.672 --> 1:15:07.341
Henry!

1:15:58.016 --> 1:16:00.811
Hi.. Jack Sparrow.

1:16:02.855 --> 1:16:04.565
Jack Sparrow.

1:16:04.606 --> 1:16:05.691
Spanish?

1:16:13.323 --> 1:16:14.867
- Ghosts.
- Ah-ow.

1:16:15.659 --> 1:16:17.744
They are unable to step on land.

1:16:18.495 --> 1:16:20.372
- I knew that.
- Ghosts!

1:16:24.168 --> 1:16:27.504
- Carina!
- You will soon pay for what you did to me.

1:16:27.546 --> 1:16:29.965
No no no. There is no
need to bother really.

1:16:30.007 --> 1:16:31.717
- Carina!
- I have no time to chat.

1:16:31.758 --> 1:16:35.554
- Because mi map just ran away.
- I'll be waiting for you.

1:16:36.096 --> 1:16:39.141
Why would you be waiting for me?
Why would he be waiting for me?

1:16:55.949 --> 1:16:57.117
Pirates!

1:17:11.882 --> 1:17:12.883
Scrum.

1:17:13.342 --> 1:17:14.218
Captain?

1:17:14.301 --> 1:17:16.845
Jack always told me that if anything
should ever happened to him.

1:17:16.845 --> 1:17:20.808
- He wanted you to be captain.
- Yes, but the men voted for you, yes?

1:17:20.849 --> 1:17:22.309
Well, you've got a captain's hat!

1:17:22.351 --> 1:17:24.686
"Be that as it may"
them were his wishes.

1:17:24.728 --> 1:17:26.897
So be a good lad
and take the wheel.

1:17:26.939 --> 1:17:28.065
And.. you,

1:17:29.274 --> 1:17:34.571
- Take the captain's hat.
- Perish my rhythm.

1:17:37.616 --> 1:17:39.409
We will beat your captain to death.

1:17:39.409 --> 1:17:41.370
Until he reveals where
they are heading.

1:17:43.914 --> 1:17:47.167
- Carina!
- I know what's ailing you boy.

1:17:47.209 --> 1:17:49.336
You've got the unstretchable itch.

1:17:49.670 --> 1:17:52.297
Carina is the only one
who can help us find the Trident.

1:17:52.422 --> 1:17:54.591
- And I'm not in love with her.
- Love?

1:17:54.883 --> 1:17:56.969
Who said anything about love,
what are you talking about?

1:17:56.969 --> 1:17:58.011
The unstretchable itch.

1:17:58.345 --> 1:18:00.430
Scabies, I'm talking about scabies.

1:18:00.472 --> 1:18:02.724
Small mites that burrow under the skin.

1:18:02.975 --> 1:18:04.977
Certainly annoying me,
has done for years.

1:18:05.018 --> 1:18:06.145
Oh, no!

1:18:06.186 --> 1:18:08.522
<i>Hangman's Bay,
STRANGERS NOT WELCOME.</i>

1:18:08.814 --> 1:18:09.982
Help!

1:18:10.983 --> 1:18:13.360
- Help me! Help!
- Carina!

1:18:14.444 --> 1:18:16.989
- Henry, help me.
- Help her!

1:18:18.490 --> 1:18:19.950
By rule of the King.

1:18:19.992 --> 1:18:22.077
I sentence you all to death.

1:18:22.870 --> 1:18:27.457
I think we should tell each other
where our treasures are buried..

1:18:27.457 --> 1:18:29.459
Just in case one of us survives.

1:18:29.501 --> 1:18:30.752
Oh, good idea.

1:18:31.253 --> 1:18:34.423
- You go first.
- My treasure is buried..

1:18:34.464 --> 1:18:36.925
Between two cross palm trees
in an unmarked grave in Aruba.

1:18:36.967 --> 1:18:39.303
What about yours?

1:18:40.471 --> 1:18:41.847
I haven't got any.

1:18:41.889 --> 1:18:43.599
You promised me Jack's blood.

1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:45.017
But Jack is trapped!

1:18:45.476 --> 1:18:48.770
- He can never escape the island.
- Piece of land.

1:18:55.027 --> 1:18:56.028
Hello.

1:19:00.532 --> 1:19:02.117
I upheld our deal.

1:19:02.242 --> 1:19:04.036
Mi men and myself will go ashore.

1:19:04.203 --> 1:19:06.288
The traitor will be yours.

1:19:06.622 --> 1:19:08.540
- On mi honor.
- Honor?

1:19:09.124 --> 1:19:11.126
What honor, hombre? What honor?

1:19:11.251 --> 1:19:13.837
- You don't know what the honor is.
- Spare mi my life.

1:19:14.171 --> 1:19:16.507
And I'll fetch you little Sparrow.

1:19:18.884 --> 1:19:20.260
An accord?

1:19:34.525 --> 1:19:38.070
<i>Wake up Sparrow.</i>

1:19:41.406 --> 1:19:44.159
<i>Wake up Sparrow.</i>

1:19:45.994 --> 1:19:47.538
<i>Wake up, Sparrow.</i>

1:19:48.038 --> 1:19:51.875
- It's time to pay your debt.
- Pig?

1:19:52.709 --> 1:19:53.752
Pig Kelly?

1:19:55.003 --> 1:19:57.965
- Mi old mate.
- Mate?

1:19:58.298 --> 1:19:59.967
Do you hear that boys?

1:20:00.592 --> 1:20:03.929
This pirate owes me a
blunder of silver.

1:20:03.971 --> 1:20:06.974
And luck has brought him to
Hangman's Bay.

1:20:07.015 --> 1:20:10.018
Where he can settle his
debt, here and now.

1:20:10.936 --> 1:20:14.022
And I will, I will Pig.
Name your price.

1:20:14.064 --> 1:20:16.859
Her name is Beatrice.

1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:22.364
And she is my poor widowed sister.

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:26.535
What, what is that?

1:20:26.577 --> 1:20:28.495
She's been looking for
a respectable man.

1:20:29.454 --> 1:20:32.040
- But you'll have to do.
- Royce, let's get on with this.

1:20:32.166 --> 1:20:33.917
No why? Why..?

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:36.503
To make an honest woman of her, Jack.

1:20:36.587 --> 1:20:39.339
Congratulations, it's your wedding day.

1:20:40.632 --> 1:20:41.592
Let us begin?

1:20:41.633 --> 1:20:44.428
We will honeymoon in the barn.

1:20:48.807 --> 1:20:51.310
No, no, no. Pig.

1:20:51.351 --> 1:20:54.563
How can I honestly make an
honest woman out of it?

1:20:54.605 --> 1:20:56.482
That, her.
I mean. Her.

1:21:00.194 --> 1:21:02.738
- What are those things?
- Our children.

1:21:03.363 --> 1:21:05.532
Best not look them in the eye.

1:21:05.616 --> 1:21:07.784
Bring the best man
and the bridesmaid.

1:21:09.244 --> 1:21:10.579
I looked it in the eye.

1:21:10.621 --> 1:21:12.873
Place your hand on the Bible.

1:21:13.707 --> 1:21:15.709
- I have got scabies.
- So do I.

1:21:16.710 --> 1:21:18.879
Place your hand on the Bible.

1:21:19.588 --> 1:21:20.881
I'm a bed wetter.

1:21:21.340 --> 1:21:22.758
Say I do.

1:21:23.842 --> 1:21:27.054
- Or I'll put a bullet in your skull.
- Jack, they are going to kill us.

1:21:27.095 --> 1:21:28.680
- I don't care!
- Just say I do.

1:21:28.764 --> 1:21:31.475
- Last chance Jack.
- Wait. Surely..

1:21:31.725 --> 1:21:34.311
- This is not legal.
- This is not legal.

1:21:34.645 --> 1:21:35.771
He's right.

1:21:35.854 --> 1:21:38.273
Does any man here
object to the nuptials?

1:21:38.857 --> 1:21:41.485
- I do.
- Congratulations.

1:21:41.527 --> 1:21:43.070
You may kiss the bride.

1:21:55.541 --> 1:21:58.669
Do you like seafood, do you?

1:22:02.089 --> 1:22:04.383
Jack. We meet again.

1:22:05.467 --> 1:22:06.593
Hector!

1:22:06.885 --> 1:22:09.429
This is mi best as my
in the whole world.

1:22:09.471 --> 1:22:12.224
I always knew you'll settle down,
eventually.

1:22:12.266 --> 1:22:13.642
Did you bring me a gift?

1:22:15.936 --> 1:22:17.187
That'll do.

1:22:19.565 --> 1:22:23.110
You look marvelous.
Got quite a spring in your step.

1:22:24.194 --> 1:22:25.529
Has your leg grown back?

1:22:25.654 --> 1:22:27.990
Captain, shouldn't we be getting
back to Salazar.

1:22:28.282 --> 1:22:30.659
Trade Mr. Sparrow's
life in for our own?

1:22:30.951 --> 1:22:34.997
I know that we could.
But I've come for the Trident Poseidon.

1:22:35.956 --> 1:22:37.541
You're gonna double cross the dead?

1:22:37.624 --> 1:22:38.709
You did promise!

1:22:38.917 --> 1:22:42.838
And with it I'll gut the dead
that stole my command of the sea.

1:22:42.921 --> 1:22:45.007
As much as I love this plan.

1:22:45.257 --> 1:22:48.927
No vessel can outrun that
wretched haul of the ship.

1:22:48.969 --> 1:22:50.596
But there be one, Jack.

1:22:50.637 --> 1:22:52.055
The fastest ship I know.

1:22:52.097 --> 1:22:55.976
The pearl, trapped in that bottle
by Blackbeard.

1:22:56.059 --> 1:22:57.728
Five winters ago.

1:22:59.605 --> 1:23:02.649
By the power of that
blaggerd sovereign blade..

1:23:02.733 --> 1:23:08.238
I hereby release the Black Pearl,
to her former and rightful glory.

1:23:19.208 --> 1:23:20.501
Get rid of the..

1:23:23.295 --> 1:23:24.004
It's coming.

1:23:24.087 --> 1:23:26.006
It is coming!
It is coming! Coming!

1:23:31.011 --> 1:23:33.430
Set aside.

1:23:34.932 --> 1:23:36.350
It's coming!

1:23:52.032 --> 1:23:53.534
It's shrunken.

1:23:54.159 --> 1:23:55.828
Why doesn't it unshrink?

1:23:56.829 --> 1:23:58.413
Maybe it's cold.

1:23:58.539 --> 1:24:00.082
She needs the sea.

1:24:14.388 --> 1:24:16.014
She was a fine ship.

1:24:54.595 --> 1:24:57.222
There be room for only one captain.

1:24:59.850 --> 1:25:03.437
- Filthy beast.
- Time to race the dead.

1:25:10.235 --> 1:25:12.446
The only safe place is the land.

1:25:12.571 --> 1:25:14.364
Why are we going away from the land?

1:25:14.823 --> 1:25:15.824
Nobody knows?

1:25:16.366 --> 1:25:18.744
Captain, your map is incomplete.

1:25:19.036 --> 1:25:21.788
I can take us to the Trident,
if you'd only trust me.

1:25:22.789 --> 1:25:24.958
Did you not hear anything I just said?

1:25:25.334 --> 1:25:26.502
So you be saying.

1:25:26.543 --> 1:25:29.046
Is that star pretending to be a map?

1:25:29.213 --> 1:25:31.632
Sir, there is no island,
on any map,

1:25:31.673 --> 1:25:33.592
to support what the woman says.

1:25:33.634 --> 1:25:35.469
Captain, you don't have
to understand her.

1:25:35.636 --> 1:25:37.095
Just believe her.

1:25:38.222 --> 1:25:39.640
Any one?

1:25:51.735 --> 1:25:55.113
We had something sharp,
I could pick that lock.

1:25:56.490 --> 1:25:58.492
You are not gonna find
anything sharp in here.

1:26:20.889 --> 1:26:21.932
Release them.

1:26:24.184 --> 1:26:28.605
Sir, you wouldn't allow a woman
to steer your ship?

1:26:28.647 --> 1:26:31.859
She will follow her star.
Or we'll all die together.

1:26:51.503 --> 1:26:54.506
The Black Pearl.
She sails again.

1:26:54.548 --> 1:26:56.383
Yeah!

1:26:57.593 --> 1:27:00.220
This ship. Those ghosts.

1:27:01.221 --> 1:27:03.015
There can be no logical explanation.

1:27:03.056 --> 1:27:05.100
Myths of the sea are real, Carina.

1:27:05.434 --> 1:27:07.478
I'm glad you can finally
see you were wrong.

1:27:07.603 --> 1:27:08.604
Wrong?

1:27:10.731 --> 1:27:12.065
Perhaps I had some doubts.

1:27:12.107 --> 1:27:13.984
This is the worst apology
I've ever heard.

1:27:14.067 --> 1:27:15.819
Apology? Why would I apologize?

1:27:15.903 --> 1:27:18.155
Because we've been chased
by the dead, sailing on a ship,

1:27:18.155 --> 1:27:20.365
raised from a bottle.
Where is your science in that?

1:27:20.407 --> 1:27:22.826
Fine, I will apologize.

1:27:23.535 --> 1:27:24.286
Go on, then.

1:27:24.495 --> 1:27:26.455
Well then, one could argue that
you owe me an apology.

1:27:26.455 --> 1:27:29.208
As my life has been threatened by
pirates and dead man.

1:27:29.249 --> 1:27:31.418
Which you now believe in,
sorry to say.

1:27:31.752 --> 1:27:33.003
Apology accepted.

1:27:35.130 --> 1:27:36.590
I am going to the lookout.

1:27:37.174 --> 1:27:38.884
I'm glad you see it my way!

1:27:48.435 --> 1:27:51.146
- Ready the guns.
- Aye. Ready the guns!

1:27:51.188 --> 1:27:53.273
These pirates are going
for the trident.

1:28:07.955 --> 1:28:10.082
Where did you get that from Missy?

1:28:10.749 --> 1:28:13.877
I know this book,
stolen from an Italian ship,

1:28:13.919 --> 1:28:16.088
- many years ago.
- Stolen?

1:28:16.463 --> 1:28:17.756
No, you're mistaken.

1:28:17.798 --> 1:28:19.633
There was a Ruby on the cover...

1:28:19.675 --> 1:28:21.718
I would not soon forget.

1:28:24.930 --> 1:28:26.849
This was given to me by my father.

1:28:26.890 --> 1:28:29.017
He was clearly a man of science.

1:28:31.019 --> 1:28:33.147
He was clearly a common thief.

1:28:34.565 --> 1:28:36.525
The memory of my father
will not be befouled...

1:28:36.567 --> 1:28:38.110
by the tongue of a pirate.

1:28:38.819 --> 1:28:40.654
This diary is my birth right.

1:28:41.029 --> 1:28:43.198
Left to me on the steps
of a children's home.

1:28:43.782 --> 1:28:45.534
Along with a name and nothing else.

1:28:45.826 --> 1:28:47.619
Oh, so you are an orphan?

1:28:48.662 --> 1:28:50.080
What be you called?

1:28:52.249 --> 1:28:54.501
Brightest star in the North
gave me my name.

1:29:01.300 --> 1:29:04.553
- That would be Carina?
- Carina Smyth.

1:29:06.430 --> 1:29:10.559
- So, you do know your stars?
- I'm a captain.

1:29:14.021 --> 1:29:16.857
I know which stars to follow home.

1:29:59.983 --> 1:30:01.318
Smyth?

1:30:02.319 --> 1:30:04.780
Smyth is quite an unusual name.

1:30:05.989 --> 1:30:09.535
Did we not once
know someone, old Smyth?

1:30:09.618 --> 1:30:10.911
Shut your trip.

1:30:11.036 --> 1:30:12.538
What was her name.

1:30:13.121 --> 1:30:14.915
It's right on the tip of mi tongue..

1:30:15.290 --> 1:30:17.084
Do you wanna loose that tongue?

1:30:17.125 --> 1:30:18.210
Margaret Smyth.

1:30:19.711 --> 1:30:21.839
Aye, so we making accord then?

1:30:22.256 --> 1:30:24.758
Or, Shall I tell you know who..

1:30:25.217 --> 1:30:27.344
What we both know it's the truth.

1:30:27.386 --> 1:30:29.888
We both take the secret to our grave.

1:30:29.930 --> 1:30:31.765
You mean, it is true?
I was bluffing.

1:30:31.807 --> 1:30:32.641
I am not!

1:30:32.683 --> 1:30:35.978
You kill me, you got nothing
to bow to the deadness.

1:30:36.436 --> 1:30:38.230
So you need me.

1:30:39.314 --> 1:30:44.069
I will have to frank Hector.
You are very, very ugly.

1:30:44.111 --> 1:30:48.448
So how could you produce
a fetching creature such as that?

1:30:48.866 --> 1:30:50.325
Margaret died.

1:30:52.244 --> 1:30:53.829
That worthless blaggerd ever could.

1:30:54.204 --> 1:30:57.791
I placed the infant in an orphanage,
never to see her again.

1:30:58.041 --> 1:31:00.836
I thought the ruby might afford her
some easy life..

1:31:00.878 --> 1:31:03.338
But I never imagined
she would take those scribblings..

1:31:03.589 --> 1:31:05.174
Make a life of her own.

1:31:06.467 --> 1:31:08.594
Life that's led her back to me.

1:31:11.346 --> 1:31:16.435
I would say this puts me in a
rather favorable position, Daddy.

1:31:16.477 --> 1:31:18.979
- Tell me what you want.
- I want mi compass.

1:31:19.855 --> 1:31:25.194
216 barrels of rum.
And a monkey.

1:31:25.944 --> 1:31:27.988
- You want Jack?
- Dinner.

1:31:27.988 --> 1:31:29.948
I want to eat him.
I want to eat that monkey.

1:31:30.574 --> 1:31:33.410
No deal Jack.
A clever young woman such as that,

1:31:33.452 --> 1:31:37.789
would never believe that a swine
like me could ever be her blood.

1:31:40.751 --> 1:31:43.045
And the Tridente will be mine.

1:31:53.806 --> 1:31:55.140
Redcoats.

1:31:56.433 --> 1:31:57.684
Redcoats!

1:32:00.604 --> 1:32:02.773
Prepare to fire!

1:32:02.815 --> 1:32:04.441
Prepare to fire.

1:32:11.448 --> 1:32:13.700
She comes starboard.

1:32:14.284 --> 1:32:16.245
We shall fight to the last.

1:32:16.453 --> 1:32:19.581
The pearl will not be
taken from me again..

1:32:24.378 --> 1:32:25.504
Sir.

1:32:30.384 --> 1:32:33.971
Only the British Empire
will hold the power of the sea.

1:33:08.255 --> 1:33:11.508
What ever happens,
stay your course.

1:33:37.326 --> 1:33:42.039
Jack Sparrow?

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.333
I've come with the butcher's bill.

1:33:48.796 --> 1:33:50.047
Where is he?

1:33:53.175 --> 1:33:57.429
Defend yourselves men! Till again!

1:33:59.264 --> 1:34:03.018
Hurry up man, what did you...
sharpen it with butter?

1:34:23.956 --> 1:34:25.499
There is nowhere to hide.

1:34:41.098 --> 1:34:43.851
Let's be brave, save the Pearl.

1:34:53.152 --> 1:34:54.528
This has to be it.

1:34:57.573 --> 1:35:00.200
- It has to be here.
- Sail that land.

1:35:00.284 --> 1:35:02.202
Oh mi Lord's eye.

1:35:02.452 --> 1:35:03.787
We're nearly there.

1:35:04.371 --> 1:35:06.331
It's here somewhere.

1:36:27.579 --> 1:36:29.665
Have you found what
you were looking for yet, miss?

1:36:29.665 --> 1:36:30.916
I'm trying!

1:36:35.295 --> 1:36:36.880
The stars will soon be gone.

1:37:07.077 --> 1:37:08.078
Carina!

1:37:08.495 --> 1:37:11.748
Henry! Look,
the island is there.

1:37:12.332 --> 1:37:13.709
You found it!

1:37:24.428 --> 1:37:25.512
The island.

1:37:31.310 --> 1:37:32.394
Land!

1:37:33.812 --> 1:37:35.189
Get to the..

1:37:51.497 --> 1:37:52.789
Carina!

1:38:08.889 --> 1:38:10.349
Carina!

1:38:13.393 --> 1:38:14.770
Henry!

1:38:28.325 --> 1:38:29.326
They took Henry!

1:38:29.493 --> 1:38:31.954
The trident be all
that can save him now.

1:38:32.162 --> 1:38:33.622
Then we have to find it.

1:38:53.559 --> 1:38:54.893
Where is it?

1:38:59.565 --> 1:39:00.983
It has to be here.

1:39:33.056 --> 1:39:34.349
Look at it Jack.

1:39:35.267 --> 1:39:37.603
It's most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

1:39:37.936 --> 1:39:40.230
This is what my father wanted to find.

1:39:40.272 --> 1:39:41.231
The rocks?

1:39:41.273 --> 1:39:44.359
No, no. Not rocks, stars.

1:39:44.735 --> 1:39:47.029
This is the map no man can read.

1:39:48.405 --> 1:39:52.451
This island is a perfect reflection
of the heavens.

1:39:59.958 --> 1:40:02.669
One star's missing, quickly.

1:40:03.796 --> 1:40:05.964
We have to find the
trident to save Henry.

1:40:06.215 --> 1:40:07.216
Hector.

1:40:07.257 --> 1:40:09.301
I think you should know
she's a horologist.

1:40:37.496 --> 1:40:38.789
Why is not it glowing?

1:40:40.457 --> 1:40:42.000
Finish it, Carina.

1:40:48.549 --> 1:40:49.800
The missing star.

1:40:51.593 --> 1:40:52.970
For my father.

1:40:54.429 --> 1:40:55.514
Aye..

1:40:56.974 --> 1:40:58.100
Do it for him.

1:42:29.399 --> 1:42:30.400
There.

1:42:31.276 --> 1:42:34.446
- Posiedon's tomb.
- This way.

1:42:37.741 --> 1:42:38.617
Capitan.

1:42:38.659 --> 1:42:40.452
You know the danger.
Don't do it!

1:42:40.661 --> 1:42:43.539
We have no choice.
Jack is on land going for the trident.

1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:45.165
Capitan, there must be another way.

1:42:45.249 --> 1:42:46.458
Once you possess the living,

1:42:46.542 --> 1:42:49.169
there is no coming back.
You will be trapped in his body.

1:42:49.211 --> 1:42:50.254
Forever.

1:42:50.295 --> 1:42:52.047
The Tridente will set me free.

1:42:55.092 --> 1:42:57.803
- Time to kill a sparrow.
- No!

1:43:11.817 --> 1:43:14.862
- Look Jack, there it is.
- The trident.

1:43:21.493 --> 1:43:22.953
Jack!

1:44:01.241 --> 1:44:03.494
You cut me,
you cut the boy Jack.

1:44:39.279 --> 1:44:41.198
- Henry!
- No.

1:45:12.855 --> 1:45:14.982
Hola, Sparrow.

1:45:16.108 --> 1:45:17.109
No.

1:45:28.829 --> 1:45:31.582
Sparrow, Sparrow.

1:45:32.875 --> 1:45:34.960
No.

1:45:39.089 --> 1:45:42.426
Henry, you've woken him up
Please.

1:45:42.676 --> 1:45:43.844
Henry wake up!

1:45:45.971 --> 1:45:47.389
Oh, piss off!

1:45:57.191 --> 1:45:59.026
Henry wakes up,
he is killing Jack.

1:46:10.037 --> 1:46:11.038
Henry!

1:46:11.622 --> 1:46:13.415
- Power of the sea.
- What?

1:46:14.082 --> 1:46:17.669
- The power of the sea.
- To release the power of the sea..

1:46:18.086 --> 1:46:19.379
All must divide.

1:46:25.844 --> 1:46:27.846
If the trident holds
all the power, then.

1:46:27.888 --> 1:46:29.515
Then every curse is held inside.

1:46:30.516 --> 1:46:32.434
As I told you before.

1:46:32.643 --> 1:46:35.646
Surrender to me now.
And I will let you.

1:46:36.605 --> 1:46:39.566
- Live.
- Do you want me to surrender?

1:46:41.693 --> 1:46:45.030
- Maybe.
- This is where the trail ends.

1:46:47.449 --> 1:46:48.575
No!

1:47:01.672 --> 1:47:02.673
Divide.

1:47:02.923 --> 1:47:04.007
Henry!

1:47:06.301 --> 1:47:07.553
Divide.

1:47:07.594 --> 1:47:08.137
Break.

1:47:08.178 --> 1:47:10.681
Break the trident and you'll
break off the curses of the sea.

1:47:10.764 --> 1:47:13.016
Adios, Sparrow.

1:47:58.729 --> 1:48:00.272
All curses have broken.

1:48:09.114 --> 1:48:10.407
Yes!

1:48:40.479 --> 1:48:43.816
- The Pearl! My Pearl!
- Climb.

1:48:44.066 --> 1:48:46.360
Move, fast!

1:48:49.822 --> 1:48:52.741
Hold it steady boys,
don't let it slip.

1:48:57.746 --> 1:48:59.289
Jack!

1:49:02.167 --> 1:49:03.627
Faster!

1:49:16.181 --> 1:49:18.559
Lift, anchor!

1:49:18.851 --> 1:49:20.894
Get the anchor up, quick!

1:49:20.936 --> 1:49:21.770
Stop, stop, bring it up.

1:49:21.770 --> 1:49:24.148
Bring it up!

1:49:41.582 --> 1:49:44.543
Capitan!

1:50:09.776 --> 1:50:11.320
Oh, crap!

1:50:32.633 --> 1:50:34.134
I've got ya.

1:50:55.989 --> 1:50:57.825
Who am I to you?

1:51:00.536 --> 1:51:02.079
Treasure.

1:51:12.756 --> 1:51:13.841
Hold on!

1:51:17.678 --> 1:51:18.804
Hector!

1:52:34.213 --> 1:52:35.839
Go to starboard!

1:53:01.698 --> 1:53:03.659
Pirate's life, Hector.

1:53:39.945 --> 1:53:40.988
You were right?

1:53:42.698 --> 1:53:43.782
I don't know.

1:53:44.408 --> 1:53:46.660
For a moment I had everything Henry.

1:53:48.912 --> 1:53:50.581
Now it's all gone again.

1:53:50.789 --> 1:53:53.333
It's not all gone, Smyth.

1:54:06.722 --> 1:54:11.226
Barbarossa...
My name is Barbarossa.

1:54:53.227 --> 1:54:56.230
- Maybe Jack was right.
- About what?

1:54:56.980 --> 1:54:58.774
You unstretchable itch.

1:55:02.444 --> 1:55:03.821
Why did you do that for?

1:55:03.904 --> 1:55:05.656
Just checking it's truly you.

1:55:05.906 --> 1:55:07.533
That you are not still cursed.

1:55:08.450 --> 1:55:10.869
- It's me.
- Then I was..

1:55:10.911 --> 1:55:13.288
- Wrong.
- Slightly an error.

1:55:13.747 --> 1:55:14.873
Although one.

1:55:21.421 --> 1:55:22.923
Apology accepted.

1:55:36.562 --> 1:55:38.021
The Dutchman.

1:56:13.474 --> 1:56:16.643
- Henry?
- Yes father.

1:56:25.486 --> 1:56:27.446
Oh, look at you son.

1:56:31.909 --> 1:56:33.202
How did you do it?

1:56:35.245 --> 1:56:37.998
- How did you break the curse?
- Let me tell you a tale.

1:56:38.707 --> 1:56:41.168
The tale of the greatest
treasure known to man.

1:56:41.251 --> 1:56:42.961
That's the tale I wanna hear.

1:57:41.979 --> 1:57:44.022
What a silly revolting sight.

1:57:44.022 --> 1:57:45.023
Make way!

1:57:45.315 --> 1:57:47.818
Captain Jack Sparrow on deck...

1:57:47.901 --> 1:57:48.902
Indeed.

1:57:54.074 --> 1:57:55.409
Welcome back, Captain.

1:57:55.450 --> 1:57:57.494
I thank you very much, coming through.

1:57:57.786 --> 1:58:00.414
- Captain!
- Thank you, I remember you.

1:58:00.956 --> 1:58:02.916
- Cheers, thank you.
- Oh good!

1:58:03.125 --> 1:58:04.126
Master Gibbs.

1:58:04.209 --> 1:58:06.003
The ship is yours Captain.

1:58:06.044 --> 1:58:07.045
Aye, thank you!

1:58:19.099 --> 1:58:20.184
Monkey.

1:58:27.441 --> 1:58:28.775
Thank you!

1:58:29.693 --> 1:58:31.778
What be aye heading captain?

1:58:31.904 --> 1:58:33.739
We should follow the stars,

1:58:33.780 --> 1:58:35.073
Master Gibbs.

1:58:35.449 --> 1:58:37.117
Aye.. aye, Captain!

1:58:43.123 --> 1:58:47.419
I have a rendezvous beyond my..
Beloved horizon.
