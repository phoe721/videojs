WEBVTT

02:06.080 --> 02:07.207
We're not clear yet.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.840
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.760
Forget the munitions, there's no time.
Just get everyone on the transports.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.082
Oh, no.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.287
We've caught them in the middle
of their evacuation.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.648
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.481
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.691
Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought.

02:41.840 --> 02:47.370
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.768
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.201
A single light fighter.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.041
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.281
<i>We've pulled crazier stunts than this.</i>

03:22.440 --> 03:26.125
Just for the record, Commander Dameron,
I'm with the droid on this one.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.169
<i>Thank you for your support, General.</i>

03:29.320 --> 03:30.480
Happy beeps.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.640
Attention.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.529
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

03:34.680 --> 03:37.684
<i>I have an urgent communiqu?for General Hugs.</i>

03:37.840 --> 03:39.205
Patch him through.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.046
This is General Hux of the First Order.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.523
The Republic is no more.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.923
Your fleet are Rebel scum and war criminals.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.566
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

03:50.720 --> 03:53.246
there will be no surrender.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.443
<i>Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.</i>

03:56.600 --> 03:59.570
This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.809
We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.768
<i>Okay. I'll hold.</i>

04:06.440 --> 04:07.441
Hello?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.326
<i>Hello? Yup. I'm still here.</i>

04:11.080 --> 04:12.810
Can he hear me?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.200
- <i>Hugs?</i>
- He can.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.603
<i>With an "H." Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.</i>

04:18.040 --> 04:21.089
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

04:21.280 --> 04:22.805
Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him,

04:23.240 --> 04:26.164
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

04:26.320 --> 04:28.607
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.524
...<i>about his mother.</i>

04:30.880 --> 04:32.400
Open fire!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.040
BB-8, punch it!

04:43.920 --> 04:45.320
He's going for the dreadnought.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.401
Ha!

04:47.000 --> 04:48.127
He's insane.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.249
<i>Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.</i>

05:06.520 --> 05:08.400
All right, taking out the cannons now.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.560
<i>Tallie, start your approach.</i>

05:09.640 --> 05:10.687
<i>Copy that.</i>

05:12.280 --> 05:15.250
<i>Captain Canady,
why aren't you blasting that puny ship?</i>

05:15.640 --> 05:18.211
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.725
We need to scramble our fighters

05:20.200 --> 05:21.930
five bloody minutes ago.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.286
He'll never penetrate our armor.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.249
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.408
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.000
<i>One cannon left.</i>

05:31.160 --> 05:32.491
<i>And here comes the parade.</i>

05:38.120 --> 05:39.121
<i>Yeah! Yeah, I see him!</i>

05:44.040 --> 05:46.440
No, no, no. Damn it!

05:46.520 --> 05:47.851
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.401
We gotta take out that last cannon
or our bombers are toast.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.880
<i>Work your magic, buddy.</i>

06:07.440 --> 06:08.965
Are the auto-cannons primed?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.121
Primed and ready, sir.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.486
What are we waiting for?

06:11.880 --> 06:12.927
Fire on the base!

06:17.520 --> 06:18.521
Punch it!

06:26.880 --> 06:29.008
<i>The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.</i>

06:30.000 --> 06:31.240
You did it, Poe.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.640
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.800
No, General...

06:35.880 --> 06:37.450
<i>We can do this. We have the chance</i>

06:37.600 --> 06:38.681
to take out a dreadnought.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.324
<i>These things are fleet killers.</i>

06:44.480 --> 06:45.480
<i>We can't let it get away.</i>

06:45.560 --> 06:46.766
Disengage now...

06:46.920 --> 06:49.730
<i>Commander. That is an or...</i>

06:55.480 --> 06:58.643
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.845
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.161
Nervous?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.325
Let's go, BB-8.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.600
It's now or never!

07:32.280 --> 07:34.408
<i>Yes!</i>

07:36.280 --> 07:38.040
All clear! Bring the bombs.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.121
Captain,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.569
Resistance bombers approaching.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.041
Of course they are.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.485
<i>Bombers, keep that tight formation.</i>

07:57.640 --> 07:59.688
<i>Fighters, protect the bombers.</i>

07:59.840 --> 08:02.447
<i>It's not every day we get a shot at
a dreadnought, so let's make this count.</i>

08:02.560 --> 08:03.607
Copy that, Blue Leader.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.649
<i>You get us there, we'll give it to them.</i>

08:05.800 --> 08:07.450
- <i>Copy. We're on it.</i>
- Fighters incoming.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.405
<i>Gunners, look alive.</i>

08:13.560 --> 08:14.680
<i>Snubfighters at two-ten!</i>

08:14.760 --> 08:15.840
- <i>They're coming in!</i>
- <i>Form up!</i>

08:15.920 --> 08:17.331
They're everywhere!

08:17.720 --> 08:19.800
- <i>Here they come.</i>
- <i>Incoming fighters. Form up.</i>

08:19.880 --> 08:21.240
<i>Vector in at attack speed.</i>

08:21.320 --> 08:23.050
- <i>Pull up!</i>
- <i>Flank right.</i>

08:24.280 --> 08:26.886
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!</i>

08:27.360 --> 08:29.442
Recharge the auto-cannons.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.610
Target their cruiser.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.322
I see it. Tallie, they've targeted the fleet

08:39.480 --> 08:41.130
<i>and begun the priming sequence.</i>

08:41.280 --> 08:42.327
<i>Copy that.</i>

08:42.480 --> 08:43.481
<i>We're almost there.</i>

08:44.960 --> 08:47.964
<i>Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.</i>

08:54.320 --> 08:56.004
<i>I've got a visual on the target.</i>

08:56.160 --> 08:58.606
<i>We're approaching the sweet spot.</i>

09:00.840 --> 09:02.205
<i>Bombs are armed.</i>

09:25.560 --> 09:28.166
- Auto-cannons aimed.
- Forty seconds to full charge.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.687
Destroy that last bomber!

09:35.800 --> 09:38.485
Paige, come in. We're over the target.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.807
<i>Why aren't your bay doors open?</i>

09:39.960 --> 09:42.247
<i>You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!</i>

09:51.560 --> 09:52.971
- Nix!
- <i>Paige!</i>

09:53.120 --> 09:54.963
Drop the payload now!

10:04.240 --> 10:05.321
Look out!

10:07.120 --> 10:08.360
No!

11:10.200 --> 11:11.361
<i>Bombs away!</i>

11:38.880 --> 11:41.000
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

12:15.600 --> 12:19.248
General, Supreme Leader Snoke
is making contact from his ship.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.801
Excellent.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.571
I'll take it in my chambers.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.760
<i>General Hux.</i>

12:28.840 --> 12:31.840
Ah, good. Supreme Lea...

12:35.680 --> 12:36.920
<i>My disappointment</i>

12:37.000 --> 12:41.528
<i>in your performance cannot be overstated.</i>

12:41.680 --> 12:43.842
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.208
We have them tied on the end of a string.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.367
Rey!

13:17.000 --> 13:18.400
Well done, pal.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.203
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.290
Finn! Finn, buddy.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.525
It's so good to see you.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.727
What? Let's...

13:37.920 --> 13:40.969
We need to get you dressed. Come on.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.360
You must have a thousand questions.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.806
Where's Rey?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.410
Master Skywalker?

15:12.360 --> 15:14.283
Master Skywalker?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.570
I'm from the Resistance.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.610
Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.044
Hello?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.851
Go away.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.131
Chewie, what are you doing here?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.245
He said you're coming back with us.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.401
How did you find me?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.244
Long story. We'll tell you on the <i>Falcon.</i>

16:18.440 --> 16:19.805
<i>Falcon?</i>

16:22.400 --> 16:23.811
Wait.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.043
Where's Han?

16:34.120 --> 16:37.966
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.329
The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.727
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.130
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

16:54.320 --> 16:57.642
in such a place of power?

16:57.800 --> 17:01.566
A cur's weakness, properly manipulated,

17:01.720 --> 17:05.441
can be a sharp tool.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.284
How's your wound?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.641
<i>It's nothing.</i>

17:12.400 --> 17:13.401
Hmm.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.721
The mighty Kylo Ren.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.290
When I found you,

17:22.080 --> 17:26.051
I saw what all masters live to see.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.091
Raw, untamed power.

17:30.240 --> 17:35.690
And beyond that, something truly special.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.966
The potential of your bloodline.

17:39.960 --> 17:44.329
A new Vader.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.566
Now I fear

17:54.240 --> 17:56.891
I was mistaken.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.646
<i>I've given everything I have to you.</i>

18:02.680 --> 18:04.011
<i>To the dark side.</i>

18:04.160 --> 18:07.084
Take that ridiculous thing off.

18:16.280 --> 18:20.046
Yes, there it is.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.880
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

18:24.960 --> 18:26.007
young Solo.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.804
I killed Han Solo.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.889
When the moment came, I didn't hesitate.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.600
And look at you,

18:32.680 --> 18:36.002
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.640
You were unbalanced,

18:38.840 --> 18:42.527
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

18:42.720 --> 18:43.960
You failed!

18:47.160 --> 18:48.571
Skywalker lives.

18:49.840 --> 18:54.482
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.529
And as long as it does,

18:56.680 --> 19:00.002
hope lives in the galaxy.

19:00.200 --> 19:05.445
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.689
Alas, you're no Vader.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.366
You're just a child

19:15.280 --> 19:17.487
in a mask.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.327
Prepare my ship.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.044
<i>There's no light left in Kylo Ren.</i>

20:00.000 --> 20:01.604
He's only getting stronger.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.521
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.688
We need your help.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.446
We need the Jedi Order back.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.207
We need Luke Skywalker.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.765
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.920
Did you hear a word I just said?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.001
You think what?

20:25.200 --> 20:29.808
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

20:30.840 --> 20:33.640
What did you think was going to happen here?

20:33.720 --> 20:34.760
You think that I came

20:34.840 --> 20:39.050
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.965
Go away.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.329
I'm not leaving without you!

21:51.280 --> 21:52.407
Careful!

22:28.520 --> 22:29.965
You're wasting your time.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.483
Who are you?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.447
I know this place.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.845
Built a thousand generations ago

24:04.600 --> 24:06.921
to keep these.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.291
The original Jedi texts.

24:12.600 --> 24:17.322
Just like me,
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.245
You've seen this place.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.289
You've seen this island.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.883
Only in dreams.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.889
Who are you?

24:30.280 --> 24:31.281
The Resistance sent me.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.646
They sent you?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.043
What's special about you?

24:36.880 --> 24:38.848
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.806
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.765
All right, that is pretty much nowhere.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.566
Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?

24:47.720 --> 24:48.767
The Resistance sent me.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.040
We need your help.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.201
The First Order's become unstoppable.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.011
Why are you here?

25:07.600 --> 25:11.002
Something inside me has always been there.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.323
But now it's awake.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.771
And I'm afraid.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.041
I don't know what it is

25:21.720 --> 25:23.563
or what to do with it.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.131
And I need help.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.002
You need a teacher.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.241
I can't teach you.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.087
Why not?

25:33.440 --> 25:35.408
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.326
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.967
I came to this island to die.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.683
It's time for the Jedi to end.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.726
Why?

25:49.920 --> 25:52.400
Leia sent me here with hope.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.405
If she was wrong, she deserves to know why.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.766
We all do.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.448
- You're demoted.
- What? Wait!

26:29.600 --> 26:31.842
- We took down a dreadnought.
- At what cost?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.730
You start an attack, you follow it through.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.484
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.689
There are things that you cannot solve

26:38.840 --> 26:41.764
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

26:41.920 --> 26:43.888
I need you to learn that.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.769
There were heroes on that mission.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.411
Dead heroes.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.571
No leaders.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.963
We're really nowhere.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.963
How's Rey gonna find us now?

27:02.480 --> 27:03.891
A cloaked binary beacon.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.565
To light her way home.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.128
All right, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

27:09.280 --> 27:11.089
We need to find a new base.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.287
One with enough power

27:12.400 --> 27:16.120
to get a distress signal
to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.804
Proximity alert!

27:20.080 --> 27:21.081
They found us.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.691
That's impossible.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.043
That's Snoke's ship.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.611
You gotta be kidding me.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.440
- Can we jump to lightspeed?
- We have enough

27:40.520 --> 27:41.851
fuel resources for just one jump.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.206
Well, then, do it. We gotta get out of here.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.691
Wait.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.371
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.641
That's impossible.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.161
Yes.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.640
And they've done it.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.760
So if we jump through lightspeed, they'll
just find us again and we'll be out of fuel.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.841
They've got us.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.764
Not yet, they don't.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.200
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.691
Permission granted.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.331
Admiral, swing us around!

28:08.480 --> 28:10.608
Full astern. Rotate shields!

28:10.760 --> 28:13.809
To your stations! Move, move, move!

28:27.680 --> 28:28.681
Follow my lead.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.126
<i>Green Squadron to launch position.</i>

28:36.280 --> 28:38.408
<i>Clear all launch traffic.</i>

28:42.000 --> 28:44.082
Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!

28:44.280 --> 28:48.205
<i>Technicians, lock down supplies
for launch conditions.</i>

29:19.040 --> 29:20.883
Move! Move!

29:37.640 --> 29:39.051
Poe, are you all right?

29:39.200 --> 29:41.407
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.971
We need to what?

29:43.120 --> 29:44.485
Full engines ahead.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.327
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.164
All craft, full engines!

29:50.320 --> 29:52.368
Concentrate rear shields.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.888
<i>Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of range.</i>

30:53.080 --> 30:54.605
<i>We can't cover you at this distance.</i>

30:54.760 --> 30:57.127
<i>Return to the fleet.</i>

30:58.960 --> 31:01.361
What is the point of all this

31:01.520 --> 31:04.922
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.083
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.049
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

31:09.200 --> 31:11.407
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.691
Well, keep up the barrage.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.320
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.601
Very good, sir.

31:18.760 --> 31:22.162
They won't last long burning fuel like this.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.527
It's just a matter of time.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.928
Move! Out of the way, everybody! Give room!

32:34.040 --> 32:36.361
Life signs are weak, but she's fighting.

34:08.680 --> 34:09.681
Artoo?

34:10.520 --> 34:12.204
Artoo!

34:14.000 --> 34:15.445
Yes.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.960
Yeah, I know.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.482
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.000
Old friend.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.688
I wish I could make you understand.

34:29.720 --> 34:31.723
But I'm not coming back.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.808
Nothing can make me change my mind.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.606
<i>Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.</i>

34:42.960 --> 34:45.531
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

34:45.680 --> 34:47.880
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...</i>

34:47.960 --> 34:49.246
That was a cheap move.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.051
<i>...but my ship has fallen under attack,</i>

34:51.200 --> 34:53.680
<i>and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

34:53.800 --> 34:55.768
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

34:55.920 --> 34:57.445
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

34:58.560 --> 34:59.766
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

35:11.160 --> 35:13.845
Tomorrow at dawn.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.891
Three lessons.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.646
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

35:19.320 --> 35:21.084
and why they need to end.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.571
<i>General Organa,</i>

35:33.560 --> 35:34.721
Leia,

35:34.880 --> 35:37.565
is unconscious but recovering.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.008
That's the only good news I have.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.920
Admiral Ackbar,
all our leadership, they're gone.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.003
Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.446
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

35:50.600 --> 35:54.730
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.001
To that end,

35:58.040 --> 36:01.806
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.570
Vice Admiral Holdo

36:05.000 --> 36:06.764
of the cruiser <i>Ninka.</i>

36:07.840 --> 36:09.285
Thank you, Commander.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.806
Four hundred of us

36:16.960 --> 36:18.485
on three ships.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.606
We're the very last of the Resistance.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.842
But we're not alone.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.207
In every corner of the galaxy,

36:29.360 --> 36:32.170
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

36:32.440 --> 36:34.204
and they put their hope in it.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.560
We are the spark

36:36.640 --> 36:40.201
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

36:41.240 --> 36:45.723
That spark, this Resistance, must survive.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.882
That is our mission.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.646
Now, to your stations.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.447
And may the Force be with us.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.286
That's Admiral Holdo?

37:04.280 --> 37:06.320
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

37:09.680 --> 37:10.966
Not what I expected.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.647
Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.645
With our current fuel consumption,
there's a very limited amount of time

37:17.800 --> 37:19.530
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.047
Very kind of you to make me aware.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.441
Let's get me those fuel projections.

37:23.600 --> 37:27.365
And we need to shake 'em before we can
find a new base, so, what's our plan?

37:27.520 --> 37:29.329
Our plan, captain?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.884
Not commander, right?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.202
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you

37:34.360 --> 37:35.725
for your dreadnought plan

37:36.440 --> 37:38.727
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

37:42.160 --> 37:43.480
"Captain." "Commander."

37:43.560 --> 37:44.687
You can call me whatever you like.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.690
I just wanna know what's going on.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.521
Of course you do.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.001
I understand.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.524
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.041
You're impulsive.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.047
Dangerous.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.004
And the last thing we need right now.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.965
So stick to your post and follow my orders.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.849
<i>Turbolink banks seven and eight
are offline due to maintenance.</i>

38:56.600 --> 38:57.886
What are you doing here?

38:58.040 --> 38:59.451
Hey. Hi.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.446
Uh, I was... You know, I was just...

39:02.600 --> 39:03.840
You're Finn!

39:04.800 --> 39:06.006
The Finn!

39:06.480 --> 39:08.244
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.170
I work behind pipes all day.

39:10.600 --> 39:14.127
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.486
Doing...

39:16.640 --> 39:17.767
Doing talking.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.451
I'm Rose.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.920
Breathe.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.128
- Okay.
- Yeah.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.762
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.764
May the Force be with you.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.047
Wow. You, too.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.444
Okay. But you are a hero.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.090
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

39:44.240 --> 39:45.731
When we heard about it, my sister Paige said,

39:45.880 --> 39:47.450
"Rose, that's a real hero."

39:48.080 --> 39:50.850
"Know right from wrong and don't run
away when it gets hard," she said.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.281
You know...

39:52.400 --> 39:54.120
Just this morning, I've had to stun

39:54.200 --> 39:56.487
three people trying to
jump ship in this escape pod.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.722
- What?
- They were running away.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.241
That's disgraceful.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.327
I know.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.321
Anyway, uh...

40:06.480 --> 40:08.164
Gotta get back to what I was doing, so...

40:08.320 --> 40:09.651
What were you doing?

40:10.240 --> 40:11.440
Uh, just...

40:11.520 --> 40:13.363
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.887
- No, it's routine checks.
- By boarding one

40:17.640 --> 40:19.051
with a packed bag.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.761
Okay.

40:20.920 --> 40:21.920
Listen, I'm...

40:35.720 --> 40:37.643
I can't move. I can't move.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.689
- I know.
- What happened?

40:39.840 --> 40:41.649
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.961
I was not deserting.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.362
- I told you that...
- My sister just died

40:45.520 --> 40:47.124
protecting the fleet.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.203
And you were running away.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.367
I'm sorry.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.082
But this fleet is doomed, and if my friend
comes back to it, she's doomed, too.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.527
I've gotta get this...

40:58.000 --> 40:59.889
I gotta get this beacon far away from here.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.405
Then she'll find me and be safe.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.129
You're a selfish traitor.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.290
Look, we can't outrun the First Order fleet.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.766
We can jump to lightspeed!

41:07.920 --> 41:08.921
Well, they can track us through lightspeed.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.560
They can track us through lightspeed?

41:10.640 --> 41:11.640
Yeah.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.800
They'd just show up thirty seconds later
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel,

41:13.880 --> 41:16.008
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.410
They can track us through lightspeed.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.721
Yes. And they could...

41:20.240 --> 41:21.241
I can't feel my teeth.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.211
What did you shoot me with?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.361
Active tracking.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.567
What now?

41:26.200 --> 41:27.281
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

41:27.440 --> 41:29.966
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.690
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.166
...from the lead ship.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.720
But we can't get to the tracker.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.920
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.331
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

41:38.480 --> 41:40.881
...has a dedicated power breaker.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.961
But... Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer?

41:47.240 --> 41:49.129
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.163
If I can get us there,
I can shut their tracker down.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.648
Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

41:55.800 --> 41:59.122
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.361
So we blow that one up?

42:00.520 --> 42:01.726
I like where your head's at, but no.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.610
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.720
But if we can...

42:04.800 --> 42:07.000
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

42:07.080 --> 42:08.286
without them realizing, then we can...

42:08.440 --> 42:10.522
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

42:10.680 --> 42:13.081
- About six minutes.
- Sneak on board.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.925
Disable the tracker.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.527
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.921
Hmm.

42:28.920 --> 42:29.921
How'd you two meet?

42:32.880 --> 42:33.881
Just luck.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.721
Yeah?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.240
Good luck?

42:38.680 --> 42:39.841
Not sure yet.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.685
Poe, we gotta do this.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.047
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.371
If I must be the sole voice of reason,

42:48.520 --> 42:50.523
Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.326
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.051
It's a "need-to-know" plan, and she doesn't.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.850
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right,

42:59.000 --> 43:00.365
you guys shut down that tracker.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.011
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.161
The question is,

43:03.320 --> 43:05.368
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

43:05.560 --> 43:06.561
We steal clearance codes.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.643
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.131
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.040
Nobody can.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.405
<i>Could I do it?</i>

43:20.560 --> 43:22.802
<i>Of course I could do it. But I can't do it.</i>

43:23.160 --> 43:24.840
<i>I'm a little tied down right now.</i>

43:24.920 --> 43:26.200
Oh!

43:26.280 --> 43:28.200
Maz? What is happening?

43:28.280 --> 43:31.640
<i>Union dispute. You do not want
to hear about it</i>.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.484
<i>But, lucky for you,</i>

43:33.640 --> 43:37.400
<i>there's exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!</i>

43:39.880 --> 43:41.530
<i>He's a master codebreaker,</i>

43:41.720 --> 43:44.720
<i>an ace pilot, a poet with a blaster.</i>

43:47.320 --> 43:48.321
Oh, my.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.762
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.400
<i>Oh, yes, he can.</i>

43:54.800 --> 43:58.771
<i>You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel</i>

43:58.920 --> 44:01.526
<i>rolling at a high stakes table</i>

44:01.880 --> 44:03.883
<i>in the casino on Canto Bight.</i>

44:04.040 --> 44:07.044
Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz...

44:07.200 --> 44:09.043
Is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

44:09.200 --> 44:11.885
<i>Sorry, kiddo. This is rarefied cracking.</i>

44:12.400 --> 44:13.765
<i>You wanna get on that Destroyer,</i>

44:13.880 --> 44:15.405
<i>I only know one option.</i>

44:15.920 --> 44:18.446
<i>Find the Master Codebreaker.</i>

45:46.760 --> 45:49.161
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.647
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

46:02.640 --> 46:03.721
Can you see my surroundings?

46:03.880 --> 46:05.405
You're gonna pay for what you did!

46:05.560 --> 46:06.846
I can't see yours.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.726
Just you.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.371
So, no.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.360
This is something else.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.321
Luke.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.444
What's that about?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.441
I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.

46:46.480 --> 46:47.640
Let's get started.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.291
Who were those things?

46:54.080 --> 46:55.411
Caretakers.

46:55.560 --> 46:56.687
Island natives.

46:56.840 --> 46:59.241
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.530
I don't think they like me.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.364
Can't imagine why.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.321
Master Skywalker,
we need you to bring the Jedi back

47:42.480 --> 47:45.290
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.920
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.401
What do you know about the Force?

47:50.920 --> 47:53.765
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

47:54.480 --> 47:55.920
and make things float.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.001
Impressive.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.128
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

47:59.640 --> 48:02.883
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.803
The Force is not a power you have.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.281
It's not about lifting rocks.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.483
It's the energy between all things,

48:17.640 --> 48:19.722
a tension, a balance,

48:19.880 --> 48:22.167
that binds the universe together.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.321
Okay.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.641
But what is it?

48:27.120 --> 48:28.326
Close your eyes.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.605
Breathe.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.321
Now,

48:34.760 --> 48:35.921
reach out.

48:42.680 --> 48:43.727
I feel something.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.840
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

48:44.920 --> 48:45.921
- That's the Force.
- Really?

48:46.080 --> 48:47.571
Wow, it must be really strong with you.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.721
I've never felt any...

48:48.880 --> 48:49.881
Ow!

48:52.720 --> 48:53.960
You meant reach out like...

48:56.600 --> 48:57.601
I'll try again.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.121
Breathe.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.249
Just breathe.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.642
Reach out with your feelings.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.206
What do you see?

49:21.280 --> 49:22.281
The island.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.247
<i>Life.</i>

49:26.600 --> 49:27.931
<i>Death and decay,</i>

49:29.480 --> 49:30.925
<i>that feeds new life.</i>

49:32.600 --> 49:33.647
<i>Warmth.</i>

49:34.760 --> 49:35.761
Cold.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.451
<i>Peace.</i>

49:41.040 --> 49:42.326
<i>Violence.</i>

49:43.360 --> 49:44.851
And between it all?

49:45.640 --> 49:46.641
Balance.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.640
An energy.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.285
A Force.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.524
And inside you?

49:57.680 --> 49:59.284
Inside me

50:00.440 --> 50:02.522
that same Force.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.810
And this is the lesson.

50:06.960 --> 50:10.089
That Force does not belong to the Jedi.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.125
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.448
Can you feel that?

50:18.200 --> 50:19.850
There's something else

50:21.880 --> 50:23.325
beneath the island.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.241
<i>A place.</i>

50:26.600 --> 50:27.761
A dark place.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.007
Balance.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.603
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.087
It's cold.

50:40.840 --> 50:41.921
It's calling me.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.287
Resist it, Rey.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.606
Rey?

50:49.200 --> 50:50.201
Rey!

50:59.040 --> 51:00.849
You went straight to the dark.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.770
That place was trying to show me something.

51:03.920 --> 51:05.763
It offered something you needed.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.681
And you didn't even try to stop yourself.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.444
But I didn't see you.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.084
Nothing from you.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.841
You've closed yourself off from the Force.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.765
Of course you have.

51:27.120 --> 51:30.203
I've seen this raw strength only once before,

51:30.720 --> 51:32.484
in Ben Solo.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.370
It didn't scare me enough then.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.085
It does now.

51:49.480 --> 51:50.481
What was that?

51:50.640 --> 51:51.846
Nothing, admiral.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.405
Passing debris.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.563
The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.291
We gotta hurry.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.560
Still can't reach the Resistance?

52:07.640 --> 52:09.324
Keep at it.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.170
If you get through, check their status.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.640
And ask about Finn.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.808
Why is the Force connecting us?

52:50.160 --> 52:51.161
You and I.

52:51.320 --> 52:52.731
Murderous snake.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.529
You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.006
Did he tell you what happened?

53:00.400 --> 53:02.562
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

53:02.720 --> 53:05.326
I know everything I need to know about you.

53:05.480 --> 53:07.005
You do?

53:09.560 --> 53:11.483
Ah, you do.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.683
You have that look in your eyes.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.649
From the forest.

53:19.320 --> 53:20.560
When you called me a monster.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.848
You are a monster.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.445
Yes, I am.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.761
Okay.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.202
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

53:57.360 --> 53:59.567
You know this town? Canto Bight?

53:59.720 --> 54:00.926
From stories.

54:01.080 --> 54:04.528
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

54:04.640 --> 54:05.641
Great.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.530
I told those two, I said,

54:28.680 --> 54:31.365
"This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here."

54:31.520 --> 54:34.126
But they just lit off toward the casino.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.685
Place your bets. Place your bets.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.644
All bets on the table right now, right now!

54:44.760 --> 54:45.807
Place your bets here.

54:59.440 --> 55:02.569
Aw, yes! This place is great!

55:03.200 --> 55:04.531
Okay.

55:06.840 --> 55:10.401
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.324
Let's find him and get out of here.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.520
Well played. The house wins.

55:15.800 --> 55:16.800
Where are your manners, more like?

55:16.880 --> 55:17.961
Come on!

55:41.720 --> 55:42.720
We've covered this whole casino.

55:42.800 --> 55:43.800
Zero red plom blooms.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.120
Where is this guy?

55:50.280 --> 55:51.964
Were those what I think they were?

55:59.160 --> 56:01.163
- What are those things?
- Fathiers.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.605
I've never seen a real one.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.931
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.330
Why do you hate it so much?

56:10.280 --> 56:11.566
Look closer.

56:16.760 --> 56:19.605
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

56:21.240 --> 56:24.528
The First Order stripped
our ore to finance their military

56:25.920 --> 56:28.048
then shelled us to test their weapons.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.162
They took everything we had.

56:37.480 --> 56:40.051
And who do you think these people are?

56:40.520 --> 56:43.968
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

56:44.640 --> 56:45.767
War.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.607
Selling weapons to the First Order.

56:50.600 --> 56:55.367
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.847
Red plom bloom!

57:12.080 --> 57:13.127
Red plom bloom!

57:13.320 --> 57:14.481
The Master Codebreaker!

57:20.840 --> 57:22.400
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.601
All right.

57:24.720 --> 57:29.169
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.320
You have the right to remain...

57:30.400 --> 57:32.520
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

57:32.600 --> 57:33.647
I'm on a roll.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.045
Lesson two.

59:19.240 --> 59:23.404
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.645
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

59:27.120 --> 59:29.168
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.641
Hypocrisy, hubris.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.761
That's not true.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.486
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

59:34.640 --> 59:36.529
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

59:36.920 --> 59:38.843
It was a Jedi Master who was responsible

59:39.000 --> 59:42.129
for the training and creation of Darth Vader.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.805
And a Jedi who saved him.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.050
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.407
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.206
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

59:51.560 --> 59:53.244
And I became a legend.

59:54.600 --> 59:56.762
For many years, there was balance

59:56.920 --> 59:58.331
and then I saw

59:58.600 --> 59:59.601
Ben.

1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:04.727
My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood.

1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:06.245
And in my hubris,

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:09.563
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

1:00:10.760 --> 1:00:14.082
Han was Han about it, but...

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:18.165
Leia

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.967
trusted me with her son.

1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:23.761
I took him,

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:26.564
and a dozen students,

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:29.125
and began a training temple.

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.283
By the time I realized

1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:36.609
I was no match for
the darkness rising in him,

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:38.770
it was too late.

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:41.445
What happened?

1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:46.371
<i>I went to confront him.</i>

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:50.324
<i>And he turned on me.</i>

1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:52.211
Ben, no!

1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:57.448
<i>He must have thought I was dead.</i>

1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:00.360
<i>When I came to,</i>

1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:04.124
<i>the temple was burning.</i>

1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:08.245
<i>He had vanished
with a handful of my students.</i>

1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:11.527
<i>And slaughtered the rest.</i>

1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:14.963
<i>Leia blamed Snoke,</i>

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:16.880
<i>but it was me.</i>

1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:19.011
<i>I failed.</i>

1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:25.569
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:28.403
Jedi Master.

1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:35.404
A legend.

1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:39.887
The galaxy may need a legend.

1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:48.770
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.330
And you didn't fail Kylo.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.170
Kylo failed you.

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:00.564
I won't.

1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:24.085
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:26.403
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:29.284
and its shields are down.

1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:31.329
The beginning of their end.

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:34.564
Destroy it.

1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:40.922
The last of our crew has been evacuated
and heading your way.

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:43.610
It's been an honor, admiral.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.649
<i>Godspeed, Rebels!</i>

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.047
Admiral,

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.728
fuel reserves at six hours.

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:56.568
Maintain our current course.

1:02:57.400 --> 1:02:59.084
Steady on.

1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:05.161
Finn,

1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:07.448
Rose, where are you guys?

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:13.961
Deal me in.

1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:18.080
Thanks.

1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:23.249
Finn, the fleet is running on fumes.

1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:26.880
Without a codebreaker
to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:29.684
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:32.846
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:36.251
Um, I can do it.

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:41.401
What?

1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:44.207
What?

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:46.161
What?

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:47.924
S-S-Sorry, I just

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:50.360
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:53.410
that you were saying really loudly

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:55.445
while I was trying to sleep.

1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.051
Codebreaker?

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.445
Thief?

1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:03.606
I can do it.

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.525
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:09.483
Yeah.

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:13.408
D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend.

1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:17.647
Me and the First Order codeage go way back.

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:20.607
And,

1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:24.209
if the price is right,

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:30.367
I could break you into
old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:34.049
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:38.966
Ha-tuk-ga.

1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:54.204
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:57.410
We gotta get out of here! This way!

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:58.640
Why you little...

1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:05.560
D-D-Did you do this?

1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:09.727
Hey, hands up!

1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:13.122
- Hands up!
- Yeah, man.

1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:30.844
What's your story, roundie?

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:32.640
They went this way!

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:39.403
- Lock down all the exits.
- Wait.

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:45.564
That smelled great.

1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:47.563
Those cops will be here any minute. What now?

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:54.930
Whoa! Ooh!

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:22.610
No, wait. Please, don't!

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.240
We're with the Resistance.

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.208
Roger that. Checking the stables now.

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:47.120
This way.

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:48.200
They must have come through here.

1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:55.361
Hyah!

1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:03.243
Go, go, go! Whoo!

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:10.680
Stop enjoying this! Stop enjoying this!

1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:19.567
<i>We've got them. They're not going anywhere.</i>

1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:26.681
Ahhh!

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:37.761
Huh?

1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:05.444
Move, move, move! Get out of the way!

1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:09.522
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:12.521
We need cover!

1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:24.686
Too much cover!

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:38.327
There it is!

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.843
- No!
- Come on!

1:08:58.080 --> 1:08:59.889
<i>Let the herd go. Stick with the perps.</i>

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:06.687
<i>Where'd they go?</i>

1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:11.001
I think we lost him!

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:12.810
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:14.001
Cliff!

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:25.200
We're trapped.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:29.366
It was worth it, though.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.286
To tear up that town,

1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:32.880
make 'em hurt.

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:43.481
Go.

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:49.760
Now it's worth it.

1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:01.041
<i>There they are.</i>

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:09.200
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.246
Ah.

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:16.924
N-N-Need a lift?

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:11.801
Luke.

1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:14.281
Leia.

1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.009
I'd rather not do this now.

1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:27.045
Yeah, me, too.

1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:31.004
Why did you hate your father?

1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:37.925
Do you have something,
a cowl or something you could put on?

1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:44.007
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:48.126
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:50.368
- I didn't hate him.
- Then why?

1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:51.761
Why what?

1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:56.725
Why what? Say it.

1:11:58.040 --> 1:11:59.371
Why did you...

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:02.128
Why did you kill him?

1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:03.766
I don't understand.

1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:04.921
No?

1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:06.684
Your parents threw you away like garbage.

1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:08.962
- They didn't!
- They did.

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:10.929
But you can't stop needing them.

1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:12.320
It's your greatest weakness.

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.241
Looking for them everywhere,

1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:15.606
in Han Solo,

1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:17.889
now in Skywalker.

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:23.089
Did he tell you what happened that night?

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:24.441
Yes.

1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:27.601
No.

1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:31.010
<i>He had sensed my power,</i>

1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:34.050
<i>as he senses yours.</i>

1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:37.004
<i>And he feared it.</i>

1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:55.126
Liar.

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:00.925
Let the past die.

1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:04.841
Kill it if you have to.

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:10.131
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.243
No! No!

1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:37.131
<i>Rey?</i>

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:08.885
<i>I should have felt trapped or panicked.</i>

1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:10.531
<i>But I didn't.</i>

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:14.920
<i>This didn't go on forever,</i>

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.162
<i>I knew it was leading somewhere.</i>

1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:20.400
<i>And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.</i>

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:23.971
<i>Rey.</i>

1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:34.687
Let me see them.

1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:37.163
My parents,

1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:39.402
please.

1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:16.602
I thought I'd find answers here.

1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:19.565
I was wrong.

1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:23.884
I'd never felt so alone.

1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:27.811
You're not alone.

1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:34.251
Neither are you.

1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:36.611
Rey?

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:46.084
It isn't too late.

1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:44.847
Stop!

1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:57.124
Is it true? Did you try to murder him?

1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:59.726
Leave this island now!

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.086
Stop.

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:03.361
Stop!

1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:09.001
Did you do it?

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:11.203
Did you create Kylo Ren?

1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:42.450
Tell me the truth.

1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:50.648
I saw darkness.

1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:54.363
<i>I'd sensed it building in him.</i>

1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:57.171
<i>I'd seen it in moments during his training.</i>

1:18:57.680 --> 1:18:59.523
<i>But then I looked inside,</i>

1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:02.725
<i>and it was beyond what I ever imagined.</i>

1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:10.122
<i>Snoke had already turned his heart.</i>

1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:14.560
<i>He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,</i>

1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:17.680
<i>and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.</i>

1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:19.640
<i>And for the briefest moment of pure instinct,</i>

1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:22.007
<i>I thought I could stop it.</i>

1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:26.560
<i>It passed like a fleeting shadow.</i>

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:29.329
<i>And I was left with shame,</i>

1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:32.608
<i>and with consequence.</i>

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:35.249
<i>And the last thing I saw</i>

1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:37.680
<i>were the eyes of a frightened boy</i>

1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:40.240
<i>whose master had failed him.</i>

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:42.921
Ben, no!

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.960
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:53.041
It wasn't.

1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:55.289
There's still conflict in him.

1:19:55.440 --> 1:19:58.091
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:00.004
This could be how we win.

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:03.164
This is not going to go the way you think.

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:04.920
It is.

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:07.885
Just now when we touched hands,

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:09.326
I saw his future.

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:11.970
As solid as I'm seeing you.

1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:15.967
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:17.287
Rey,

1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:19.842
don't do this.

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.324
Then he's our last hope.

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:19.845
Master Yoda.

1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:23.126
Young Skywalker.

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:26.845
I'm ending all of this.

1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:29.640
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:31.006
I'm gonna burn it down.

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:52.001
Hmm.

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:09.840
Ah, Skywalker.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:10.967
Missed you, have I.

1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:25.810
So it is time

1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:29.169
for the Jedi Order to end.

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:31.562
Time it is.

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:33.651
Hmm.

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:41.880
For you to look past
a pile of old books, hmm?

1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:43.724
The sacred Jedi texts.

1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:46.042
Oh. Read them, have you?

1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:48.205
- Well, I...
- Page-turners

1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:49.640
they were not.

1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:52.169
Yes, yes, yes.

1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:53.691
Wisdom they held,

1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.322
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey

1:22:57.480 --> 1:22:59.403
does not already possess.

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:04.244
Skywalker,

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:07.083
still looking to the horizon.

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:09.720
Never here, now, hmm?

1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:12.491
The need in front of your nose.

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:14.281
Hmm?

1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:17.810
I was weak.

1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:20.041
Unwise.

1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:22.771
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:25.926
Lose Rey, we must not.

1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:29.170
I can't be what she needs me to be.

1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:32.007
Heeded my words not, did you?

1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:34.966
Pass on what you have learned.

1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:37.248
Strength, mastery.

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:39.804
But weakness,

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:42.361
folly, failure also.

1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:45.649
Yes, failure most of all.

1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:48.770
The greatest teacher, failure is.

1:23:58.080 --> 1:23:59.081
Luke,

1:24:01.680 --> 1:24:05.082
we are what they grow beyond.

1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:10.050
That is the true burden of all masters.

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:25.248
Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks.

1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.084
I just hope we're in time.

1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:28.651
You can actually do this, right?

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:31.203
Yeah, about that...

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:38.408
Guys, I can do it.

1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:42.051
But there exists a pre-"do it"
conversation about price.

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:45.167
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:47.087
What you got deposit-wise?

1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:50.167
Are you kidding me? Look at us.

1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:53.004
Is that Haysian smelt?

1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:56.971
That's something.

1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:59.327
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:00.646
That should be enough.

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.086
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:06.682
But no something, n-n-no doing.

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:08.843
Okay, listen here, you've got...

1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:11.050
Do it.

1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:15.889
Now I can help.

1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:19.441
Give it back.

1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:21.920
What?

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.082
Give it back!

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:26.129
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:29.729
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:33.240
It's not your ship.

1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:36.087
He says I stole it.

1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:38.440
- Yeah, I got that.
- We stole it.

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.602
At least you're stealing from the bad guys

1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:44.241
and helping the good.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:46.368
Good guys, bad guys,

1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:48.568
made-up words.

1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:52.841
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:58.167
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:02.169
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:04.881
Oh...

1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:07.971
And the good.

1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:12.324
Finn, let me learn you something big.

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:15.848
It's all a machine, partner.

1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:20.365
Live free, don't join.

1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:34.801
That was the last of their support ships.

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.047
It's just their main cruiser now.

1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:38.091
And their fuel reserve?

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:39.970
By our calculation,

1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:41.611
critical.

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:46.840
She in there?

1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:47.921
The admiral's banned you from the bridge.

1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:49.485
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:51.483
- Holdo?
- You're not allowed in here.

1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:54.000
- Flyboy.
- Cut it, lady.

1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:55.800
We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship,

1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:57.610
and you've told us nothing!

1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:01.323
Tell us that we have a plan!

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:02.481
That there's hope!

1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:04.051
When I served under Leia,

1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:06.680
she would say, hope is like the sun.

1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:09.366
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:11.762
You'll never make it through the night.

1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:13.531
Yes.

1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:23.648
Are you fueling up the transports?

1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:30.446
You are.

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:32.400
All of them?

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:36.286
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:38.569
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:40.281
Coward!

1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:44.050
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:46.487
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:49.371
We don't stand a chance.
No, you are not just a coward,

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:51.045
you are a traitor.

1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:54.002
Get this man off my bridge.

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:03.120
<i>Finn, Holdo's loading
the crew in the shuttle.</i>

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:05.009
<i>She's going to abandon ship. Where are you?</i>

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:06.890
Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet.

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:08.201
We're so close.

1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.407
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:11.688
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:13.200
<i>We can shut the tracker down.</i>

1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:15.283
<i>Just buy us a little more time.</i>

1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:18.010
All right. Hurry.

1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:24.964
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.880
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:32.480
If you see Finn before I do,

1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:33.560
tell him...

1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:37.520
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.841
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

1:29:47.640 --> 1:29:49.961
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:51.770
Blip bloppity bloop,

1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:54.768
and slip right through.

1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:16.329
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:17.641
They are trying to save us.

1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:19.404
This is our best chance for escape.

1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:21.523
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:24.047
You have bet the survival of the Resistance

1:30:24.200 --> 1:30:26.965
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:28.281
There's no time now.

1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:30.480
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:31.560
Right away, admiral.

1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:32.760
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:34.800
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:36.689
I am relieving you of your command

1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:40.128
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.242
I hope you understand what you're doing.

1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:44.761
Yeah.

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.127
I'm going to the bridge.

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:48.283
If they move, stun them.

1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:11.645
- ...at least three cycles so far.
- Yes, sir. We are working on it.

1:31:18.840 --> 1:31:20.763
I will do my best, sir.

1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:32.166
Almost there.

1:31:41.320 --> 1:31:43.084
You don't have to do this.

1:31:43.640 --> 1:31:45.244
I feel the conflict in you.

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:47.130
It's tearing you apart.

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:50.527
Ben, when we touched hands,

1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:52.205
I saw your future.

1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:54.801
Just the shape of it, but solid and clear.

1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:57.602
You will not bow before Snoke.

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.210
You'll turn.

1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:06.090
I'll help you.

1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:08.165
I saw it.

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:09.970
I saw something, too.

1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:12.401
Because of what I saw,

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:15.006
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:17.529
You'll stand with me.

1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:19.201
Rey,

1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:22.721
I saw who your parents are.

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:41.924
Well done, my good and faithful apprentice.

1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:46.290
My faith in you is restored.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:49.642
Young Rey.

1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:53.330
Welcome.

1:32:58.680 --> 1:32:59.966
So this is it.

1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:02.009
The tracker's right behind this door.

1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:17.328
Haysian smelt.

1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:19.171
Best conductor.

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:29.285
And you're welcome.

1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:33.124
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:34.960
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:36.040
Course you do.

1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:37.920
<i>BB-8, tell me something good.</i>

1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:41.006
Poe, we're almost there.

1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:42.400
<i>Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.</i>

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:44.762
Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry.

1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.883
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:52.529
Commander... Captain Dameron,
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:53.841
Yeah, we spoke.

1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:57.522
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1:33:57.680 --> 1:33:59.523
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:13.281
Seal that door!

1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:17.120
We're running out of time.

1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:18.440
Come on, how's it going?

1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.170
Almost there.

1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:23.043
Threepio, where do you think you're going?

1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:25.203
It would be quite against my programming

1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:27.090
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:29.083
It is not correct protocol.

1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:32.360
Oh! Neither is this!

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:34.408
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:35.840
Now or never.

1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:40.811
Now.

1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:48.841
You're up.

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.840
- <i>You there, hands up!</i>
- <i>Watch 'em, watch 'em.</i>

1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:10.960
- <i>Drop your weapons, now!</i>
- <i>Hands up, Rebel scum.</i>

1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:12.724
<i>Get down! I said, down!</i>

1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:24.289
<i>FN-2187.</i>

1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:28.527
<i>So good to have you back.</i>

1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:30.487
They didn't make it.

1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:45.527
Leia.

1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.365
<i>Please board the transports</i>

1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:00.767
<i>according to your evacuation designation.</i>

1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:01.920
<i>All transports must be cleared...</i>

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.161
Okay, help me push him up, guys.

1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:05.051
That one's a troublemaker.

1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:06.920
I like him.

1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:08.687
Me, too.

1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:11.403
Now, time to board your transport.

1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:14.210
For the transports to escape,

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:18.170
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:24.330
Too many losses.

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.128
I can't take any more.

1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:29.766
Sure you can.

1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:33.208
You taught me how.

1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:36.920
May the Force be...

1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:40.690
You go on. I've said it enough.

1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:45.922
May the Force be with you always.

1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:53.920
<i>Cloaking device activated.</i>

1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.843
<i>We should be off their scopes.</i>

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.401
Let's hope this works.

1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:17.327
Come closer, child.

1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:22.646
So much strength.

1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.083
Darkness rises,

1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:30.001
and light to meet it.

1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:34.845
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:37.731
his equal in the light would rise.

1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:41.400
Skywalker...

1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:43.323
I assumed.

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:45.401
Wrongly.

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:50.449
Closer, I said.

1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:59.004
You underestimate Skywalker,

1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:00.847
and Ben Solo,

1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:02.806
and me.

1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:05.323
It will be your downfall.

1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:06.601
Oh...

1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:08.883
Have you seen something?

1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:12.290
A weakness in my apprentice.

1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:14.443
Is that why you came?

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:18.884
Young fool.

1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:22.767
It was I who bridged your minds.

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:26.568
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:29.849
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:35.245
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:40.131
And now,

1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:45.520
you will give me Skywalker.

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:49.166
Then I will kill you

1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:52.045
with the cruelest stroke.

1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:53.881
No.

1:38:54.520 --> 1:38:55.760
Yes.

1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:02.485
Give me

1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:05.530
everything.

1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:07.764
No! No!

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:09.287
No!

1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.010
No. No.

1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:19.366
No, no, no!

1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:25.361
Poe.

1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:32.081
What is that?

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:34.049
The mineral planet, Crait.

1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:36.567
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:38.969
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned,

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.600
but heavily armored with enough power

1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:44.241
to get a distress signal to our allies
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.521
Holdo knew the First Order
was tracking our big ship.

1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:50.525
They're not monitoring for little transports.

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:53.247
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed

1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:56.688
and hide till the First Order passes.

1:39:58.840 --> 1:39:59.921
That could work.

1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:03.528
She was more interested

1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:06.007
in protecting the light than she was

1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:09.040
seeming like a hero.

1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:22.286
Godspeed,

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.005
Rebels.

1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:55.085
Well done, Phasma.

1:40:56.200 --> 1:40:58.965
<i>Your ship and payment, as we agreed.</i>

1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:08.444
You lying snake.

1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:15.567
We got caught,

1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:18.322
I cut a d-d-deal.

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:22.171
Wait, cut a deal with what?

1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:23.924
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:26.886
We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough,

1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:29.361
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.722
He told us the truth.

1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:35.204
Will wonders never cease?

1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:36.401
No.

1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:37.841
Our weapons are ready?

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.365
Ready and aimed, sir.

1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:41.850
Fire at will.

1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:44.085
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:46.005
No!

1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:01.764
<i>Admiral, we're taking fire!</i>

1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:03.365
<i>- Do we turn around?</i>
- No, you're too far out.

1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:05.170
Full speed to planetfall.

1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:06.321
Full speed!

1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:14.160
Well, well,

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.006
I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise.

1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:21.171
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:23.727
the death he desires.

1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:25.600
After the Rebels are gone,

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:27.251
we will go to his planet

1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:31.246
and obliterate the entire island.

1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:39.451
Such spunk.

1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.247
Look here now.

1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:53.720
The entire Resistance on those transports...

1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:58.081
Soon they will all be gone.

1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:01.569
For you, all is lost.

1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:09.605
Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope.

1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:14.403
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.211
And because of that,

1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:26.731
you must die.

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:31.682
My worthy apprentice,

1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:35.606
son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:39.208
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:42.085
Where there was weakness, strength.

1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:44.484
Complete your training,

1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:49.203
and fulfill your destiny.

1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:00.124
I know what I have to do.

1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:03.280
Ben.

1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:07.167
You think you can turn him?

1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:09.529
Pathetic child.

1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:13.481
I cannot be betrayed,

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:15.728
I cannot be beaten.

1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:18.247
I see his mind,

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:21.480
I see his every intent.

1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:22.561
Yes.

1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:29.769
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:31.401
And now,

1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:34.089
foolish child,

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:36.208
he ignites it,

1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:40.401
and kills his true enemy!

1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:23.250
Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!

1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:24.811
I am, sir.

1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:29.005
You murdering bastard!

1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:31.802
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:35.085
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:37.450
It's just business.

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:41.206
You're wrong.

1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:45.927
Maybe.

1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:30.401
Ben!

1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:43.841
The fleet.

1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:45.001
Order them to stop firing.

1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:46.969
There's still time to save the fleet.

1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:56.761
Ben?

1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:00.928
It's time to let old things die.

1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:04.766
Snoke,

1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:06.206
Skywalker.

1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:09.605
The Sith,

1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:12.123
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:13.645
Let it all die.

1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:15.327
Rey.

1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:18.851
I want you to join me.

1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:23.371
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:24.931
Don't do this, Ben.

1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:27.161
Please don't go this way.

1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:30.802
No, no. You're still holding on! Let go!

1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:34.247
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:36.651
Or have you always known?

1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:40.810
And you've just hidden it away.

1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:44.365
You know the truth.

1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:46.645
Say it.

1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:51.000
Say it.

1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:54.525
They were nobody.

1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:56.330
They were filthy junk traders

1:48:56.480 --> 1:48:58.403
who sold you off for drinking money.

1:49:00.440 --> 1:49:03.569
They're dead in a paupers'
grave in the Jakku desert.

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:06.288
You have no place in this story.

1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:08.443
You come from nothing. You're nothing.

1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:14.046
But not to me.

1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:19.121
Join me.

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:33.647
Please.

1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:05.041
Sir,

1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:08.405
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:10.281
It's empty.

1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:12.249
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

1:50:12.720 --> 1:50:13.881
Pathetic.

1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.242
Keep your fire on the transports.

1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:46.811
<i>Execution by blaster is too good for them.</i>

1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:49.008
<i>Let's make this hurt.</i>

1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:55.721
Finn.

1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:01.964
<i>On my command.</i>

1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:08.046
She's running away.

1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:11.321
No, she isn't.

1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:28.210
- No!
- Fire on that cruiser!

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:43.041
<i>Execute.</i>

1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:28.241
Finn!

1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:31.290
There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!

1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:48.125
<i>Traitor!</i>

1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:50.801
<i>What?</i>

1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:15.121
Finn!

1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.284
<i>You are a bug in the system.</i>

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:37.846
Let's go, chrome dome.

1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:46.647
Come on!

1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:57.321
No!

1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:04.281
Hey.

1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:22.891
<i>You were always scum.</i>

1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:25.965
Rebel scum.

1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:41.682
Hey! Need a lift?

1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:21.568
What happened?

1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:23.844
The girl murdered Snoke.

1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:29.645
What happened?

1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:32.371
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:34.171
We know where she's going.

1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:36.890
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:38.805
Let's finish this.

1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:40.761
Finish this?

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.442
Who do you think you're talking to?

1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:46.406
You presume to command my army?

1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:50.528
Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!

1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:58.362
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:03.449
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:23.442
They're coming, shut the door.

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:32.884
Incoming!

1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:38.369
Go! Go! Move!

1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:41.288
Get that shield door down!

1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:58.440
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

1:56:58.520 --> 1:56:59.567
No! Don't shoot!

1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:00.721
Hold your fire!

1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:02.928
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:06.720
- Finn?
- Finn!

1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:08.930
Rose! You're not dead!

1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:10.320
Where's my droid?

1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:12.647
Buddy!

1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:15.326
I'm so glad to see you!

1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.882
Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:20.326
Is this all that's left?

1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:32.887
All right, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:34.440
Use whatever power we've got left

1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:36.648
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:38.484
Use my personal code.

1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:41.805
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:43.487
it's now or never.

1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:46.123
Rose, what do you got?

1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:50.207
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:53.805
Well, let's just pray that big-ass door

1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:56.200
holds long enough for us to get help.

1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:08.289
A battering ram cannon.

1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:10.090
A what now?

1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:11.931
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:13.844
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:16.330
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:19.369
BB-8, what do you got?

1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:23.369
BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics.

1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:26.640
This is the only way in or out.

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:35.001
Come on.

1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:37.240
We have allies.

1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:39.323
People believe in Leia.

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:41.570
They'll get our message, they'll come.

1:58:42.120 --> 1:58:44.362
But we have to buy time.

1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:48.005
We gotta take out that cannon.

1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:53.280
On me! On me!

1:58:54.480 --> 1:58:55.481
Move! Move!

1:58:55.800 --> 1:58:57.165
Go back! Gather your weapons!

1:58:57.320 --> 1:58:58.765
Get over here!

1:58:58.920 --> 1:58:59.921
Hold your fire!

1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:18.201
Salt.

1:59:18.360 --> 1:59:19.646
Ground forces, incoming.

1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:21.484
<i>Copy that. On our way.</i>

1:59:38.880 --> 1:59:40.041
Engage your mono-ski.

1:59:40.200 --> 1:59:41.770
<i>The green toggle.</i>

1:59:51.800 --> 1:59:52.961
All right, listen up.

1:59:53.160 --> 1:59:56.289
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

1:59:56.760 --> 1:59:58.091
What the hell?

1:59:58.240 --> 1:59:59.526
Just keep it tight

1:59:59.680 --> 2:00:02.650
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

2:00:22.520 --> 2:00:24.762
All right, ground forces, lay down some fire!

2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:39.689
Thirteen incoming light craft.

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:41.763
Shall we hold until we clear them?

2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:44.850
No. The Resistance is in that mine.

2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:46.521
Push through.

2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:52.885
Fighters, break off!

2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:05.850
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:23.328
<i>Rose, you got three right behind you!</i>

2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:32.201
I can't lose 'em!

2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:41.004
Whoo! Yeah!

2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:56.008
Whoo! I like this!

2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:07.683
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:09.245
All fighters!

2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:18.084
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:19.605
Draw them away from the speeders.

2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:27.050
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:28.804
Oh, they hate that ship!

2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:42.401
Chewie!

2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:14.761
There it is!

2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:21.087
That is a big gun.

2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:22.526
<i>Okay, it's heavily armored.</i>

2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:24.683
Our only shot is right down the throat.

2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:34.244
The cannon's opening. This is our chance.

2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:35.561
All firepower on those speeders.

2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:38.206
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:46.520
We're taking heavy losses.

2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:00.809
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:02.690
<i>All right, making my final approach.</i>

2:04:02.840 --> 2:04:04.251
<i>Target in sight, guns are hot.</i>

2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:05.640
No! Pull off!

2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:06.847
What?

2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:08.451
The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run!

2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:09.965
<i>All craft, pull away!</i>

2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:12.202
- No! I'm almost there!
- <i>Retreat, Finn!</i>

2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:13.600
That's an order!

2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:24.762
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:26.923
No! I won't let them win!

2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:30.928
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.525
<i>We have to retreat!</i>

2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:47.006
<i>The cannon is warming up now.</i>

2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:48.366
<i>Copy that. We see it.</i>

2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:50.284
<i>Preparing to fire.</i>

2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:33.923
Move! Go, go! Quick!

2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:35.764
Let's go, let's go!

2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:43.366
Rose?

2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:50.127
Rose?

2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:51.931
Rose?

2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:54.680
Why would you do that? Huh?

2:05:54.760 --> 2:05:56.649
I was almost there.

2:05:57.440 --> 2:05:58.931
Why would you stop me?

2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:01.808
I saved you,

2:06:02.840 --> 2:06:03.841
dummy.

2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:06.644
That's how we're gonna win.

2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:09.201
Not fighting what we hate,

2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:12.007
saving what we love.

2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:32.805
General Hux,

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:34.530
advance.

2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:36.564
No quarter.

2:06:37.960 --> 2:06:39.530
No prisoners.

2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:44.523
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

2:06:44.680 --> 2:06:46.762
but no response.

2:06:47.320 --> 2:06:49.084
They've heard us,

2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:51.568
but no one's coming.

2:06:55.920 --> 2:06:58.082
We fought till the end.

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:05.361
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:08.165
The spark

2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:11.571
is out.

2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:38.730
Luke.

2:07:47.160 --> 2:07:49.766
I know what you're gonna say.

2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:52.803
I changed my hair.

2:07:54.800 --> 2:07:56.484
It's nice that way.

2:07:58.320 --> 2:07:59.970
Leia,

2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:02.121
I'm sorry.

2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:04.163
I know.

2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:06.567
I know you are.

2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:09.328
I'm just glad you're here

2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:11.810
at the end.

2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:15.043
I came to face him, Leia.

2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:19.282
And I can't save him.

2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:22.928
I held out hope for so long,

2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:28.251
but I know my son is gone.

2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:31.851
No one's ever really gone.

2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:09.283
Master Luke.

2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:33.321
Stop!

2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:02.487
I want every gun we have to fire on that man.

2:10:07.640 --> 2:10:09.131
Do it.

2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:26.887
More!

2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:31.161
More!

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:47.370
That's enough.

2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:51.007
That's enough!

2:10:56.920 --> 2:10:58.570
Do you think you got him?

2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:01.723
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:04.087
we can finish this.

2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:05.367
Sir?

2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:33.171
Bring me down to him.

2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:36.360
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:37.441
Supreme Leader,

2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:39.400
don't get distracted, our goal...

2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:43.120
Right away, sir.

2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:45.765
Med pack!

2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:48.008
I need a med pack!

2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:50.248
She's hurt pretty bad.

2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:10.286
It's Kylo Ren.

2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:11.686
Luke's facing him alone.

2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:13.205
Well, we should help him. Let's go.

2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:15.084
No, wait. Wait.

2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:31.407
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:34.289
To save my soul?

2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:37.644
No.

2:12:56.520 --> 2:12:58.762
He's doing this for a reason.

2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:02.360
He's stalling so we can escape.

2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:03.440
Escape?

2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:04.600
He's one man against an army.

2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:06.205
We have to help him, we have to fight.

2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.560
No, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:10.244
that'll burn the First Order down.

2:13:11.360 --> 2:13:14.443
Skywalker's doing this so we can survive.

2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:16.080
There's gotta be a way out of this mine.

2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:17.321
Hell, how did he get in here?

2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:21.531
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:24.690
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:26.560
that the odds of finding an exit

2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:29.320
- are 15,428...
- Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:30.970
Shut up!

2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:33.890
- To one.
- Listen.

2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:38.802
My audio sensors no longer detect the...

2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:40.041
Exactly.

2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:48.651
Where'd the crystal critters go?

2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:55.321
Follow me.

2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:01.848
What are you looking at me for?

2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:03.491
Follow him.

2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:17.600
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:19.280
Keep scanning for life forms.

2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:30.605
This way.

2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:36.810
I see them! Chewie, there!

2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:53.370
No. No, no, no.

2:14:56.760 --> 2:14:57.761
No!

2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:11.843
Lifting rocks.

2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:54.446
I failed you, Ben.

2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:57.647
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are!

2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:00.882
The Resistance is dead.

2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:02.610
The war is over.

2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:04.803
And when I kill you,

2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:07.406
I will have killed the last Jedi.

2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:08.687
Amazing.

2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:13.006
Every word of what you just said was wrong.

2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:18.489
The Rebellion is reborn today.

2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:22.683
The war

2:16:22.840 --> 2:16:24.524
is just beginning.

2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:29.611
And I will not be the last Jedi.

2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:11.448
I'll destroy her,

2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:13.648
and you,

2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:15.450
and all of it.

2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:20.281
No.

2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:24.643
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:29.362
Just like your father.

2:18:18.800 --> 2:18:19.801
No.

2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:26.248
See you around, kid.

2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:41.331
No!

2:21:18.760 --> 2:21:20.800
C'ai!

2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:22.848
Such a friend.

2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:24.920
Chewie!

2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:28.004
It looks good.

2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:29.601
That was crazy, man.

2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:32.531
- Hi.
- Hi.

2:21:33.120 --> 2:21:34.167
I'm Poe.

2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:36.001
Rey.

2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:37.407
I know.

2:21:49.720 --> 2:21:51.720
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:53.040
Quite definitely possible.

2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:05.011
Luke is gone.

2:22:05.880 --> 2:22:07.291
I felt it.

2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:09.723
But it wasn't sadness or pain.

2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:13.321
It was peace and purpose.

2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:15.611
I felt it, too.

2:22:18.280 --> 2:22:21.204
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:28.371
We have everything we need.

2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:49.809
Luke Skywalker,

2:22:49.960 --> 2:22:51.769
Jedi Master.
