WEBVTT

02:59.946 --> 03:02.614
Kinda lonesome
back here.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.384
Yeah, little help.

03:05.386 --> 03:10.322
Okay, um, just,
i have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.759
Excuse me. Whoo!

03:13.761 --> 03:15.594
Ah, dopinder.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.663
Pool. Dead.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.399
Hmm, nice.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.568
Smells good, no?

03:22.570 --> 03:24.603
Not the daffodil daydream.
The girl.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.605
Ah, yes. Gita.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.540
Hmm.
She is quite lovely.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.876
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.945
But, um...

03:32.947 --> 03:36.715
Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin bandhu.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.452
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.622
Dopinder,
I'm starting to think

03:43.624 --> 03:45.557
there's a reason
I'm in this cab today.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.292
Yeah, sir,
you called for it,
remember?

03:47.294 --> 03:52.297
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

03:52.299 --> 03:53.699
When you find it,
the whole world

03:53.701 --> 03:54.967
tastes like daffodil daydream.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.403
So you gotta
hold onto love...

03:58.405 --> 03:59.705
...tight!
Ah.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.240
And never let go.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.708
Don't make
the same mistakes I did.

04:02.710 --> 04:02.710
Got it?
Yeah.

04:02.710 --> 04:08.247
Or else the whole world
tastes like mama June
after hot yoga.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.582
Sir, what does
miss mama June taste like?

04:10.584 --> 04:13.585
Like two hobos fucking
in a shoe filled with piss.
Okay, enough.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.521
I can go all day, dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

04:16.523 --> 04:18.624
Hmm, it's bad.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.460
Uh, why the fancy
red suit, Mr. pool?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.562
Oh, that's because
it's Christmas day, dopinder.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.998
And I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.699
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks...

04:27.701 --> 04:29.668
Six days and, oh...

04:29.670 --> 04:32.004
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.941
And what did he do
to you, Mr. pool?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.476
This shit...

04:38.611 --> 04:39.678
Boo!

05:00.533 --> 05:01.700
They won't disappoint.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.036
They'd better not.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.605
And what about
next month's shipment?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.340
There won't be one.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.908
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.611
That won't do.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.016
See, we've had
this small disruption

05:18.018 --> 05:19.484
to our supply chain...

05:23.089 --> 05:25.524
We'd appreciate your Patience.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.494
Okay.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.963
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.601
Pleasure doing
business with you.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.341
Fucking mutant.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.752
Oh, shit!

05:53.754 --> 05:55.554
I forgot my ammo bag.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.722
Shall we turn back?

05:56.724 --> 05:58.090
No, no time.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.791
Fuck it. I got this.

05:59.793 --> 06:03.095
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets,
or bust.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.429
Right here!

06:06.100 --> 06:08.800
That's, uh, $27.50.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.602
I... I never
carry a wallet
when I'm working.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.471
Ruins the lines
of my suit.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.605
Oh.
But, uh,

06:13.607 --> 06:14.940
how about
a crisp high five?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.074
Okay.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.744
Merry Christmas.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.880
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, pool!

06:41.468 --> 06:43.068
Wha... oh!

06:43.070 --> 06:46.505
Oh, hello. I know, right?

06:46.507 --> 06:48.473
Whose balls
did I have to fondle

06:48.475 --> 06:50.108
to get my very own movie?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.510
I can't tell you,

06:51.512 --> 06:53.979
but it does rhyme
with "polverine."

06:53.981 --> 06:53.981
And let me tell you,

06:53.981 --> 06:59.684
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

06:59.686 --> 07:03.855
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and, oh...

07:03.857 --> 07:06.658
Bad guys to kill.

07:11.931 --> 07:12.998
Maximum effort.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.109
Cock shot.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.148
Ha!

07:31.852 --> 07:33.985
Rich corinthian leather.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.190
I'm looking for Francis!

07:38.192 --> 07:39.991
Have you seen this man?

07:39.993 --> 07:42.060
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.901
Ow. Ow!

07:49.903 --> 07:51.002
Yanky, yanky!

08:22.503 --> 08:25.904
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.227
Shit.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.296
Did I leave the stove on?

09:08.814 --> 09:10.615
<i> Now, breaking news.</i>

09:10.617 --> 09:12.684
<i> A multi-car collision</i>
<i> turned shots fired</i>

09:12.686 --> 09:14.586
<i> on the crosstown expressway</i>
<i> this morning.</i>

09:14.588 --> 09:16.821
<i> Gridlock has kept</i>
<i> police from the scene.</i>

09:16.823 --> 09:19.291
<i> Residents are advised</i>
<i> to remain in their homes.</i>

09:19.293 --> 09:20.959
<i> The assailant</i>
<i> appears to be armed,</i>

09:20.961 --> 09:22.561
<i> dangerous, and wearing...</i>

09:22.563 --> 09:23.995
<i> A red suit.</i>
A red suit.

09:24.664 --> 09:25.897
Deadpool.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.568
Negasonic!
Come, we have mission.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.003
Colossus, wait up.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.340
I've given deadpool
every chance
to join us...

09:35.342 --> 09:37.709
But he'd rather
act like a child.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.078
A heavily-armed child.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.982
When will he grow up
and see benefits
of becoming x-man?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.117
Which benefits?
The matching unitards?

09:46.119 --> 09:48.019
The house that blows up
every few years?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.120
Please.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.023
House blowing up
builds character.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.959
You ate breakfast, yes?

09:53.961 --> 09:57.095
Breakfast is
most important
meal of day.

09:57.097 --> 10:01.366
Here, protein bar.
Good for bones.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.035
Deadpool may try
to break yours.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.845
Get out of the way!

10:31.130 --> 10:32.764
Hey! Whoo!

10:43.843 --> 10:45.343
Wait!

10:45.345 --> 10:47.646
You may be wondering,
"why the red suit?"

10:47.648 --> 10:49.681
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.150
This guy's got the right idea.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.685
He wore the brown pants.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.756
Fine!
I only have 12 bullets...

10:57.758 --> 10:59.324
So you're gonna
have to share!

10:59.326 --> 11:01.226
Let's count them down.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.813
Shit.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.418
Motherfucker!

11:27.787 --> 11:28.920
10! Shit!

11:29.388 --> 11:30.455
Nine. Fuck.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.057
Eight.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.124
Shit-fuck!

11:36.862 --> 11:38.096
Bad deadpool.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.800
Seven.
Good deadpool.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.747
Oh!

12:03.989 --> 12:06.458
Someone's not counting. Six.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.746
Oh!

12:33.052 --> 12:34.986
Four...

12:36.489 --> 12:37.889
Gotcha.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.825
Right up main street.

12:44.797 --> 12:45.864
Three, two!

12:45.866 --> 12:47.832
Stupid! Worth it.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.024
Ah!

13:14.126 --> 13:16.161
I'm touching myself tonight.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.363
Francis!

13:18.365 --> 13:19.831
Francis...

13:21.534 --> 13:23.968
What the shit-biscuit!

13:23.970 --> 13:25.804
Where you at,
Francis?

13:34.513 --> 13:35.814
You're not Francis.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.191
Really?
Rolling up the sleeves?

13:56.435 --> 13:58.002
<i> You're</i>
<i> probably thinking,</i>

13:58.004 --> 13:59.938
<i> "my boyfriend said</i>
<i> this was a superhero movie...</i>

13:59.940 --> 14:01.406
<i> "But that guy in the red suit</i>
<i> just turned</i>

14:01.408 --> 14:03.942
<i> "that other guy</i>
<i> into a fucking kabab!"</i>

14:03.944 --> 14:08.513
<i> Well, I may be super,</i>
<i> but I'm no hero.</i>

14:08.515 --> 14:10.882
<i> And yeah, technically,</i>
<i> this is a murder.</i>

14:10.884 --> 14:13.151
<i> But some of the best love</i>
<i> stories start with a murder.</i>

14:13.153 --> 14:16.221
<i> And that's exactly</i>
<i> what this is, a love story.</i>

14:16.223 --> 14:17.589
<i> And to tell it right...</i>

14:17.591 --> 14:19.991
<i> I gotta take you back</i>
<i> to long before</i>

14:19.993 --> 14:23.428
<i> I squeezed this ass</i>
<i> into red spandex.</i>

14:23.430 --> 14:26.164
Look, would it help
if I slow it down for you?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.533
I didn't order the pizza.

14:28.535 --> 14:32.470
Is this 7348 red ledge drive?
Are you Mr. merchant?

14:32.472 --> 14:35.974
Yeah, the Mr. merchant who
didn't order the fucking pie!

14:35.976 --> 14:37.141
Then who placed the call?

14:37.576 --> 14:39.110
I did!

14:41.280 --> 14:43.214
Pineapple and olive?

14:43.216 --> 14:46.184
Sweet and salty.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.352
The fuck are you?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.354
The fuck you doing
in my crib...

14:49.356 --> 14:50.521
Is it burnt crust?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.457
I... god,
i hope not. Um...

14:52.459 --> 14:54.392
Whoa... man, look,
if this is about
that poker game.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.661
I told Howie,
i told him that...

14:56.663 --> 15:00.665
Okay, uh, look,
just take whatever you want.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.901
Thanks.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.202
Sir, before you do
anything to him,

15:04.204 --> 15:05.937
do you mind
if I get a big tip?

15:05.939 --> 15:08.673
Uh, Jeremy, is it?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.308
Umm-hmm.
Wade. Wade Wilson.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.412
That is a no go
on the tiperoo, jer.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.281
I'm not here for him.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.016
I'm here for you.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.550
Oh.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.319
Okay, wow, dodged
a big-time bullet
on that one.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.022
Not out of the woods yet.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.357
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.359
They're jeans,
not a chandelier.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.595
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.497
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

15:32.499 --> 15:35.566
I will shoot your fucking cat!

15:35.568 --> 15:38.369
I don't really know
what that means.
I don't have a cat.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.238
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.444
Anyhoo, tell me something...

15:46.446 --> 15:50.281
What situation
isn't improved by pizza?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.583
Do you happen to know
a Meghan orflosky?

15:52.585 --> 15:54.319
Getting that right?
Orflosky?

15:54.321 --> 15:56.621
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.223
Because she knows you.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.459
Jeremy, I belong
to a group of guys

16:01.461 --> 16:03.594
who take a dime
to beat a fella down.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.163
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

16:05.165 --> 16:06.464
but lucky for her...

16:06.466 --> 16:08.499
I got a soft spot.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.002
But I'm a...
A stalker.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.470
Threats hurt, jer.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.140
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.243
So keep away
from Meghan.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.311
Cool?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.479
Yes, sir.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.981
Then we're done.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.083
Wait.
We are?

16:25.085 --> 16:27.352
Yeah. We're totally done.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.987
You should've
seen your face.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.421
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.556
Soft spot, remember?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.193
You even look in her
general direction again...

16:35.195 --> 16:36.694
And you will learn
in the worst of ways

16:36.696 --> 16:39.030
that I have
some hard spots too.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.333
That came out wrong.

16:43.369 --> 16:44.602
Or did it?

16:57.249 --> 16:58.750
Mmm... Meghan?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.454
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.190
No friggin' way.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.163
Should've brought
my roller blades.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.598
Show these kids
how it's done.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.201
Oh. And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.170
Hey, think you could
fuck up my step-dad?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.671
I give a guy
a pavement facial,

17:20.673 --> 17:21.739
it's because he's earned it.

17:22.408 --> 17:23.708
Hey, wait!

17:25.377 --> 17:26.644
You're my hero.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.313
No-no-no-no.
That I ain't!

17:30.816 --> 17:33.418
<i> Nope. Never will be.</i>

17:33.420 --> 17:35.420
Oh. Fuck you, Wade.

17:35.422 --> 17:39.090
<i> I'm just a bad guy who gets</i>
<i> paid to fuck up worse guys.</i>

17:40.325 --> 17:42.293
<i> Welcome to sister Margaret's.</i>

17:42.295 --> 17:45.263
<i> It's like a job fair</i>
<i> for mercenaries.</i>

17:45.265 --> 17:47.198
<i> Think of us as really</i>
<i> fucked up tooth fairies...</i>

17:47.200 --> 17:49.767
<i> Except we knock out the teeth</i>
<i> and take the cash.</i>

17:49.769 --> 17:52.837
<i> You'd best hope we never see</i>
<i> your name on a gold card.</i>

17:52.839 --> 17:55.206
Buck! Liefeld...

17:55.208 --> 17:56.474
Hey, Wade!

17:56.476 --> 17:57.708
Wade Wilson,
patron Saint
of the pitiful.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.577
What can I do for you?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.212
I'd love a blow job.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.413
Oh, god, me too.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.549
The drink, moose knuckle.
But first...

18:06.218 --> 18:08.252
Hey, and I ain't taking
any babysitting money,
all right?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.821
Make sure
that gets back to Ms...

18:09.823 --> 18:11.122
Orlovsky.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.190
Yeah, her.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.624
You sure?
Hmm.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.194
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.162
I bet you let
the kid off easy, too.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.131
Oh, he's not a bad kid, weas.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.365
Just a little light stalking.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.101
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.735
I was traveling
to exotic places...

18:24.737 --> 18:27.505
Baghdad, mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

18:27.507 --> 18:29.407
meeting new and exciting
people. And then, uh...

18:29.409 --> 18:31.609
Killing them. Yeah,
I've seen your instagram.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.145
So what was
special forces doing
in Jacksonville, anyway?

18:34.147 --> 18:35.646
That's classified.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.882
They have
a wonderful tgi Fridays.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.384
All right,
Kahlua, baileys and...

18:40.386 --> 18:41.652
Whipped cream.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.288
I give you a blow job.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.656
Why do you
make me make that?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.525
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

18:47.527 --> 18:49.127
Take that over
to buck please,

18:49.129 --> 18:50.895
and tell him
it's from boothe.
Little foreplay.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.364
Remind me what good
will come of this?

18:53.366 --> 18:55.433
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.734
Boothe!
Oh!

18:56.736 --> 18:58.136
Easy, man.
Hold up! Hold up!

18:58.138 --> 18:59.203
What you want?

19:01.807 --> 19:04.609
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.777
Come here,
you fat fuck!

19:06.779 --> 19:08.479
That's a new stool.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.685
Stay the fuck down.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.157
Whoa! Took his ass out!

19:19.159 --> 19:20.825
All right, move.
Move, move, move.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.193
Buck, go rest.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.695
Boothe got hit
then went down.

19:28.467 --> 19:31.202
Yeah, he's still breathing.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.373
Nobody wins today.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.175
Nice try, Wade.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.310
You got me.
I picked boothe
in the dead pool.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.678
Who did you pick?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.880
Yeah, Wade,
about that, um...

19:42.882 --> 19:44.415
No.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.350
You did not bet
on me to die.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.322
You bet on me to die. Wow!

19:51.324 --> 19:53.191
Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.426
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.562
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.565
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.866
I never win anything.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.967
Whatever.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.702
Soldiers of fortune,
drinks on me!

20:07.207 --> 20:08.973
Domestic, nothing imported.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.377
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

20:13.379 --> 20:16.948
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

20:17.482 --> 20:20.351
Uh... tight.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.255
Vanessa.
Wade.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.457
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

20:27.693 --> 20:28.960
I'd hit that.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.230
Buck, you best
apologize before...

20:32.232 --> 20:34.632
Yeah, that.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.400
Say the magic words,
fat Gandalf.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.236
I'm sorry.
Breathe through the nose.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.504
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

20:40.506 --> 20:42.506
Let go. Okay.
Hey, oh, oh, oh...

20:42.508 --> 20:43.608
Hakuna his tatas.
He's sorry.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.942
I'm working on it.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.578
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.981
Hey. Hands off
the merchandise.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.984
Merchandise? Huh...

20:52.986 --> 20:55.586
So you, uh...

20:55.588 --> 20:56.954
Bump fuzzies for money?

20:56.956 --> 20:59.023
Yep.
Rough childhood?

20:59.025 --> 21:00.291
Rougher than yours.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.460
Daddy left before
i was born.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.961
Daddy left before
i was conceived.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.831
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.332
Where else do you
put one out?

21:08.334 --> 21:09.600
I was molested.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.402
Me too. Uncle.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.871
Uncles. They took turns.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.406
I watched my own
birthday party

21:15.408 --> 21:16.607
through the keyhole
of a locked closet...

21:16.609 --> 21:18.009
Which also happens to be my...

21:18.011 --> 21:20.878
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.481
You had a dishwasher.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.582
I didn't even know sleep.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.517
It was pretty much
24/7 ball gags,

21:26.519 --> 21:27.985
brownie mix and clown porn.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.357
Who would do such a thing?

21:34.826 --> 21:38.462
Hopefully you, later tonight?

21:41.066 --> 21:46.070
Hey, what can I get for,
uh, $275 and a...

21:47.372 --> 21:48.973
A yogurtland rewards card?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.742
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.912
And a low-fat dessert.

22:01.853 --> 22:04.355
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

22:05.524 --> 22:07.658
It's time to put
balls in holes.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.328
You said whatever I want.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.330
I get it.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.831
You love skee ball.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.100
Apparently more than
you love vagina.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.569
That's a tough call.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.838
I just wanna get to
know the real you, you know.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.840
Not the short-shorted,
two-dimensional

22:22.842 --> 22:24.809
sex object
peddled by Hollywood.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.876
Balls in holes.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.012
Balls in holes.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.647
Prepare to lose tragically.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.781
Bring it, big man.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.849
Okay.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.486
Uh-oh.

22:35.887 --> 22:36.954
Uh-oh.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.657
The limited edition

22:39.659 --> 22:42.927
voltron: Defender of
the universe ring, <i> por favor.</i>

22:42.929 --> 22:46.497
Okay. Here we go.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.632
Had my eye on
this sucker for a while.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.568
And I will take
the pencil eraser.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.969
Okay.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.872
You are now the protector
of the planet arus.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.874
And you can erase stuff...

22:56.876 --> 22:58.642
Written in pencil.

22:58.644 --> 23:00.010
M'lady?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.479
Well, I hate to
break it to you...

23:01.481 --> 23:03.748
But your 48 minutes
are up.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.650
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

23:06.652 --> 23:09.086
Fyi, five mini lion-bots
come together

23:09.088 --> 23:11.522
to form one super-bot, so...

23:11.524 --> 23:14.625
Five mini lion-bots?
Three minutes.

23:14.627 --> 23:14.627
Deal.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.962
What do we do
with the remaining
two minutes, 37 seconds?

23:18.764 --> 23:19.830
Cuddle?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.836
How long can you
keep this up?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.171
All year?

23:37.649 --> 23:39.583
Happy Valentine's day.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.793
Happy Chinese new year.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.127
Year of the dog.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.001
Relax.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.170
And happy
international women's day.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.877
No. No. No.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.481
Happy lent.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.619
Ow, ow.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.887
Wade?
Sorry.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.489
Happy Halloween.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.623
Happy Halloween.

24:29.167 --> 24:31.035
Happy Thanksgiving.

24:32.971 --> 24:33.237
I love you.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.044
If your left leg
is Thanksgiving...

24:40.046 --> 24:41.846
And your right leg
is Christmas...

24:43.048 --> 24:44.715
Can I visit you
between the holidays?

24:45.517 --> 24:46.617
Oh!

24:46.619 --> 24:48.519
That sweater is terrible.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.055
But red looks good on you.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.490
Red's your color.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.024
Brings out the bloodshot
in your eyes.

24:54.926 --> 24:56.026
Listen,
I've been thinking...

24:56.028 --> 24:57.862
Really?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.930
...about why we're
so good together.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.866
Why's that?

25:01.868 --> 25:05.870
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Big time.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.805
Hmm.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.540
And, uh, we're like
two Jigsaw pieces,

25:09.542 --> 25:11.141
you know,
the weird curvy edges...

25:11.143 --> 25:13.611
You put them together
and you can see
the picture on top.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.546
Right.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.781
Wade...

25:17.783 --> 25:20.217
There's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.887
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

25:24.956 --> 25:26.090
Will you, uh...

25:27.192 --> 25:29.159
Stick it in my...
Marry me?

25:30.896 --> 25:33.163
Uh... jinx?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.032
Huh.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.200
Where were you
hiding that?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.235
Nowhere.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.037
They say one month's salary.
So, uh...

25:40.039 --> 25:41.071
You mean?

25:41.073 --> 25:42.139
I do.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.207
That's my line.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.046
I love you, Wade Wilson.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.548
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

25:50.550 --> 25:51.982
Yes!
Whoo!

25:52.717 --> 25:53.851
Yes!

25:55.922 --> 25:57.788
I feel just like
a little girl.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.062
What if I just held on
and never let go?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.798
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.134
Oh, <i> star wars</i> jokes.

26:10.669 --> 26:11.902
<i> Empire.</i>

26:13.204 --> 26:14.672
Jesus Christ.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.674
It's like I made you
in a computer.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.310
Mmm.

26:20.812 --> 26:21.879
Hey.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.281
Perfect.

26:28.019 --> 26:29.687
Let's see.
All right, wee break.

26:29.689 --> 26:30.955
Shake it, yeah.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.729
<i> Here's the thing.</i>

26:38.731 --> 26:40.698
<i> Life is an endless series</i>
<i> of train-wrecks...</i>

26:40.700 --> 26:45.102
<i> With only brief,</i>
<i> commercial-like</i>
<i> breaks of happiness.</i>

26:45.104 --> 26:47.905
<i> This had been the ultimate</i>
<i> commercial break.</i>

26:50.241 --> 26:51.742
<i> Which meant</i>
<i> it was time to return</i>

26:51.744 --> 26:53.644
<i> to our regularly</i>
<i> scheduled program.</i>

26:53.646 --> 26:55.379
What the...

26:55.381 --> 26:56.714
Oh, my god. Wade?

27:02.887 --> 27:04.722
You're clowning.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.323
You're not clowning?

27:06.325 --> 27:06.325
I sense clowns.

27:06.325 --> 27:11.228
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.131
There are certainly options
we can look into.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.000
New drugs are being
developed every day.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.072
So what do we do?

27:22.074 --> 27:25.676
Surely there is
something we can do.

27:25.678 --> 27:28.212
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer...

27:28.214 --> 27:30.814
And there were all these
new experimental drugs
from Germany.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.317
<i> Vanessa's already</i>
<i> working on plan a, b,</i>

27:33.319 --> 27:35.319
<i> all the way through z.</i>

27:35.321 --> 27:39.690
<i> Me? I'm memorizing</i>
<i> the details of her face.</i>

27:39.692 --> 27:42.059
<i> Like it's the first time</i>
<i> I'm seeing it.</i>

27:42.061 --> 27:43.193
<i> Or the last.</i>

27:43.195 --> 27:44.862
Mr. Wilson...

27:44.864 --> 27:46.697
Mr. Wilson?

27:46.699 --> 27:49.967
Take your time
to process this.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.969
<i> It's important not to</i>
<i> do anything rash.</i>

28:03.349 --> 28:06.116
Now, if I were
a 200-pound sack

28:06.118 --> 28:08.786
of assholes named Francis,
where would I hide?

28:12.457 --> 28:13.724
Oh.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.080
A hush falls
over the crowd

28:36.082 --> 28:38.382
as rookie sensation
Wade w. Wilson...

28:38.384 --> 28:42.019
Out of Regina, saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.422
His form looks good.

28:46.257 --> 28:47.424
Oh!

28:47.426 --> 28:51.962
And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.264
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

28:54.266 --> 28:56.734
Is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

28:57.502 --> 28:59.403
Oh! Giving him the business.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.739
Incoming!

29:01.741 --> 29:05.409
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

29:10.849 --> 29:12.850
Looking good, Francis.
Well rested.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.018
Like you've been pitching,
not catching.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.054
Ringing any bells? No?

29:21.993 --> 29:23.227
How about now?

29:27.166 --> 29:29.366
Wade fucking Wilson.

29:31.903 --> 29:31.904
Well,
hello, gorgeous.

29:31.904 --> 29:36.206
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive shar-pei.

29:36.208 --> 29:39.409
Yeah. And whose fault
is that, huh, Francis?

29:39.411 --> 29:41.445
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butterface.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.280
Please,
you should thank me.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.915
Apparently,
i made you immortal.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.450
I'm actually
quite jealous.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.952
Yeah, but this ain't
a life worth living,
is it?

29:50.922 --> 29:52.556
Now, I'm about
to do to you

29:52.558 --> 29:55.092
what limp bizkit
did to music
in the late 90s.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.228
Dad?

30:01.566 --> 30:04.334
<i> I think we can all agree</i>
<i>that shit just went sideways</i>

30:04.336 --> 30:06.270
<i> in the most colossal way.</i>

30:07.238 --> 30:09.807
<i> Well, maybe not the most.</i>

30:09.809 --> 30:13.510
Uh... this is
my most prized possession.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.179
Wham?

30:15.181 --> 30:17.447
No, no, no. Wham!

30:17.449 --> 30:21.051
<i> Make it big</i> is the album
that George and Andy
earned the exclamation point.

30:22.053 --> 30:23.587
So, am I supposed
to just smile

30:23.589 --> 30:25.055
and wave you out the door?

30:25.057 --> 30:26.456
Think of it like
spring cleaning.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.991
Only if spring
was death.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.360
God, if I had a nickel
for every time

30:30.362 --> 30:32.963
I spanked it to
Bernadette Peters.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.199
Sounds like you do.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.134
Bernadette is not
going anywhere,

30:37.136 --> 30:39.136
because you're not
going anywhere.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.437
Drink.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.839
You're right.
Cancer is only
in my liver,

30:41.841 --> 30:43.140
lungs, prostate, and brain.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.374
All things I can
live without.

30:45.476 --> 30:46.577
Ha.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.612
You belong here
at home.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.247
Surrounded by
your voltron

30:50.249 --> 30:52.382
and your Bernadette,
and your me.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.221
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.024
Like, a yakov-smirnoff-
opening-for-the

31:01.026 --> 31:03.894
spin-doctors- at-the-
Iowa-state-fair shit-show.

31:05.897 --> 31:10.434
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

31:11.636 --> 31:13.437
I want you to remember me.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.874
Not the ghost
of Christmas me.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.109
Well, I wanna remember us.

31:19.111 --> 31:19.111
I swear to god, I will
find you in the next life...

31:19.111 --> 31:23.981
And I'm gonna boom-box
<i> careless whisper</i>
outside your window.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.382
Wham!

31:28.653 --> 31:31.922
No one is boom-boxing shit.
Okay?

31:34.325 --> 31:35.926
We can fight this.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.999
Besides, I just
realized something.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.334
You win.
Your life is officially

31:44.336 --> 31:47.137
way more fucked up
than mine.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.476
I love you.

32:04.155 --> 32:05.355
Wade.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.992
Weas.

32:08.994 --> 32:11.295
You look like you need
a blow job and a shower.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.430
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.198
How about three shots
of patron?

32:15.200 --> 32:19.036
Or how about
<i> triticum aestivum,</i>
wheatgrass.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.370
Excellent for
the immune system.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.472
Jesus Christ.
You sound like Vanessa.

32:22.474 --> 32:22.474
Here, check it out.

32:22.474 --> 32:27.244
She's sending away
for all these colorful
clinic brochures.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.446
I'm sure they're
all fda approved.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.449
Chechnya. Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

32:32.451 --> 32:35.585
You got China
and central Mexico.

32:35.587 --> 32:38.055
You know how they
say "cancer" in Spanish?

32:38.057 --> 32:39.589
No.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.325
<i> El cancer.</i>
Oh.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.593
I could have
guessed that.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.162
Look how happy
you look here.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.730
Mind if I keep this?
Put it up,

32:46.732 --> 32:49.633
so I can remember
when you looked alive.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.635
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.438
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.340
I got it, weas. Thanks.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.742
Oh.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.445
And, uh, that guy over there
came in looking for you.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.381
Real grim reaper type.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.416
I don't know.
Might further the plot.

33:10.421 --> 33:11.521
Boothe.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.689
Wade.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.429
Mr. Wilson.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.630
How can I help you?

33:20.632 --> 33:23.400
Besides luring children
into a panel Van.

33:23.402 --> 33:27.170
I understand you've
recently been diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.338
Stalker alert.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.241
It's my job.
Recruitment.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.678
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.147
But you're a fighter.
Special forces.

33:37.149 --> 33:40.050
41 confirmed kills.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.418
One every seven weeks.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.454
Same rate most folks
get a haircut. Hmm...

33:44.456 --> 33:45.722
It's to wash
the taste out.

33:45.724 --> 33:49.292
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.328
And now you
spend your days

33:51.330 --> 33:53.330
sticking up for
the little people...

33:53.332 --> 33:55.332
People change.
What do you want?

33:55.334 --> 33:58.468
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

34:00.338 --> 34:04.574
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

34:04.576 --> 34:08.745
And what's more,
give you abilities
most men only dream of?

34:12.417 --> 34:14.317
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

34:14.319 --> 34:16.486
but not a good one,
like slap chop.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.221
More shake weight-y.

34:18.223 --> 34:21.291
The world needs
extraordinary soldiers.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.427
We won't just
make you better.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.496
We will make you
better than better.

34:27.432 --> 34:29.099
A superhero.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.835
Look, agent Smith,

34:31.837 --> 34:34.471
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.240
But if I ever hit "fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.509
Oh, um...

34:39.511 --> 34:41.211
Shit. We're within
500 yards of a school,

34:41.213 --> 34:42.446
so you may wanna...

34:47.385 --> 34:48.652
His drink's on him.

34:54.325 --> 34:56.159
What did he say?

35:18.616 --> 35:20.350
Hey, what's going on?

35:20.352 --> 35:22.752
Hey. Sorry.

35:24.255 --> 35:27.157
I had a Liam neeson
nightmare.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.625
I dreamt I kidnapped
his daughter

35:28.627 --> 35:30.360
and he just
wasn't having it.

35:37.902 --> 35:43.240
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

35:43.242 --> 35:46.443
At some point you have
to wonder if he's
just a bad parent.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.511
Hmm.

36:00.691 --> 36:04.694
<i> The worst part</i>
<i> about cancer isn't</i>
<i> what it does to you...</i>

36:04.696 --> 36:07.831
<i> But what it does to</i>
<i> the people you love.</i>

36:07.833 --> 36:10.534
<i> Who knew if this guy</i>
<i> could save my life...</i>

36:10.536 --> 36:13.670
<i> But I knew there was only one</i>
<i> way that I could save hers.</i>

36:17.408 --> 36:19.676
<i> Isn't that what</i>
<i> superheroes do?</i>

36:31.889 --> 36:36.226
<i> Okay. Let's pro-con</i>
<i> this superhero thing.</i>

36:36.694 --> 36:37.894
Ow.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.864
<i> Pro: They pull down</i>
<i> a gaggle of ass.</i>

36:40.866 --> 36:42.432
<i> Local dry cleaning discounts.</i>

36:42.434 --> 36:44.301
<i> Lucrative film deals,</i>
<i> both origin stories</i>

36:44.303 --> 36:46.469
<i> and larger ensemble</i>
<i> team movies.</i>

36:46.471 --> 36:49.573
Con: They're all lame-ass
teacher's pets.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.441
You know,
i can hear you.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.411
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.713
Stay right here.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.982
You've been
warned before, deadpool.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.719
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.854
You will both
be coming with us.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.790
Look, colossus,
i don't have time for

37:06.792 --> 37:08.892
the goody two-shoes
bullshit right now!

37:08.894 --> 37:10.827
And you are?

37:12.463 --> 37:14.364
Negasonic teenage warhead.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.767
Negasonic teenage...
What the shit?

37:17.769 --> 37:19.669
That's the coolest name ever!

37:21.005 --> 37:23.740
So, what, you're like,
uh, his sidekick?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.375
No. Trainee.

37:25.377 --> 37:26.776
Let me guess.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.412
X-Men left you behind
on what? Shit detail?

37:29.414 --> 37:29.414
What does that make you?

37:29.414 --> 37:32.916
Pretending you're not here,
negasonic teenage warhead.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.384
Can we trade names?

37:34.386 --> 37:35.885
Can we go?

37:35.887 --> 37:38.421
Look!
I'm a teenage girl.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.624
I'd rather be
anywhere than here.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.826
I'm all about
long sullen silences...

37:42.828 --> 37:46.763
Followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.000
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

37:50.002 --> 37:52.702
Or mean comment? Go on.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.272
You got me in a box here.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.373
Aha!

37:56.375 --> 37:58.375
We can't allow this,
deadpool.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.776
Please, come quietly.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.045
You big chrome
cock-gobbler!

38:02.047 --> 38:02.047
That's not nice.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.948
You're really gonna
fuck this up for me?

38:04.950 --> 38:09.519
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick-tips has it coming.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.455
He's pure evil.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.759
Besides...
Nobody's getting hurt.

38:20.931 --> 38:23.333
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

38:23.335 --> 38:26.569
Wade, you are
better than this.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.938
Join us.
Use your powers for good.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.006
Heads up.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.474
Be a superhero.

38:31.476 --> 38:31.476
Listen!

38:31.476 --> 38:35.011
The day I decide to
become a crime-fighting
shit-swizzler...

38:35.013 --> 38:38.415
Who rooms with a bunch
of other little whiners
at the neverland mansion...

38:38.417 --> 38:43.353
Of some creepy, old, bald,
heaven's gate-looking
motherfucker...

38:43.355 --> 38:45.021
On that day...

38:45.023 --> 38:47.424
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.893
But until then, i'mma do
what I came here to do.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.696
Either that or slap
the bitch outta you!

38:52.698 --> 38:53.963
Wade...
Hey.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.332
Zip it, sinead!

38:55.334 --> 38:56.399
Hey, douche-pool!

38:56.401 --> 38:57.701
And I hope
you're watching...

39:02.440 --> 39:04.107
Quite unfortunate.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.913
That does it!

39:11.116 --> 39:12.582
Oh!

39:12.584 --> 39:15.652
Canada!

39:16.787 --> 39:17.854
That's not good.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.022
Wade, please.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.925
Cock shot!

39:21.927 --> 39:23.760
Oh, your poor wife.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.995
You really should stop.

39:29.066 --> 39:31.668
All the dinosaurs
feared the <i> t. Rex.</i>

39:36.575 --> 39:38.508
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

39:38.510 --> 39:40.477
This is embarrassing.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.146
Please, stay down.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.749
You ever hear
of the one-legged man
in the ass-kicking contest?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.150
Do you have
off switch?

39:47.152 --> 39:48.918
Yeah, it's right next
to the prostate.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.053
Or is that the on switch?

39:50.055 --> 39:52.155
Enough!

40:00.765 --> 40:03.032
Let us go talk
to the professor.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.901
Mcavoy or Stewart?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.137
These timelines
are so confusing.

40:08.539 --> 40:11.107
"Dead or alive,
you're coming with me!"

40:11.109 --> 40:12.976
You will
recover, Wade.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.677
You always do.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.719
You ever see <i> 127 hours?</i>
Spoiler alert.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.590
Oh, my god.

40:27.592 --> 40:31.729
Nasty.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.062
Oh, there's
the money shot, baby.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.199
<i> Are you there god?</i>
<i> It's me, Margaret.</i>

40:47.178 --> 40:50.079
<i> Rock, meet bottom.</i>

40:50.081 --> 40:53.516
<i> And when life ends up</i>
<i> breathtakingly fucked...</i>

40:53.518 --> 40:57.720
<i>You can generally trace it</i>
<i>back to one big, bad decision.</i>

40:57.722 --> 41:00.924
<i> The one that sent you</i>
<i> down the road to shitsburgh.</i>

41:00.926 --> 41:04.627
<i> This? Well, this was mine.</i>

41:04.629 --> 41:07.497
Mr. Wilson.

41:07.499 --> 41:11.935
Nothing warms my heart
more than a change
of someone else's.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.770
You finally hit "fuck it."

41:14.839 --> 41:17.574
Just promise
you'll do right by me.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.642
So I can do right
by someone else.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.544
Of course.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.246
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.049
Or animated.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.123
Move it! Keep moving.

41:46.136 --> 41:49.072
This place seems sanitary.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.274
My first request
is warmer hands.

41:51.276 --> 41:55.178
Oh! And, Jesus,
a warmer table.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.948
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.884
I'm thinking
"pork and beans."

42:04.154 --> 42:06.289
Easy.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.693
Aren't you a little
strong for a lady?

42:11.262 --> 42:12.996
I'm calling wang.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.101
What's up with the matches?

42:18.103 --> 42:21.037
Oral fixation
or just a big Stallone fan?

42:22.307 --> 42:23.806
Patience, angel.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.309
All in good time.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.311
Are you here for
the turndown service,
or what?

42:29.914 --> 42:29.915
We have another talker.

42:29.915 --> 42:33.049
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.251
Shut the fuck up.

42:38.589 --> 42:40.623
Mr. Wilson, my name's ajax.

42:41.592 --> 42:44.727
I manage this workshop.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.997
Ah, my welcome speech used to
be full of euphemisms like...

42:47.999 --> 42:49.632
"This may hurt a little."

42:49.634 --> 42:51.701
"This may cause you
some discomfort."

42:51.703 --> 42:54.003
But I've grown blunt.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.739
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

42:56.741 --> 43:00.276
It's a private institution
that turns reclamation
projects like yourself...

43:00.278 --> 43:03.813
Into men of
extraordinary abilities.

43:05.282 --> 43:08.751
But if you think
super-human powers
are acquired painlessly...

43:09.620 --> 43:11.020
Wrong.

43:11.022 --> 43:12.689
I'm injecting you
with a serum...

43:12.691 --> 43:15.291
That activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

43:15.293 --> 43:19.295
For it to work
we need to subject you
to extreme stress.

43:24.803 --> 43:28.838
You've heard that whole
"make an omelet,
break some eggs" bit, right?

43:28.840 --> 43:31.307
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

43:31.309 --> 43:34.377
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

43:34.379 --> 43:37.246
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

43:37.248 --> 43:40.383
It made angel
inhumanly strong.

43:40.385 --> 43:44.988
In my case,
it enhanced my reflexes.

43:44.990 --> 43:48.024
Also scorched
my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

43:49.727 --> 43:53.663
And, in fact,
i no longer feel anything.

44:02.006 --> 44:05.074
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.810
You have something
in your teeth.

44:07.812 --> 44:10.013
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

44:10.015 --> 44:13.116
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

44:14.953 --> 44:17.420
It's been bothering me
for a long time.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.123
Ah, made you look.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.891
Hey, is ajax
your actual name?

44:21.893 --> 44:23.726
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

44:23.728 --> 44:24.861
What is it, really?

44:24.863 --> 44:27.130
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

44:27.132 --> 44:29.432
Mitch? The rickster?

44:29.434 --> 44:31.300
Is it basil fawlty?

44:31.302 --> 44:33.269
Oh, joke away.

44:33.271 --> 44:34.771
One thing that never
survives this place

44:34.773 --> 44:36.773
is a sense of humor.

44:36.775 --> 44:37.940
We'll see about that.

44:37.942 --> 44:39.308
I suppose we will.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.278
He's all yours.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.047
Oh, come on.

44:44.049 --> 44:45.448
You're gonna leave me
all alone here.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.216
With less-angry
Rosie O'Donnell?

44:51.455 --> 44:53.756
<i> This is how</i>
<i> it's going to work.</i>

44:53.758 --> 44:57.260
<i> Adrenaline acts as a catalyst</i>
<i> for the serum...</i>

44:57.262 --> 44:59.929
<i> So we're going</i>
<i> to have to make you suffer.</i>

45:01.465 --> 45:03.466
<i> If you're lucky,</i>
<i>the mutant genes will activate</i>

45:03.468 --> 45:06.402
<i> and manifest in</i>
<i> a spectacular fashion.</i>

45:10.774 --> 45:13.476
<i> If not, well, we'll</i>
<i>have to keep on hurting you...</i>

45:15.313 --> 45:16.746
<i> In new and different ways,</i>

45:16.748 --> 45:18.147
<i> each more painful</i>
<i> than the last...</i>

45:20.818 --> 45:23.152
Until you finally mutate.

45:24.788 --> 45:26.022
Or die.

45:32.830 --> 45:34.363
You mean a bucket list?

45:34.365 --> 45:36.833
Like a fuck-it list.

45:36.835 --> 45:38.101
I'd really like
to light a spliff

45:38.103 --> 45:40.036
off the olympic torch.

45:40.038 --> 45:41.971
Pass it
to me right after.

45:41.973 --> 45:45.374
Let's not forget naked
tandem base-jumping

45:45.376 --> 45:48.978
with the wnba's
sacramento monarchs.

45:48.980 --> 45:52.482
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

45:52.484 --> 45:55.818
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-birney a Dutch oven.

45:55.820 --> 45:58.988
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-birney.

46:03.460 --> 46:07.063
Making banana pancakes
for my kids.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.468
Vanessa.

46:16.006 --> 46:18.341
<i> I wanna see Vanessa.</i>

46:18.343 --> 46:19.876
You're lovely.

46:19.878 --> 46:23.246
I don't know about
anyone else, but I'm touched.

46:23.248 --> 46:24.280
We were just joking.

46:24.282 --> 46:26.816
No, no. It's okay.

46:27.885 --> 46:30.253
I encourage distractions.

46:30.255 --> 46:32.555
Wouldn't want you giving up
on us, now would we?

46:32.557 --> 46:34.490
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

46:35.425 --> 46:37.960
How tough can he be...

46:37.962 --> 46:40.963
With a name like Francis?

46:41.365 --> 46:42.899
Francis?

46:42.901 --> 46:44.901
That's his legal name.

46:44.903 --> 46:48.371
He got "ajax"
from the dish soap.

46:50.307 --> 46:54.076
F, r, a, n, c, I...

46:54.378 --> 46:55.945
Oops!

46:57.514 --> 47:00.483
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.921
Fyi, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

47:04.923 --> 47:06.289
You are so
relentlessly annoying.

47:06.291 --> 47:07.323
Thanks.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.958
Never heard that before.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.028
Why don't you do us all
a favor and shut the fuck up?

47:12.030 --> 47:14.096
Or I'll sew
your pretty mouth shut.

47:14.398 --> 47:15.865
Oh...

47:15.867 --> 47:17.466
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.101
See, here's the problem with

47:19.103 --> 47:20.937
round-the-clock torture...

47:20.939 --> 47:23.973
Is that you can't really
step it up from there.

47:26.410 --> 47:28.945
Is that what you think?

47:34.084 --> 47:36.552
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

47:37.354 --> 47:39.155
Nothing will.

47:39.157 --> 47:39.157
Now, what we're going to do is

47:39.157 --> 47:42.191
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

47:42.193 --> 47:45.094
To the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

47:45.096 --> 47:46.362
If your brainwaves slow,

47:46.364 --> 47:48.965
meaning you're
about to pass out...

47:48.967 --> 47:50.166
Then we'll turn up the O2.

47:51.101 --> 47:52.501
If your heart rate slows...

47:52.503 --> 47:55.304
Meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

47:55.306 --> 47:57.306
We'll turn it back down.

47:57.308 --> 47:58.975
And that's where
we'll leave you.

47:58.977 --> 48:01.344
Right there.

48:01.346 --> 48:03.613
Oh, and I thought
you guys were dicks before.

48:03.615 --> 48:06.949
You know
the funniest part of this?

48:06.951 --> 48:10.119
You still think we're making
you a superhero.

48:10.121 --> 48:13.556
You. A dishonorable discharge.

48:14.258 --> 48:16.392
Hip-deep in hookers.

48:17.094 --> 48:18.661
You're nothing.

48:19.529 --> 48:21.998
Little secret, Wade.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.933
This workshop
doesn't make superheroes,

48:23.935 --> 48:27.136
we make super-slaves.

48:27.138 --> 48:28.971
We're gonna fit you
with a control collar

48:28.973 --> 48:31.540
and auction you off
to the highest bidder.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.943
Who knows what
they'll have you doing?

48:33.945 --> 48:37.346
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

48:39.416 --> 48:42.685
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

48:42.687 --> 48:45.354
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

48:50.494 --> 48:53.396
You're never going home
after this.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.631
Now there's a brave face.

48:56.566 --> 48:58.301
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

49:00.504 --> 49:04.507
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

49:06.376 --> 49:08.177
Enjoy your weekend.

49:08.179 --> 49:09.979
"Weekend"? Back up.

49:09.981 --> 49:11.213
Weekend?

49:52.723 --> 49:55.024
<i> Did I say</i>
<i> this was a love story?</i>

49:55.026 --> 49:57.426
<i> No, it's a horror movie.</i>

50:13.777 --> 50:16.112
Fucking hell.

50:16.114 --> 50:19.382
Looks like someone lost his
shot at homecoming king.

50:19.384 --> 50:21.517
What have you done to me?

50:21.519 --> 50:23.052
I've merely raised
your stress levels

50:23.054 --> 50:24.787
high enough
to trigger a mutation.

50:24.789 --> 50:27.656
You sadistic fuck!

50:27.658 --> 50:30.126
I've cured you, Wade.

50:30.128 --> 50:32.762
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

50:32.764 --> 50:35.598
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

50:36.767 --> 50:39.468
Yeah, I've seen similar
side-effects before.

50:40.670 --> 50:41.737
I could cure them...

50:45.375 --> 50:47.176
But where's the fun in that?

50:49.379 --> 50:52.081
Now, I'm gonna
shut you in again, Wade.

50:53.650 --> 50:55.684
Not because I need to.

50:59.556 --> 51:01.424
Because I want to.

51:15.705 --> 51:17.306
Oh, well.

51:17.308 --> 51:18.541
Go ahead.

51:21.511 --> 51:23.379
Oh, you smell like shit.

51:24.548 --> 51:26.582
Whoa!

51:26.584 --> 51:28.551
Motherfucker.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.519
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all right,
it's all right.

51:31.555 --> 51:33.556
I think we owe him
that one, yeah?

51:33.558 --> 51:36.125
You take off. Go on.

51:36.693 --> 51:38.227
Off you go.

51:49.172 --> 51:50.739
Quick question.

51:52.876 --> 51:55.144
What's my name?

52:00.717 --> 52:02.251
Didn't think so.

52:03.887 --> 52:06.755
<i> Sorry, Francis.</i>
<i> My lips are sealed.</i>

54:03.273 --> 54:04.607
You don't want to kill me.

54:04.609 --> 54:06.942
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

55:03.667 --> 55:05.334
What's my name?

55:11.408 --> 55:12.608
Wade.

56:19.843 --> 56:22.945
<i> I didn't just get</i>
<i> the cure to</i> El cancer...

56:24.481 --> 56:27.082
<i> I got the cure</i>
<i> to</i> El <i> everything.</i>

56:30.754 --> 56:32.988
<i> But there was</i>
<i> only one thing...</i>

56:32.990 --> 56:34.757
<i> That really mattered.</i>

57:04.053 --> 57:05.120
Come on, let's go.

57:10.593 --> 57:13.429
Oh, that must hurt.

57:14.164 --> 57:16.665
Thank you so much.

57:27.677 --> 57:29.912
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

57:29.914 --> 57:31.480
Look at his face.

57:31.482 --> 57:33.816
Oh, my god. Poor guy.

57:33.818 --> 57:34.950
Honey, don't stare.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.218
Freak.

57:56.573 --> 58:00.075
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

58:00.077 --> 58:02.744
Come on, Wade,
it can't be that bad.

58:02.746 --> 58:02.746
Ah, bullshit!

58:02.746 --> 58:07.483
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

58:07.485 --> 58:10.018
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

58:10.020 --> 58:11.753
Oh! Oh.

58:11.755 --> 58:12.921
Do you like what you see?

58:12.923 --> 58:14.656
No.

58:14.658 --> 58:16.124
You look like an avocado

58:16.126 --> 58:18.694
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

58:18.696 --> 58:19.862
Yeah.

58:19.864 --> 58:21.930
Not gently.
Like it was hate-fucking.

58:21.932 --> 58:23.866
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

58:23.868 --> 58:25.801
And that was
the only catharsis

58:25.803 --> 58:27.703
that they could find
without violence.

58:27.705 --> 58:30.105
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

58:30.107 --> 58:32.941
Is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

58:32.943 --> 58:34.877
And he's gone. Poof!

58:34.879 --> 58:36.712
Yeah, well you
gotta do something
to remedy this...

58:36.714 --> 58:37.846
Because as of now,

58:37.848 --> 58:39.748
you only have
one course of action.

58:39.750 --> 58:40.983
Damn straight.

58:40.985 --> 58:42.851
Find Francis.
Star in horror films.

58:42.853 --> 58:43.952
What?

58:43.954 --> 58:46.021
Star in your own horror films.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.623
Because you look
like Freddy krueger

58:47.625 --> 58:50.859
face-fucked
a topographical map of Utah.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.728
Here's what
I'm actually gonna do.

58:52.730 --> 58:53.862
I'm gonna work
through his crew

58:53.864 --> 58:53.864
until somebody
gives up Francis...

58:53.864 --> 58:57.833
Force him to fix this, then
put a bullet in his skull...

58:57.835 --> 58:59.601
And fuck the brain hole.

58:59.603 --> 59:02.738
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.840
But the douchebag does
thinks you're dead, right?

59:04.842 --> 59:06.108
Yeah.

59:06.110 --> 59:07.643
That's good.
You should keep it that way.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.244
What, like, wear a mask?

59:09.246 --> 59:12.247
Yes. A very thick mask.
All the time.

59:12.882 --> 59:14.016
I am sorry...

59:14.018 --> 59:16.752
You are haunting.

59:16.754 --> 59:18.754
Your face is
the stuff of nightmares.

59:18.756 --> 59:20.055
Like a testicle with teeth.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.890
You will die alone.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.059
I mean, if you could die.

59:24.061 --> 59:26.128
Ideally, for others' sake.

59:26.130 --> 59:27.763
That'll do.

59:27.765 --> 59:29.631
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

59:29.633 --> 59:31.867
Like Wade the wisecracker...

59:31.869 --> 59:35.003
Or scaredevil,
Mr. neverdie.

59:35.638 --> 59:36.939
Oh, shit.

59:37.307 --> 59:39.274
What?

59:39.276 --> 59:41.310
I put all my money
on you and now...

59:41.312 --> 59:42.911
I just realized
I'm never gonna
win the, uh...

59:42.913 --> 59:44.012
Dead pool.

59:47.917 --> 59:50.218
Captain deadpool...

59:52.055 --> 59:53.188
No, just...

59:53.190 --> 59:55.023
Just deadpool, yeah.
Just deadpool.

59:55.025 --> 59:57.192
To you, Mr. pool.

59:57.194 --> 59:58.594
Deadpool.

59:58.596 --> 59:59.895
That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

1:00:14.310 --> 1:00:17.079
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it.

1:00:17.081 --> 1:00:18.714
Where's Francis?

1:00:32.695 --> 1:00:34.296
Where's Francis?

1:00:42.705 --> 1:00:44.740
Seltzer water
and lemon for blood.

1:00:45.942 --> 1:00:48.910
Or wear red. Dumbass.

1:01:07.431 --> 1:01:09.064
Don't make me
ask twice.

1:01:10.299 --> 1:01:11.867
Where...

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:14.403
Is Francis?

1:01:14.405 --> 1:01:16.238
He made me ask twice.

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:18.306
Is the mask muffling my voice?

1:01:23.046 --> 1:01:24.680
Where's Francis?

1:01:27.151 --> 1:01:29.084
Where the fuck is Francis?

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:41.063
You're about to be killed
by a zamboni.

1:01:41.065 --> 1:01:42.297
Where's Francis?

1:01:43.767 --> 1:01:45.400
No! Please!

1:01:45.402 --> 1:01:48.336
Oh, god! I'm so sorry!

1:01:49.406 --> 1:01:52.307
Oh! You little
spider monkey!

1:01:55.178 --> 1:01:58.780
Where... is... Francis?

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:01.083
This is confusing.

1:02:01.085 --> 1:02:02.417
Is it sexist to hit you?

1:02:02.419 --> 1:02:04.086
Is it more sexist
to not hit you?

1:02:04.088 --> 1:02:06.455
I mean, the line
gets real... blurry.

1:02:10.226 --> 1:02:12.294
Tell me where
your fucking boss is

1:02:12.296 --> 1:02:14.162
or you're gonna die!

1:02:14.164 --> 1:02:15.897
In five minutes!

1:02:25.942 --> 1:02:27.843
Don't hesitate to call me.

1:02:43.259 --> 1:02:45.460
Nice to see you, Jared.

1:02:46.529 --> 1:02:48.363
I'll take the footlong...

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:49.431
Fully loaded.

1:03:03.513 --> 1:03:05.080
Whoa, whoa!

1:03:05.082 --> 1:03:06.815
41 confirmed kills.

1:03:06.817 --> 1:03:09.184
Now it's 89.
About to be 90.

1:03:09.952 --> 1:03:11.086
Mr. Wilson?

1:03:11.088 --> 1:03:12.187
Ding-ding.

1:03:12.989 --> 1:03:15.290
You're looking
very alive.

1:03:15.292 --> 1:03:17.559
Ha! Only on the outside!

1:03:17.561 --> 1:03:19.227
This is not going to
end well for me, is it?

1:03:19.229 --> 1:03:20.529
This is not gonna
end well for you, no.

1:03:20.531 --> 1:03:21.897
Where's your boss?

1:03:21.899 --> 1:03:23.398
I can tell you exactly...

1:03:25.169 --> 1:03:27.536
Oh, you'll tell me.
But first...

1:03:27.538 --> 1:03:30.005
You might wanna
look away for this.

1:03:30.007 --> 1:03:31.306
Now this little piggy
went to...

1:03:33.309 --> 1:03:35.811
Thank you, agent Smith.

1:03:39.248 --> 1:03:40.315
Taxi!

1:03:41.851 --> 1:03:44.152
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1:03:46.023 --> 1:03:47.389
And we all know
how this turned out.

1:03:50.293 --> 1:03:52.527
<i>Whoops!</i>
<i>You weren't meant to see that.</i>

1:04:00.436 --> 1:04:02.604
There. All caught up.

1:04:10.279 --> 1:04:12.881
We're here.

1:04:12.883 --> 1:04:16.251
Sorry about
bleeding in all
your garbage.

1:04:22.425 --> 1:04:24.526
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

1:04:25.027 --> 1:04:26.595
Whoo!

1:04:26.597 --> 1:04:29.297
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed...

1:04:29.299 --> 1:04:31.466
Like the kind where
your year-long plan

1:04:31.468 --> 1:04:35.070
ends with the wrong guy
getting dismembered!

1:04:35.072 --> 1:04:37.973
That said, when it comes time
to licking wounds,

1:04:37.975 --> 1:04:40.208
there's no place like home.

1:04:40.210 --> 1:04:42.310
Ah, and I share that home
with someone you've met,

1:04:42.312 --> 1:04:45.080
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, al.

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:46.982
God, I miss cocaine.

1:04:46.984 --> 1:04:46.984
Her.

1:04:46.984 --> 1:04:51.953
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

1:04:51.955 --> 1:04:55.056
That's like 16 walls.

1:04:55.058 --> 1:04:56.524
She's like Robin to my Batman,

1:04:56.526 --> 1:05:00.462
except she's old,
and black, and blind.

1:05:00.464 --> 1:05:02.497
And I think
she's in love with me.

1:05:02.499 --> 1:05:06.101
<i> Wait, pretty sure</i>
<i> Robin loves Batman, too.</i>

1:05:16.013 --> 1:05:17.078
Al?

1:05:19.348 --> 1:05:20.949
Morning, sleepyhead.

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:24.419
It smells like
old lady pants in here.

1:05:24.421 --> 1:05:26.421
Yes, I'm old.
I wear pants.

1:05:26.423 --> 1:05:28.290
But you're no lady.

1:05:28.292 --> 1:05:31.559
Oh! So comfy.

1:05:31.561 --> 1:05:34.629
Upside of being blind:
I've never seen you in crocs.

1:05:34.631 --> 1:05:36.164
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

1:05:36.166 --> 1:05:37.666
Yes, I know.

1:05:37.668 --> 1:05:40.435
Downside of being blind...

1:05:40.437 --> 1:05:43.004
I hear everything
in this duplex.

1:05:45.041 --> 1:05:46.274
Sit on a stick.

1:05:46.276 --> 1:05:47.309
Bactin?

1:05:47.311 --> 1:05:51.446
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

1:05:52.515 --> 1:05:54.316
How's that kullen
coming along?

1:05:54.318 --> 1:05:56.418
Ikea doesn't assemble itself,
you know.

1:05:56.420 --> 1:05:59.421
You're telling me.
I don't mind the kullen.

1:05:59.423 --> 1:06:02.057
It's an improvement
on the hurdal.

1:06:02.059 --> 1:06:04.592
Please. Anything's
an improvement
over the hurdal.

1:06:04.594 --> 1:06:08.697
I'd have taken an hemnes
or a trysil over the hurdal.

1:06:08.699 --> 1:06:11.566
Oh, no, I didn't get excited
till I saw the kullen.

1:06:11.568 --> 1:06:12.734
Screw, please.

1:06:12.736 --> 1:06:14.302
Here? Now?
Just kidding.

1:06:14.304 --> 1:06:15.470
I know it's been decades.

1:06:15.472 --> 1:06:16.638
You'd be surprised.

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:18.506
Pretty grossed out.

1:06:20.443 --> 1:06:23.011
Ta... da.

1:06:28.584 --> 1:06:32.220
I wish I never heard
of craigslist.

1:06:32.222 --> 1:06:33.488
And I quote,
"looking for roommate,

1:06:33.490 --> 1:06:34.756
"blind to
life's imperfections.

1:06:34.758 --> 1:06:34.758
"Must be good with hands."

1:06:34.758 --> 1:06:38.326
Or would you rather I build
the Ikea, and you pay rent?

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:40.295
Why such a douche
this morning?

1:06:41.063 --> 1:06:41.064
Let's recap.

1:06:41.064 --> 1:06:44.466
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak...

1:06:44.468 --> 1:06:46.267
Slipped through
my arms today...

1:06:47.737 --> 1:06:49.437
Arm.

1:06:49.439 --> 1:06:50.772
Catching him was
my only chance

1:06:50.774 --> 1:06:52.607
to be hot again,
get my super sexy ex back...

1:06:52.609 --> 1:06:55.076
And prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

1:06:55.078 --> 1:06:57.078
So, yeah,
today was about as much fun

1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:58.713
as a sandpaper dildo.

1:07:00.617 --> 1:07:02.283
#driveby.

1:07:19.635 --> 1:07:21.669
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

1:07:24.106 --> 1:07:26.775
Fucking Wade Wilson.

1:07:26.777 --> 1:07:29.778
I suppose I'd wear a mask too
if I had a face like that.

1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.446
I only wish I healed the same.

1:07:35.384 --> 1:07:38.253
Still, we'll put him
out of our misery.

1:07:38.255 --> 1:07:39.754
On our terms.

1:07:39.756 --> 1:07:41.623
Right.
And when he heals?

1:07:42.558 --> 1:07:43.758
He can't.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:46.394
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1:07:46.396 --> 1:07:50.432
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

1:07:51.734 --> 1:07:53.334
I like a challenge.

1:07:54.570 --> 1:07:56.704
But he's bad
for business.

1:07:56.706 --> 1:07:58.540
Now let's go
find him.

1:07:59.408 --> 1:08:00.475
Oh.

1:08:02.846 --> 1:08:04.446
Tylenol pm?

1:08:04.448 --> 1:08:07.348
You can stick that
where you stuck the bactin.

1:08:07.350 --> 1:08:09.717
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

1:08:09.719 --> 1:08:13.788
And I am orbiting
fucking saturn right now.

1:08:16.593 --> 1:08:19.561
But I appreciate the gesture.

1:08:19.563 --> 1:08:24.165
Am I crazy,
or is your hand
really small?

1:08:24.167 --> 1:08:26.201
About the size of
a kfc spork.

1:08:26.203 --> 1:08:28.103
Ugh.

1:08:28.105 --> 1:08:30.338
I get why you're so pissy...

1:08:30.340 --> 1:08:31.873
But your mood's
never gonna brighten

1:08:31.875 --> 1:08:33.341
till you find this woman...

1:08:33.343 --> 1:08:34.709
And tell her how you feel.

1:08:34.711 --> 1:08:36.411
What do I keep telling you,
Mrs. Magoo?

1:08:36.413 --> 1:08:38.246
She wouldn't have me.

1:08:38.248 --> 1:08:39.881
If you could see me,
you'd understand.

1:08:39.883 --> 1:08:41.216
Looks aren't everything.

1:08:41.218 --> 1:08:42.350
Looks are everything.

1:08:42.352 --> 1:08:44.452
You ever heard
David Beckham speak?

1:08:44.454 --> 1:08:46.788
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:48.356
You think Ryan Reynolds
got this far

1:08:48.358 --> 1:08:50.225
on his superior acting method?

1:08:50.227 --> 1:08:51.493
Love is blind, Wade.

1:08:51.495 --> 1:08:52.560
No.

1:08:53.596 --> 1:08:55.530
You're blind.

1:08:55.532 --> 1:08:58.500
So, you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

1:08:58.502 --> 1:09:00.602
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty...

1:09:00.604 --> 1:09:01.636
And then I'm gonna
come up with

1:09:01.638 --> 1:09:02.737
a whole new
Christmas day plan.

1:09:03.539 --> 1:09:04.806
In the meantime,

1:09:04.808 --> 1:09:06.808
you might wanna
leave the room.

1:09:06.810 --> 1:09:09.410
I bet it feels huge
in this hand.

1:09:10.646 --> 1:09:13.815
Go, go, go.

1:09:13.817 --> 1:09:15.617
So, the doctor says,
"the bad news is

1:09:15.619 --> 1:09:15.619
"you don't have
that long to live."

1:09:15.619 --> 1:09:18.520
So, the patient says,
"how long do I have?"

1:09:18.522 --> 1:09:20.488
The doctor says, "five."

1:09:20.490 --> 1:09:22.223
The guy says, "five what?"

1:09:22.225 --> 1:09:25.426
And the doctor says,
"four, three, two..."

1:09:33.269 --> 1:09:34.769
Can I help you ladies?

1:09:37.406 --> 1:09:38.573
Oh, I do hope so.

1:09:42.678 --> 1:09:44.312
I heard you might be
able to point me

1:09:44.314 --> 1:09:47.415
in the direction
of a, um, friend of mine.

1:09:47.417 --> 1:09:48.483
Name of Wade Wilson.

1:09:49.852 --> 1:09:51.186
Sorry.

1:09:51.188 --> 1:09:52.720
I don't know the name.

1:09:59.929 --> 1:10:02.463
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

1:10:05.968 --> 1:10:07.936
I've seen this girl.

1:10:07.938 --> 1:10:09.437
Ah, this must be Vanessa.

1:10:09.439 --> 1:10:10.638
I've heard so much about you.

1:10:14.843 --> 1:10:17.612
Um, sweetheart,
you might wanna look around.

1:10:17.614 --> 1:10:20.381
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1:10:21.617 --> 1:10:23.451
Easy, angel.

1:10:23.453 --> 1:10:24.819
Put the little man down.

1:10:26.422 --> 1:10:28.556
We have everything
we need now.

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:30.358
You sure?

1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:33.461
You don't want
any clothes that are
not monochromatic?

1:10:33.463 --> 1:10:36.264
Have fun at your midnight
showing of <i> blade ii.</i>

1:10:38.334 --> 1:10:39.734
Whoo.

1:10:39.736 --> 1:10:41.569
Thanks for having
my back, guys.

1:10:46.508 --> 1:10:48.876
Wade, we have
a fucking problem.

1:10:48.878 --> 1:10:51.646
And by "we," I mean "you."

1:10:51.648 --> 1:10:53.781
Ah, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1:10:53.783 --> 1:10:56.718
Is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:58.886
Yeah, "afrangry",
i guess.

1:10:58.888 --> 1:11:00.755
Have you decided
what you're gonna
say to her?

1:11:00.757 --> 1:11:02.023
Fuck me!

1:11:02.025 --> 1:11:04.025
Uh, maybe not
start with that.

1:11:09.865 --> 1:11:13.334
<i> Hey, coming onto</i>
<i> our stage right now...</i>

1:11:13.336 --> 1:11:15.536
<i> Give it up for chastity!</i>

1:11:19.341 --> 1:11:21.643
Or as I like
to call her, irony.

1:11:21.645 --> 1:11:23.778
Better find her fast
before numbnuts does.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.413
How do you know
she's in here?

1:11:25.415 --> 1:11:28.583
Because I'm constantly
stalking that fox.

1:11:53.542 --> 1:11:57.812
<i> Every time I see her,</i>
<i> it's like the first time...</i>

1:11:57.814 --> 1:12:00.014
<i> Especially from this angle.</i>

1:12:23.539 --> 1:12:24.839
<i> You can't buy love,</i>

1:12:24.841 --> 1:12:27.642
<i> but you can rent it</i>
<i> for three minutes.</i>

1:12:30.579 --> 1:12:33.381
Ah, you weak motherfucker!

1:12:33.949 --> 1:12:35.016
Come on!

1:12:36.118 --> 1:12:37.585
Come on, get it together.

1:12:37.587 --> 1:12:39.654
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

1:12:43.692 --> 1:12:45.026
Here we go.

1:12:47.629 --> 1:12:49.397
Maximum effort.

1:12:52.735 --> 1:12:53.901
Vanessa.

1:12:56.472 --> 1:12:58.473
Someone out back
asking for you.

1:12:58.475 --> 1:13:00.641
Something about, uh,
an old boyfriend.

1:13:27.870 --> 1:13:29.003
I knew it was you.

1:13:30.806 --> 1:13:32.840
The weird,
curvy edges.

1:13:34.410 --> 1:13:36.144
Like a Jigsaw puzzle.

1:13:46.155 --> 1:13:48.122
You have Wade Wilson
to thank for this.

1:13:57.065 --> 1:13:58.800
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1:13:58.802 --> 1:14:00.768
Uh, I saw her
head to the back.

1:14:00.770 --> 1:14:02.136
Go get her, tiger.

1:14:25.093 --> 1:14:27.595
Fuck. Fuck!

1:14:30.098 --> 1:14:31.933
Motherfucker!

1:14:31.935 --> 1:14:33.067
Wait, wait.
Let's... just...

1:14:33.069 --> 1:14:33.069
Cock juggling...

1:14:33.069 --> 1:14:35.203
We can talk about
what we're gonna...

1:14:35.205 --> 1:14:36.237
Jiminy! Fuck face!

1:14:36.239 --> 1:14:37.672
Okay, or you
can hit that.

1:14:37.674 --> 1:14:39.574
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fuck! Fuck!

1:14:39.576 --> 1:14:40.942
No, no.
All right. Hey!

1:14:40.944 --> 1:14:42.710
Fuck! Fuck!

1:14:42.712 --> 1:14:44.245
Fuck!
Hey, um...

1:14:44.247 --> 1:14:46.848
Whoa! Whoa!
Relax. Relax. Okay.

1:14:46.850 --> 1:14:48.149
Okay. I think
that's a good start.

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:50.218
Oh, I'm gonna rip
his motherfucking...

1:14:50.220 --> 1:14:51.486
Wait.

1:14:51.488 --> 1:14:52.954
Find it! Find it.
What?

1:14:52.956 --> 1:14:54.822
I'm gonna get angry.
Okay. All right.

1:14:54.824 --> 1:14:56.691
All right. Okay. All right.

1:14:56.693 --> 1:14:57.992
Here. This is Vanessa.

1:14:57.994 --> 1:15:00.027
What?
No, wait. It's Francis.

1:15:00.029 --> 1:15:02.830
He wants you
to come to him.

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:04.599
What is that?
That's the shit emoji.

1:15:04.601 --> 1:15:06.734
You know, it's the turd
with the smiling face
and the eyes?

1:15:06.736 --> 1:15:09.070
I thought it was
chocolate yogurt
for so long.

1:15:09.771 --> 1:15:11.005
I need guns.

1:15:11.007 --> 1:15:12.139
Okay, which ones?

1:15:12.141 --> 1:15:13.274
I need all the guns!

1:15:13.276 --> 1:15:14.742
All right. Okay.

1:15:35.197 --> 1:15:36.831
That's about
3,000 rounds.

1:15:37.766 --> 1:15:40.134
We all know
what I can do with 12.

1:15:40.136 --> 1:15:42.303
Hey, hey,
careful with that,
Ronnie milsap!

1:15:42.305 --> 1:15:43.671
We're downrange.

1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:46.607
I was gonna
spend the night

1:15:46.609 --> 1:15:49.744
assembling the borje,
but this is holding
my interest.

1:15:49.746 --> 1:15:52.647
I told you, we're going with
the urvaj, not the borje.

1:15:52.649 --> 1:15:54.649
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1:15:54.651 --> 1:15:57.318
Shit. That's all the pieces
in the house.

1:15:57.320 --> 1:15:59.654
Nah, nah... come on.
Let's go. Cough it up.

1:15:59.656 --> 1:16:01.122
Up, up, up.

1:16:02.157 --> 1:16:03.691
Oh. Down, down, down.

1:16:03.693 --> 1:16:04.759
Fuck you.

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:09.263
.45 Cal. I like it.

1:16:11.300 --> 1:16:12.733
Wade...

1:16:13.835 --> 1:16:16.704
I'd go with you,
but I don't want to.

1:16:19.775 --> 1:16:21.075
Uh...

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:22.276
Listen, al...

1:16:23.245 --> 1:16:25.913
If I never see
you again,

1:16:25.915 --> 1:16:29.350
I want you to know that
i love you very much.

1:16:29.352 --> 1:16:33.220
And also, uh, there's
about 116 kilos of cocaine

1:16:33.222 --> 1:16:34.755
buried somewhere
in the apartment...

1:16:34.757 --> 1:16:37.592
Right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

1:16:42.931 --> 1:16:44.365
You wanna get fucked up?

1:16:54.243 --> 1:16:55.910
Put her down
over here.

1:17:05.988 --> 1:17:07.221
Go on then.

1:17:09.725 --> 1:17:12.727
Thanks, dickless.
And I mean you.

1:17:12.729 --> 1:17:16.030
Wow. You're a talker too.
You and Wade.

1:17:16.032 --> 1:17:17.865
I've been trying
to tell you assholes,

1:17:17.867 --> 1:17:19.266
you've got the wrong girl.

1:17:19.268 --> 1:17:20.968
My old boyfriend,
he's dead.

1:17:20.970 --> 1:17:24.739
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1:17:24.741 --> 1:17:26.007
Like a cockroach...

1:17:26.009 --> 1:17:28.275
But uglier.

1:17:28.277 --> 1:17:32.913
Now, I may not feel,
but he does.

1:17:32.915 --> 1:17:34.915
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1:17:43.792 --> 1:17:45.259
Ripley, from <i> alien 3!</i>

1:17:45.894 --> 1:17:47.862
Fuck, you're old.

1:17:49.298 --> 1:17:51.766
Fake laugh.
Hiding real pain.

1:17:51.768 --> 1:17:53.100
Go get silver balls.

1:17:53.102 --> 1:17:55.670
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

1:17:55.672 --> 1:17:56.904
Oh, like there's
something wrong

1:17:56.906 --> 1:17:58.439
with eating before sundown
or saving money.

1:17:58.441 --> 1:18:01.976
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

1:18:02.411 --> 1:18:04.345
He's got my girl.

1:18:04.347 --> 1:18:06.180
You're gonna
help me get her back.

1:18:06.182 --> 1:18:08.082
Wade, is that you?

1:18:08.084 --> 1:18:09.750
Yeah, it's me, deadpool,

1:18:09.752 --> 1:18:12.687
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

1:18:15.190 --> 1:18:16.290
I'm gonna wait
out here, okay?

1:18:16.292 --> 1:18:17.858
It's a big house.

1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:19.694
It's funny that
i only ever see
two of you.

1:18:19.696 --> 1:18:21.962
It's almost like
the studio couldn't
afford another x-man.

1:18:25.333 --> 1:18:26.967
And that is why,
in my opinion...

1:18:26.969 --> 1:18:30.705
The movie <i> cocoon</i>
is pure pornography.

1:18:30.707 --> 1:18:32.373
Who brought
this twinkly man?

1:18:32.375 --> 1:18:34.475
Twinkly, but deadly.

1:18:34.477 --> 1:18:37.078
My chrome-penised
friend back there

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:39.180
has agreed
to do me this solid.

1:18:39.182 --> 1:18:41.182
In exchange,
i said that I would

1:18:41.184 --> 1:18:43.217
consider joining his boy band.

1:18:43.219 --> 1:18:44.485
It's not boy band.

1:18:44.487 --> 1:18:46.320
Sure it's not.

1:18:46.322 --> 1:18:49.356
So,
any luck winning gita back?

1:18:49.358 --> 1:18:51.959
I tried to hold on tight,
Mr. pool...

1:18:51.961 --> 1:18:56.197
But bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1:18:56.199 --> 1:18:58.032
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

1:19:03.872 --> 1:19:05.439
Dopinder.
Hmm?

1:19:06.842 --> 1:19:07.908
What was that?

1:19:08.477 --> 1:19:09.877
Uh...

1:19:09.879 --> 1:19:15.449
That was bandhu
in the trunk.

1:19:16.118 --> 1:19:16.119
Ban who?

1:19:16.119 --> 1:19:20.254
My romantic rival bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1:19:20.256 --> 1:19:22.022
I'm doing as you said, dp.

1:19:22.024 --> 1:19:24.024
I plan to gut him
like a tandoori fish,

1:19:24.026 --> 1:19:25.926
then dump his carcass
on gita's doorstep.

1:19:27.129 --> 1:19:28.896
I did not tell him
to do that.

1:19:28.898 --> 1:19:31.499
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1:19:31.501 --> 1:19:34.902
Dopinder, this is no way
to win gita's heart back!

1:19:34.904 --> 1:19:34.904
I'm so proud of you.

1:19:34.904 --> 1:19:38.172
Drop bandhu off,
safe and gentle-like.

1:19:38.174 --> 1:19:39.240
Kill him.

1:19:39.242 --> 1:19:41.408
And then,
win gita back...

1:19:41.410 --> 1:19:44.278
The old fashioned way:
With your boyish charm.

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.880
Kidnap her.

1:19:47.182 --> 1:19:48.382
He's super dead.

1:19:48.917 --> 1:19:49.984
Whoa!

1:19:53.889 --> 1:19:55.422
I presume a crisp
high five?

1:19:55.424 --> 1:19:58.292
For you? 10.

1:19:58.294 --> 1:20:01.162
Okay, guys,
let's get out there
and make a difference.

1:20:01.164 --> 1:20:03.130
You know what to do.

1:20:04.032 --> 1:20:06.801
Knock 'em dead,
pool boy!

1:20:07.903 --> 1:20:09.970
Time to make
the chimi-fuckin'-changas.

1:20:11.306 --> 1:20:13.040
<i> Not often</i>
<i> a dude ruins your face...</i>

1:20:13.042 --> 1:20:16.043
<i>Skull-stomps your sanity,</i>
<i>grabs your future baby mama...</i>

1:20:16.045 --> 1:20:17.812
<i> And personally sees to four</i>

1:20:17.814 --> 1:20:20.214
<i> of your five</i>
<i> shittiest moments.</i>

1:20:20.216 --> 1:20:24.418
<i> Let's just say it's beginning</i>
<i> to look a lot like Christmas.</i>

1:20:37.332 --> 1:20:38.833
Hey.

1:20:38.835 --> 1:20:40.134
Where's your duffle bag?

1:20:58.954 --> 1:21:01.922
Bandhu?

1:21:01.924 --> 1:21:03.991
<i> Leave a message</i>
<i> and have a happy day.</i>

1:21:03.993 --> 1:21:05.359
God damn it!

1:21:05.361 --> 1:21:07.127
I'm gonna do this
the old fashioned way...

1:21:07.129 --> 1:21:10.564
With two swords
and maximum effort.

1:21:11.499 --> 1:21:12.600
Cue the music.

1:21:28.650 --> 1:21:31.652
Wade Wilson!

1:21:31.654 --> 1:21:33.387
What's my name?

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:35.589
Oh, i'mma fuckin'
spell it out for ya.

1:21:37.959 --> 1:21:39.093
Go get some.

1:21:39.095 --> 1:21:40.261
Superhero landing.

1:21:40.263 --> 1:21:41.395
She's gonna do
a superhero landing.

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:42.463
Wait for it.

1:21:45.667 --> 1:21:46.967
Whoo!

1:21:46.969 --> 1:21:48.535
Superhero landing!

1:21:48.537 --> 1:21:50.037
You know,
that's really hard
on your knees.

1:21:50.039 --> 1:21:52.006
Totally impractical.
They all do it.

1:21:52.008 --> 1:21:55.276
You're a lovely lady, but
I'm saving myself for Francis.

1:21:55.278 --> 1:21:56.577
That's why
i brought him.

1:21:56.579 --> 1:21:59.914
I prefer not
to hit a woman,
so please...

1:22:07.022 --> 1:22:10.124
I mean,
that's why I brought her?

1:22:11.526 --> 1:22:13.694
Oh, no, finish your tweet.
It's not... that's...

1:22:13.696 --> 1:22:15.396
Just give us a second.
Yeah.

1:22:15.398 --> 1:22:16.931
There you go.
Hashtag it.

1:22:18.166 --> 1:22:20.100
Go get her, tiger.

1:22:26.574 --> 1:22:30.411
Oh, I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

1:22:31.146 --> 1:22:32.947
All right, then. Fire!

1:22:44.359 --> 1:22:46.093
Finish fucking her
the fuck up!

1:22:46.095 --> 1:22:47.194
Language, please.

1:22:47.196 --> 1:22:48.429
Suck a cock.

1:23:14.356 --> 1:23:16.156
Look away, child.

1:23:16.658 --> 1:23:18.192
Look away!

1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:26.734
Wait!

1:23:26.736 --> 1:23:28.068
Wait!

1:23:28.070 --> 1:23:29.103
Cease fire!

1:23:29.105 --> 1:23:30.404
Cease fire!

1:23:30.406 --> 1:23:32.039
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1:23:33.274 --> 1:23:37.111
You only work for that
shit-spackled muppet fart.

1:23:37.113 --> 1:23:39.279
So, i'mma give you a chance

1:23:39.281 --> 1:23:41.148
for y'all to lay down
your firearms...

1:23:41.150 --> 1:23:44.218
In exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle...

1:23:44.220 --> 1:23:47.788
Possibly even
lover-like treatment.

1:23:49.625 --> 1:23:50.791
Fine.

1:23:50.793 --> 1:23:52.092
Commando!

1:25:04.099 --> 1:25:05.232
Teabag!

1:25:09.604 --> 1:25:10.671
Bob?

1:25:11.606 --> 1:25:11.607
Wade?

1:25:11.607 --> 1:25:14.108
Oh, my god,
i haven't seen you since...

1:25:14.110 --> 1:25:16.410
Jacksonville. Fridays.
Since tgi Fridays.

1:25:17.212 --> 1:25:19.446
Well, what the hell!

1:25:19.448 --> 1:25:21.115
God, come here, you.

1:25:23.185 --> 1:25:25.586
How are the kids?
Good?

1:25:25.588 --> 1:25:27.421
And Gail, she still fixing
that tuna casserole?

1:25:27.423 --> 1:25:29.256
So good.
But bad for the waistline,

1:25:29.258 --> 1:25:30.424
if you know what
I'm talking about.

1:25:34.896 --> 1:25:37.131
Oh!

1:25:37.133 --> 1:25:40.467
Your... on the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1:25:40.469 --> 1:25:41.735
That is so sweet.

1:25:41.737 --> 1:25:42.870
Uh...

1:25:42.872 --> 1:25:44.138
Thanks.

1:25:51.513 --> 1:25:56.217
Yoo-hoo!

1:25:56.217 --> 1:25:57.751
Does he
write you notes too?

1:25:57.753 --> 1:26:00.154
He's such a romantic.

1:26:00.156 --> 1:26:01.555
Don't worry, baby.
I'm comin'.

1:26:02.757 --> 1:26:04.291
Fire!

1:26:11.499 --> 1:26:13.267
Hey!

1:26:13.269 --> 1:26:14.334
Climb on!

1:26:51.306 --> 1:26:52.806
Motherfucking...

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:06.687
Motherfucker should have
worn his brown pants.

1:27:09.457 --> 1:27:10.657
You were right,
beautiful.

1:27:11.492 --> 1:27:13.360
Red really is my color.

1:27:13.861 --> 1:27:14.995
Wade?

1:27:14.997 --> 1:27:16.463
Don't worry, baby...

1:27:16.465 --> 1:27:18.865
I'mma get you out
of that shit-box.

1:27:18.867 --> 1:27:21.301
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours?

1:27:21.303 --> 1:27:23.237
Oh, you never left.

1:27:23.239 --> 1:27:25.372
But you did, asshole!

1:27:25.374 --> 1:27:26.807
Ah, deep breath, darling.

1:27:28.376 --> 1:27:29.543
Oh, wait.

1:27:30.578 --> 1:27:32.279
Wrong choice of words.

1:27:33.315 --> 1:27:37.317
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1:27:37.319 --> 1:27:38.452
'Cause i'mma go lookin'!

1:27:39.721 --> 1:27:42.356
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

1:27:42.358 --> 1:27:43.457
When I'm finished...

1:27:43.459 --> 1:27:45.359
Parts will have
to grow back you.

1:27:45.361 --> 1:27:46.526
Good one.

1:27:47.395 --> 1:27:49.329
Yep, that was a good one.

1:27:49.331 --> 1:27:50.397
Let's dance.

1:27:51.633 --> 1:27:52.866
And by dance, I mean...

1:27:52.868 --> 1:27:54.501
Let's try to kill each other.

1:28:48.690 --> 1:28:51.091
Fine. Fists.

1:28:51.093 --> 1:28:53.327
Oh, sounds like
your last Saturday night.

1:30:14.909 --> 1:30:17.010
Asshole!

1:31:13.234 --> 1:31:14.835
Hang in there,
baby!

1:31:14.837 --> 1:31:16.903
Wade!
I gotcha!

1:31:20.141 --> 1:31:22.609
I got a plan.
You're not gonna like it.

1:31:32.854 --> 1:31:34.020
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1:31:39.894 --> 1:31:42.562
Don't worry.
I'm totally on top of this.

1:31:57.645 --> 1:31:59.679
Ah! Damn it!

1:32:00.515 --> 1:32:03.517
Maximum effort!

1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:46.826
Thanks.

1:32:51.766 --> 1:32:53.300
Just take it slow.

1:33:00.007 --> 1:33:01.575
Yoo-hoo!

1:33:03.811 --> 1:33:06.580
Oh, my god! That was so...

1:33:37.379 --> 1:33:40.080
There are no words!

1:33:40.082 --> 1:33:43.817
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

1:33:44.385 --> 1:33:45.752
What?

1:33:47.990 --> 1:33:51.124
You stupid
fucking idiot.

1:33:51.126 --> 1:33:55.829
Did you really think
there was a cure...
For that?

1:33:57.665 --> 1:33:59.032
What?

1:33:59.034 --> 1:34:00.133
You heard me.

1:34:01.902 --> 1:34:03.069
No.

1:34:03.071 --> 1:34:04.304
No!

1:34:11.646 --> 1:34:15.248
So, you mean to say...

1:34:15.250 --> 1:34:20.120
After all this,
you can't fix me?

1:34:20.122 --> 1:34:22.255
It sounds even stupider
when you say it.

1:34:22.257 --> 1:34:24.190
Like the kind of stupid
who admits

1:34:24.192 --> 1:34:27.360
he can't do the one thing
I'm keeping him alive for?

1:34:31.232 --> 1:34:33.099
Any last words?

1:34:34.935 --> 1:34:36.069
What's my name?

1:34:37.104 --> 1:34:38.238
Who fucking cares?

1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:39.305
Wade!

1:34:40.941 --> 1:34:43.810
Four or five moments.

1:34:43.812 --> 1:34:43.812
I'm sorry?

1:34:43.812 --> 1:34:47.280
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1:34:47.915 --> 1:34:48.982
To?

1:34:49.884 --> 1:34:51.217
Be a hero.

1:34:53.255 --> 1:34:56.156
Everyone thinks
it's a full-time job.

1:34:56.158 --> 1:34:58.458
Wake up a hero,
brush your teeth a hero,

1:34:58.460 --> 1:34:59.893
go to work a hero.

1:35:00.227 --> 1:35:02.128
Not true.

1:35:02.130 --> 1:35:05.331
Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

1:35:05.333 --> 1:35:07.967
that really matter.

1:35:07.969 --> 1:35:10.403
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1:35:10.405 --> 1:35:13.173
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

1:35:13.175 --> 1:35:14.808
save a friend...

1:35:15.242 --> 1:35:18.411
Spare an enemy.

1:35:18.413 --> 1:35:19.979
In these moments...

1:35:20.748 --> 1:35:24.150
Everything else falls away.

1:35:24.152 --> 1:35:27.153
The way the world sees us.

1:35:27.155 --> 1:35:28.221
The way we...

1:35:32.359 --> 1:35:33.493
Why?

1:35:34.762 --> 1:35:36.830
You were droning on.

1:35:36.832 --> 1:35:39.899
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

1:35:39.901 --> 1:35:42.936
But at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1:35:42.938 --> 1:35:46.005
If wearing superhero tights...

1:35:46.007 --> 1:35:47.407
Means sparing psychopaths...

1:35:47.409 --> 1:35:49.776
Then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

1:35:49.778 --> 1:35:52.112
Not everyone monitors
a hall like you.

1:35:52.114 --> 1:35:53.213
Just promise...

1:35:53.215 --> 1:35:54.948
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be on the lookout

1:35:54.950 --> 1:35:57.183
for the next four moments.

1:35:57.185 --> 1:35:58.918
Oh, shit.

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:02.522
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just a boy,

1:36:02.524 --> 1:36:04.924
about to stand
in front of a girl...

1:36:04.926 --> 1:36:06.226
And tell her...

1:36:06.228 --> 1:36:08.294
What the fuck
am I gonna tell her?

1:36:08.296 --> 1:36:11.765
Well, hmm,
you better figure it out.

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:14.367
I can't even tell you...

1:36:14.369 --> 1:36:16.236
I deserved that.
That, too.

1:36:16.238 --> 1:36:18.004
No, no, no,
maybe not the nethers.

1:36:18.006 --> 1:36:19.973
Start talking!

1:36:21.942 --> 1:36:23.810
I'm sorry.

1:36:23.812 --> 1:36:26.045
I'm so sorry.

1:36:26.047 --> 1:36:28.548
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1:36:30.084 --> 1:36:32.185
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1:36:32.187 --> 1:36:34.020
It's been rough
couple of years.

1:36:34.022 --> 1:36:35.088
Rough?

1:36:42.863 --> 1:36:44.798
I live in a crackhouse.

1:36:45.933 --> 1:36:47.267
With a family of 12.

1:36:49.003 --> 1:36:50.470
Every night
we spoon for warmth.

1:36:50.472 --> 1:36:53.540
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1:36:53.542 --> 1:36:55.308
There's nothing
that we don't share.

1:36:55.310 --> 1:36:59.512
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

1:37:07.521 --> 1:37:09.923
So, you live in a house.

1:37:18.532 --> 1:37:21.568
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1:37:23.070 --> 1:37:24.404
But, baby,
the guy under this mask,

1:37:24.406 --> 1:37:27.106
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1:37:31.345 --> 1:37:32.579
You mean this mask?

1:37:52.633 --> 1:37:54.367
And this one.

1:37:55.870 --> 1:37:57.570
In case the other fell off.

1:38:00.474 --> 1:38:02.942
All right.
Yeah, just... ow.

1:38:02.944 --> 1:38:04.544
Like a band-aid,
just give it a...

1:38:04.546 --> 1:38:06.880
Owdie 5,000.

1:38:06.882 --> 1:38:08.014
Wait, wait, wait...

1:38:09.884 --> 1:38:11.150
Are you sure?

1:38:12.987 --> 1:38:14.053
I'm sure.

1:38:24.265 --> 1:38:25.331
Wow.

1:38:26.567 --> 1:38:27.934
Yeah.

1:38:34.608 --> 1:38:36.142
Hey.

1:38:38.279 --> 1:38:40.513
After a brief
adjustment period...

1:38:40.515 --> 1:38:42.515
And a bunch of drinks...

1:38:43.984 --> 1:38:46.019
It's a face...

1:38:50.324 --> 1:38:52.091
I'd be happy to sit on.

1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:03.036
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1:39:03.038 --> 1:39:04.470
No.

1:39:04.472 --> 1:39:06.472
Super-penis.

1:39:06.474 --> 1:39:08.574
Come on, Wade. Language.

1:39:08.576 --> 1:39:10.143
Young one is present.

1:39:11.145 --> 1:39:13.079
What are you still doing?

1:39:13.081 --> 1:39:15.682
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

1:39:15.684 --> 1:39:18.551
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1:39:18.553 --> 1:39:20.386
Tell beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1:39:20.388 --> 1:39:22.355
And you,
chicken noodle...

1:39:22.357 --> 1:39:24.257
Nothing compares to you.

1:39:24.259 --> 1:39:26.359
Sinead o'Connor, 1990.
Sorry.

1:39:26.361 --> 1:39:29.195
That's all right.
You're cool.

1:39:31.065 --> 1:39:32.665
What in the ass?

1:39:32.667 --> 1:39:36.235
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

1:39:36.237 --> 1:39:39.405
We will make an x-man
of you yet, Wade.

1:39:39.407 --> 1:39:40.707
For a second there,

1:39:40.709 --> 1:39:42.542
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

1:39:42.544 --> 1:39:44.978
Coming together to form
one super robot.

1:39:45.612 --> 1:39:47.013
There's a stupid.

1:39:47.015 --> 1:39:48.114
Yeah.

1:39:51.418 --> 1:39:55.989
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1:39:59.526 --> 1:40:00.693
Come here.

1:40:10.538 --> 1:40:13.573
Wham! As promised.

1:40:26.553 --> 1:40:28.154
<i> See?</i>

1:40:28.156 --> 1:40:31.424
<i> You don't need to be</i>
<i> a superhero to get the girl.</i>

1:40:31.426 --> 1:40:34.727
<i> The right girl will bring out</i>
<i> the hero in you.</i>

1:40:34.729 --> 1:40:38.364
<i> Now, let's finish this</i>
<i> epic wide shot. Pull out.</i>

1:40:38.366 --> 1:40:40.066
<i> There we go, that looks nice.</i>

1:40:40.068 --> 1:40:41.200
<i> That's gonna be</i>
<i> about the only thing</i>

1:40:41.202 --> 1:40:42.502
<i> that's pulling out tonight.</i>

1:40:42.504 --> 1:40:45.738
<i> Who doesn't love</i>
<i> a happy ending, huh?</i>

1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:47.407
<i> 'Til next time, this is</i>

1:40:47.409 --> 1:40:49.642
<i> your friendly neighborhood</i>
<i> pool guy singin'...</i>

1:46:50.937 --> 1:46:54.006
Captioned by deluxe

1:47:05.519 --> 1:47:07.086
you're still here?

1:47:09.689 --> 1:47:12.792
It's over. Go home.

1:47:14.494 --> 1:47:16.962
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for <i> deadpool 2.</i>

1:47:16.964 --> 1:47:19.799
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1:47:19.801 --> 1:47:22.835
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1:47:22.837 --> 1:47:25.604
With an eye patch and a saucy
little leather number?

1:47:25.606 --> 1:47:27.173
Go. Go.

1:47:32.512 --> 1:47:32.513
Oh.

1:47:32.513 --> 1:47:36.048
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1:47:36.050 --> 1:47:39.218
For the sequel,
we're gonna have cable.

1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:41.787
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1:47:41.789 --> 1:47:42.955
We have no idea
who we're gonna cast yet,

1:47:42.957 --> 1:47:44.089
but it could be anybody.

1:47:44.091 --> 1:47:45.724
Just need a big guy
with a flat top.

1:47:45.726 --> 1:47:47.526
Could be Mel Gibson,
dolph lundgren...

1:47:47.528 --> 1:47:49.962
Keira knightley.
She's got range. Who knows.

1:47:49.964 --> 1:47:51.530
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

1:47:51.532 --> 1:47:53.566
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

1:47:53.568 --> 1:47:55.968
It's a total dick move.

1:47:56.870 --> 1:47:58.003
Go.
