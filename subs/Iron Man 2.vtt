WEBVTT

00:24.340 --> 00:26.670
Been a while since I was up here in front of you.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.840
Maybe I'll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards.

00:32.930 --> 00:35.600
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred

00:35.680 --> 00:37.100
on the freeway and the rooftop...

00:37.180 --> 00:40.230
Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that

00:40.310 --> 00:43.900
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

00:43.980 --> 00:46.690
despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?

00:46.780 --> 00:47.900
Yes.

00:47.990 --> 00:52.660
And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped

00:52.740 --> 00:56.160
with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle...

00:56.250 --> 00:58.210
I know that it's confusing.

00:58.290 --> 01:01.830
It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely

01:01.920 --> 01:05.130
to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

01:08.130 --> 01:11.430
I mean, let's face it, I'm not the heroic type.

01:11.510 --> 01:13.720
A laundry list of character defects,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.640
all the mistakes I've made, largely public.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.350
The truth is

01:23.310 --> 01:25.270
I am Iron Man.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.240
Ivan.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.830
Vanya.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.270
270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15,000 feet.

05:23.350 --> 05:26.690
You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone.

07:21.010 --> 07:25.180
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

07:25.720 --> 07:27.600
It's good to be back.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.270
- You missed me?  - Blow something up!

07:31.350 --> 07:35.520
I missed you, too. Blow something up? I already did that.

07:35.610 --> 07:38.860
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

07:38.940 --> 07:43.120
its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.830
I'm not saying that from the ashes of captivity,

07:52.460 --> 07:56.960
never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history.

08:00.050 --> 08:05.970
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair,

08:06.060 --> 08:07.680
sipping on an iced tea

08:07.770 --> 08:10.810
because I haven't come across anyone who's man enough

08:10.890 --> 08:13.770
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

08:18.150 --> 08:19.400
I love you, Tony!

08:19.490 --> 08:21.610
Please, it's not about me.

08:22.990 --> 08:24.780
It's not about you.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.040
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

08:30.870 --> 08:33.870
It's about what we choose to leave behind for future generations.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.090
And that's why for the next year and for the first time since 1974,

08:38.170 --> 08:40.590
the best and brightest men and women

08:40.670 --> 08:42.630
of nations and corporations the world over

08:42.720 --> 08:46.220
will pool their resources, share their collective vision,

08:46.300 --> 08:49.350
to leave behind a brighter future.

08:49.430 --> 08:51.180
It's not about us.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.230
Therefore, what I'm saying, if I'm saying anything,

08:55.310 --> 08:57.860
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

09:01.610 --> 09:04.280
And now, making a special guest appearance

09:04.360 --> 09:06.780
from the great beyond to tell you what it's all about,

09:06.870 --> 09:09.370
please welcome my father, Howard.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.670
Everything is achievable through technology.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.040
Better living, robust health,

09:17.540 --> 09:22.090
and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.090
So, from all of us here at Stark Industries,

09:24.170 --> 09:28.970
I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future.

09:29.050 --> 09:32.810
Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind,

09:32.890 --> 09:35.730
and will one day rid society of all its ills.

09:35.810 --> 09:39.400
Soon, technology will affect the way you live your life every day.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.070
No more tedious work,

09:41.360 --> 09:45.780
leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life.

09:45.860 --> 09:48.620
The Stark Expo. Welcome.

09:53.790 --> 09:56.710
We are coming to you live from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

09:56.790 --> 09:59.670
where Tony Stark has just walked offstage.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.340
Don't worry if you can't make it down here tonight

10:01.420 --> 10:03.840
because this Expo goes on all year long.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.920
And I'm gonna be here checking out all the attractions

10:06.010 --> 10:09.550
and the pavilions and the inventions from all around the world.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.100
- Make sure you join me...  - All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

10:12.180 --> 10:15.020
- Open up, let's go.  - Hey! Nice to see you.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.640
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.  - Tony, Tony...

10:17.730 --> 10:19.270
Hey, hey...

10:19.350 --> 10:21.820
- Call me.  - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.360
Hello. it would be a pleasure.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.940
- Okay.  - See you, buddy.

10:26.030 --> 10:27.110
This is Larry.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.280
Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.870
- Nice to see you.  - Call me. Call me.

10:30.950 --> 10:32.740
- Larry King...  - Larry!

10:33.200 --> 10:35.580
Yes, my people, my people...

10:35.660 --> 10:37.210
Come on, Tony. There we go.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.170
- Very mellow.  - That wasn't so bad.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.540
No, it was perfect.

10:40.630 --> 10:42.130
Look what we got here, the new model.

10:42.210 --> 10:43.920
- Hey, does she come with the car?  - I certainly hope so.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.090
- Hi.  - Hi.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.340
- And you are?  - Marshal.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.340
- Irish. I like it.  - Pleased to meet you, Tony.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.590
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?

10:50.720 --> 10:51.930
- Bedford.  - What are you doing here?

10:52.050 --> 10:54.770
- Looking for you.  - Yeah? You found me.

10:56.230 --> 10:59.310
- What are you up to later?  - Serving subpoenas.

11:01.770 --> 11:02.940
He doesn't like to be handed things.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.610
- Yeah, I have a peeve.  - I got it.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.820
You are hereby ordered

11:05.940 --> 11:08.150
to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee

11:08.280 --> 11:09.910
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

11:09.990 --> 11:11.570
- Can I see a badge?  - You wanna see the badge?

11:11.660 --> 11:13.950
He likes the badge.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.120
- You still like it?  - Yep.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.630
- How far are we from D.C.?  - D.C.? 250 miles.

11:24.380 --> 11:30.260
Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

11:30.340 --> 11:31.930
- Yes, dear?  - Can I have your attention?

11:32.010 --> 11:33.100
Absolutely.

11:33.180 --> 11:36.140
Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?

11:36.270 --> 11:38.520
- I do not. I do not.  - You do not?

11:38.640 --> 11:41.100
Well, it depends on how you define the word "weapon".

11:41.190 --> 11:43.860
- The Iron Man weapon.  - My device does not fit that description.

11:43.980 --> 11:45.650
Well... How would you describe it?

11:45.770 --> 11:48.780
I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.660
- As?  - It's a high-tech prosthesis.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.780
That is... That is...

11:53.870 --> 11:56.160
That's actually the most apt description I can make of it.

11:56.290 --> 11:58.120
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.290
Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen...

12:01.370 --> 12:04.250
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people

12:04.330 --> 12:07.710
- of the United States of America.  - Well, you can forget it.

12:08.300 --> 12:12.050
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

12:12.180 --> 12:14.590
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself,

12:14.680 --> 12:17.680
which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution,

12:17.810 --> 12:19.430
depending on what state you're in.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.480
- You can't have it.  - Look, I'm no expert...

12:22.560 --> 12:26.360
In prostitution? Of course not. You're a senator. Come on.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.780
I'm no expert in weapons.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.700
We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.

12:31.820 --> 12:36.530
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.

12:37.530 --> 12:41.040
Let the record reflect that I observed Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

12:41.160 --> 12:42.460
and I am wondering

12:42.540 --> 12:46.340
if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.

12:50.210 --> 12:54.550
Absolutely. I'm no expert. I defer to you, Anthony.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.640
You're the wonder boy.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.850
Senator, if I may.

12:58.930 --> 13:03.390
I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert?

13:03.520 --> 13:06.100
Your dad. Howard Stark.

13:06.230 --> 13:10.610
Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age.

13:11.230 --> 13:15.740
Let's just be clear. He was no flower child. He was a lion.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.240
We all know why we're here. In the last six months,

13:18.370 --> 13:22.450
Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.370
And yet he insists it's a shield.

13:25.460 --> 13:30.090
He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.420
I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do.

13:33.550 --> 13:36.640
I'd love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house,

13:36.760 --> 13:38.180
but this ain't Canada.

13:38.260 --> 13:39.930
You know, we live in a world of grave threats,

13:40.060 --> 13:43.770
threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.270
Thank you.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.110
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.320
That is well said, Mr Hammer.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.360
The committee would now like to invite

13:54.440 --> 13:57.570
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.

13:57.660 --> 13:59.160
Rhodey? What?

14:05.500 --> 14:08.750
Hey, buddy. I didn't expect to see you here.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.460
Look, it's me, I'm here. Deal with it. Let's move on.

14:11.590 --> 14:12.630
I just...

14:12.750 --> 14:14.130
- Drop it.  - All right, I'll drop it.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.720
I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon,

14:17.800 --> 14:20.470
compiled by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record,

14:20.600 --> 14:23.680
can you please read page 57, paragraph four?

14:23.810 --> 14:26.060
You're requesting that I read specific selections

14:26.140 --> 14:27.440
- from my report, Senator?  - Yes, sir.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.440
It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying

14:29.520 --> 14:31.690
in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.400
I understand. A lot of things have changed today.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.780
- So if you could just read...  - You do understand

14:34.860 --> 14:37.280
that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect

14:37.360 --> 14:38.660
the summary of my final...

14:38.660 --> 14:40.660
Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.120
Very well.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.330
"As he does not operate within any definable branch of government,

14:50.330 --> 14:54.420
Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation

14:54.500 --> 14:55.920
and to her interests."

14:56.010 --> 14:57.880
I did, however, go on to summarise

14:58.010 --> 15:00.680
that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.930
- And that it would be in our interest...  - That's enough, Colonel.

15:03.010 --> 15:04.180
- To fold Mr Stark...  - That's enough.

15:04.310 --> 15:05.810
Into the existing chain of command, Senator.

15:05.890 --> 15:06.570
I'm not a joiner,

15:06.570 --> 15:09.270
but I'll consider Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

15:09.350 --> 15:12.020
We can amend the hours a little bit.

15:12.690 --> 15:14.440
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,

15:14.520 --> 15:16.690
the imagery that's connected to your report.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.650
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images

15:19.740 --> 15:21.530
- to the general public at this time.  - With all due respect,

15:21.660 --> 15:22.820
Colonel, I understand.

15:22.910 --> 15:27.000
And if you could just narrate those for us, we'd be very grateful.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.040
Let's have the images.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.710
Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos

15:33.840 --> 15:36.670
are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies

15:36.760 --> 15:38.220
of Mr Stark's suit.

15:38.340 --> 15:43.350
This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground,

15:43.430 --> 15:48.560
indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.

15:48.980 --> 15:52.650
Hold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.

15:53.230 --> 15:56.230
Boy, I'm good. I commandeered your screens.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.740
I need them. Time for a little transparency.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.740
- Now, let's see what's really going on.  - What is he doing?

16:01.820 --> 16:05.070
If you will direct your attention to said screens...

16:05.160 --> 16:06.740
I believe that's North Korea.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.840
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.090
Iran.

16:22.590 --> 16:26.600
No grave immediate threat here. Is that Justin Hammer?

16:27.260 --> 16:29.140
How did Hammer get in the game?

16:29.930 --> 16:31.850
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.530
Okay, give me a left twist. Left's good. Turn to the right.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.660
Oh, Shit. Oh, Shit!

16:41.740 --> 16:42.910
Wow.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.660
Yeah, I'd say most countries, five, 10 years away.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.040
Hammer Industries, 20.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.750
I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.

16:51.870 --> 16:53.380
I think we're done, is the point that he's making.

16:53.460 --> 16:56.670
- I don't think there's any reason...  - The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.590
- For what?  - Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.220
It's working. We're safe. America is secure.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.220
You want my property? You can't have it.

17:04.300 --> 17:05.720
But I did you a big favour.

17:06.470 --> 17:09.390
I've successfully privatized world peace.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.770
What more do you want? For now!

17:15.820 --> 17:18.440
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.900
F**k you, Mr Stark. F**k you, buddy.

17:22.150 --> 17:24.120
We're adjourned. We're adjourned for today.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.490
- Okay.  - You've been a delight.

17:32.330 --> 17:34.580
My bond is with the people.

17:34.670 --> 17:39.920
And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.590
If there's one thing I've proven

17:41.670 --> 17:45.010
it's that you can count on me to pleasure myself.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.210
Wake up. Daddy's home.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.880
Welcome home, sir.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.840
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.

18:25.970 --> 18:28.970
They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.810
And may I say how refreshing it is

18:30.890 --> 18:34.640
to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.690
You!

18:38.310 --> 18:40.480
I swear to God I'll dismantle you. I'll soak your motherboard.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.150
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.910
How many ounces a day of this gobbledegook

18:45.990 --> 18:47.070
am I supposed to drink?

18:47.160 --> 18:51.160
We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
Check palladium levels.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.330
Blood toxicity, 24%.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.170
It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit

19:02.250 --> 19:04.670
is accelerating your condition.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.550
Another core has been depleted.

19:12.010 --> 19:13.600
God, they're running out quick.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.350
I have run simulations on every known element,

19:16.440 --> 19:18.480
and none can serve as a viable replacement

19:18.560 --> 19:20.560
for the palladium core.

19:22.780 --> 19:25.860
You are running out of both time and options.

19:29.570 --> 19:32.280
Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive

19:32.370 --> 19:34.200
is also killing you.

19:35.710 --> 19:37.120
Miss Potts is approaching.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.130
- I recommend that you inform her...  - Mute.

19:43.210 --> 19:44.800
Is this a joke?

19:46.220 --> 19:47.880
- What are you thinking?  - What?

19:47.970 --> 19:50.260
- What are you thinking?  - Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.680
And you're angry about something.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.140
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.640
- Did you just donate...  - Keep your business.

19:55.730 --> 19:59.270
our entire modern art collection to the...

19:59.400 --> 20:00.980
- Boy Scouts of America.  - Boy Scouts of America?

20:01.060 --> 20:02.860
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

20:02.940 --> 20:06.320
I didn't physically check the crates but, basically, yes.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.570
And it's not "our" collection, it's my collection. No offence.

20:08.650 --> 20:10.700
No, you know what? I think I'm actually entitled

20:10.780 --> 20:12.370
to say "our" collection

20:12.450 --> 20:15.660
considering the time that I put in, over 10 years,

20:15.750 --> 20:17.580
- curating that.  - It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

20:17.660 --> 20:20.750
You know, there's only about 8,011 things

20:20.830 --> 20:22.790
that I really need to talk to you about.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.340
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.880
The Bridgeport's already machining that part.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.340
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.680
I need you to wear a surgical mask until you're feeling better.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.800
- Is that okay?  - That's rude.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.390
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.

20:33.470 --> 20:34.810
It's my primary point of concern.

20:34.930 --> 20:38.060
- I don't know why you're...  - The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.940
Wow. Look at that.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.520
That's modern art. That's going up.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.360
- You've got to be kidding.  - I'm gonna put this up right now.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.650
- This is vital.  - Stark is in complete disarray.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.070
- You understand that?  - No. Our stocks have never been higher.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.490
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.  - You are... Well, if it's messy,

20:53.570 --> 20:55.080
- then let's double back.  - Let me give you an example.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.740
- Let's move on to another subject.  - No, no, no, no.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.540
You are not taking down the Barnett Newman

20:58.620 --> 21:00.120
- and hanging that up!  - I'm not taking it down.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.460
I'm just replacing it with this.

21:01.540 --> 21:02.920
- Let's see what I can get going here.  - Okay, fine.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.130
My point is, we have already awarded contracts

21:06.210 --> 21:07.880
- to the wind farm people.  - Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

21:07.960 --> 21:10.050
- I'm already feeling gassy.  - And to the plastic plantation tree,

21:10.130 --> 21:12.260
which was your idea, by the way. Those people are on payroll...

21:12.340 --> 21:14.140
- Everything was my idea.  - And you won't make a decision.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.930
I don't care about the liberal agenda any more.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.390
It's boring. Boring. I'm giving you a boring alert.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.770
- You do it.  - I do what?

21:20.850 --> 21:22.810
Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.690
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.  - Pepper, I need you to run the company.

21:25.770 --> 21:27.190
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.  - You will not

21:27.270 --> 21:28.940
- give me the information...  - I'm not asking you to try...

21:29.030 --> 21:30.150
- In order to...  - I'm asking you

21:30.240 --> 21:31.450
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

21:31.530 --> 21:33.280
- I am trying to do it.  - Pepper, you're not listening to me!

21:33.360 --> 21:35.280
- No, you are not listening to me.  - I'm trying to make you CEO.

21:35.370 --> 21:37.240
Why won't you let me?

21:37.790 --> 21:40.790
- Have you been drinking?  - Chlorophyll.

21:42.710 --> 21:46.960
I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

21:47.040 --> 21:48.960
effective immediately.

21:51.130 --> 21:53.050
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

21:54.510 --> 21:57.100
I've actually given this a fair amount of thought,

21:57.180 --> 22:01.100
believe it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

22:01.350 --> 22:05.060
trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be.

22:05.150 --> 22:06.940
And then I realised

22:09.480 --> 22:12.030
it's you. It's always been you.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.160
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

22:15.240 --> 22:18.700
but actually I'm capable of appointing my successor.

22:19.410 --> 22:21.410
My successor being you.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.250
Congratulations?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.590
- Take it, just take it.  - I don't know what to think.

22:28.670 --> 22:30.460
Don't think. Drink.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.300
There you go.

23:17.370 --> 23:20.620
The notary's here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?

23:21.160 --> 23:22.910
I'm on happy time.

23:29.130 --> 23:30.380
- Sorry.  - What the hell was that?

23:30.460 --> 23:32.880
It's called mixed martial arts. It's been around for three weeks.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.050
It's called dirty boxing. There's nothing new about it.

23:35.130 --> 23:37.590
All right, put them up. Come on.

23:40.260 --> 23:45.140
I promise you this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.730
I need you to initial each box.

23:49.310 --> 23:52.070
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

23:54.360 --> 23:55.570
That's it. I'm done.

23:55.650 --> 23:58.070
- What's your name, lady?  - Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.740
Front and centre. Come into the church.

23:59.820 --> 24:03.620
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...  - If it pleases the court, which it does.

24:03.700 --> 24:07.040
- It's no problem.  - I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.760
What?

24:25.520 --> 24:28.310
- Can you give her a lesson?  - No problem.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.400
- Pepper.  - What?

24:31.650 --> 24:33.900
- Who is she?  - She is from legal.

24:33.980 --> 24:38.070
And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

24:38.150 --> 24:40.320
- if you keep ogling her like that.  - I need a new assistant, boss.

24:40.410 --> 24:43.200
Yes, and I've got three excellent potential candidates.

24:43.330 --> 24:44.830
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.790
I don't have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

24:47.870 --> 24:48.960
No, it's not.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.830
- You ever boxed before?  - I have,yes.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.880
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

24:54.960 --> 24:58.720
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?  - R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

24:58.800 --> 25:03.220
- What, are you gonna Google her now?  - I thought I was ogling her.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.980
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.  - You're so predictable, you know that?

25:07.060 --> 25:09.230
She's fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin.

25:09.310 --> 25:11.190
- Who speaks Latin?  - No one speaks Latin.

25:11.270 --> 25:13.560
- No one speaks Latin?  - It's a dead language.

25:13.650 --> 25:15.440
You can read Latin or you can write Latin,

25:15.530 --> 25:17.110
- but you can't speak Latin...  - Did you model in Tokyo?

25:17.190 --> 25:18.950
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.  - Well...

25:19.030 --> 25:20.410
I need her. She's got everything that I need.

25:20.490 --> 25:24.120
Rule number one, never take your eye off your opponent.

25:25.330 --> 25:26.740
Oh, my God!

25:29.000 --> 25:31.750
- Happy!  - That's what I'm talking about.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.170
- I just slipped.  - You did?

25:33.250 --> 25:35.590
- Yeah.  - Looks like a TKO to me.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.130
Just... I need your impression.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.930
You have a quiet reserve. I don't know, you have an old soul.

25:43.010 --> 25:45.510
- I meant your fingerprint.  - Right.

25:48.350 --> 25:51.890
- So, how are we doing?  - Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

25:53.150 --> 25:56.360
- You're the boss.  - Will that be all, Mr Stark?

25:56.440 --> 25:58.400
- No.  - Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.320
Thank you very much.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.990
- I want one.  - No.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.280
You know, it's Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

26:41.360 --> 26:42.610
- just go with it.  - Go with it? Go with what?

26:42.700 --> 26:44.240
- Mr Stark?  - Hey.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.530
Hello. How was your flight?

26:45.620 --> 26:47.120
It was excellent. Boy, it's nice to see you.

26:47.200 --> 26:51.370
We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

26:51.450 --> 26:53.540
- When did this happen?  - What? You made me do it.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.170
- I made you do what?  - You quit. Smile. Look right there.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.380
Stop acting constipated.

26:57.460 --> 26:58.920
- Don't flare your nostrils.  - You are so predictable.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.050
- That's the amazing thing.  - Right this way.

27:00.130 --> 27:01.840
- You look fantastic.  - Why, thank you very much.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.760
But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?

27:03.840 --> 27:05.760
You have a 9:30 dinner.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.600
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.  - Absolutely.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.510
- Is this us?  - It can be.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.270
- Great. Make it us.  - Okay.

27:11.350 --> 27:13.810
- Mr Musk. How are you?  - Hi, Pepper.

27:13.890 --> 27:15.770
- Congratulations on the promotion.  - Thank you very much.

27:15.850 --> 27:18.110
Elon, how's it going? Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

27:18.190 --> 27:20.190
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea for an electric jet.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.360
- You do?  - Yeah.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.490
Then we'll make it work.

27:23.860 --> 27:25.320
- You want a massage?  - Oh, God. No,

27:25.410 --> 27:26.860
- I don't want a massage.  - I'll have Natalie make an...

27:26.950 --> 27:28.370
- I don't want Natalie to do...  - Don't want you tense.

27:28.450 --> 27:29.620
By the way, I didn't mean to spring this on you.

27:29.700 --> 27:30.830
Thank you very much.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.870
- Green is not your best colour.  - Oh, please.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.500
Anthony! Is that you?

27:34.580 --> 27:35.870
- My least favourite person on Earth.  - Hey, pal.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.250
- Justin Hammer.  - How you doing?

27:37.330 --> 27:40.130
You're not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.630
You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair.

27:42.710 --> 27:43.840
- You guys know each other?  - Hi.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.170
- Yes.  - Yes.

27:45.260 --> 27:46.430
- Yes, roughly.  - We do.

27:46.510 --> 27:50.560
BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.930
- I know. I know.  - Congratulations.

27:52.010 --> 27:55.480
My editor will kill me if I don't grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.730
- Can I?  - Sure.

27:56.810 --> 27:59.310
She's actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.320
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.480
- Right.  - Right?

28:02.570 --> 28:05.950
Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.

28:06.030 --> 28:07.360
And she wrote a story as well.

28:07.450 --> 28:09.490
- It was very impressive.  - That was good.

28:09.570 --> 28:11.620
- Very well done.  - Thank you.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.160
- I'm gonna go wash.  - Don't leave me.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.700
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?  - I'm all right.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.080
- Looking gorgeous.  - Please, this is tough.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.790
- Can I ask you... Is this the first time...  - Fromage.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.380
- Say, "Brie."  - That you guys have seen each other?

28:20.460 --> 28:22.710
God, that's so awful.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.170
Listen, is it the first time you've seen each other since the Senate?

28:25.260 --> 28:26.920
Since he got his contract revoked...

28:27.010 --> 28:29.220
- Actually, it's on hold.  - When you were attempting to...

28:29.300 --> 28:31.300
That's not what I heard. What's the difference between "hold"

28:31.390 --> 28:33.220
- and "cancelled"? The truth?  - Yes, what is?

28:33.310 --> 28:35.680
No. The truth is... Why don't we put that away?

28:35.770 --> 28:39.770
The truth is, I'm actually hoping to present something at your Expo.

28:39.850 --> 28:42.230
Well, if you invent something that works,

28:42.320 --> 28:43.730
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.030
- Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.  - Yes?

28:46.110 --> 28:48.320
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.570
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.  - We kid, yeah.

28:52.450 --> 28:53.620
We kid. We're kidders.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.020
Got any other bad ideas?

29:22.230 --> 29:23.400
Tony!

29:27.240 --> 29:29.500
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.530
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

29:31.610 --> 29:34.080
Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities

29:34.160 --> 29:36.660
for Hammer Industries, you know?

29:36.740 --> 29:40.080
- Everything that Tony and I do...  - Well, what's the use of having...

29:40.160 --> 29:43.040
- Is a healthy...  - And owning a race car...

29:43.130 --> 29:46.090
- Competition.  - If you don't drive it?

29:47.130 --> 29:48.670
Is he driving?

29:55.930 --> 29:57.640
Natalie. Natalie!

29:58.560 --> 29:59.770
- Yes, Miss Potts?  - Did you know about this?

29:59.850 --> 30:02.060
This is the first that I have known of it.

30:02.730 --> 30:03.900
This... This cannot happen.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.650
Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?

30:05.730 --> 30:06.980
- Where's Happy?  - He's waiting outside.

30:07.070 --> 30:08.940
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.  - Right away.

30:09.690 --> 30:11.820
Tony's... You know, he...

30:11.900 --> 30:13.780
We're not competitive. You know what I mean?

30:13.860 --> 30:14.950
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

30:15.030 --> 30:17.990
- can you excuse me just one second?  - Just read me what you wrote.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.290
- I will. I will, after.  - Just read it back to me.

30:19.370 --> 30:20.620
But I have to make one quick phone call.

30:20.710 --> 30:21.790
- Where are you going?  - This is great.

30:21.870 --> 30:23.250
- I've got some caviar coming.  - This is great stuff.

30:23.330 --> 30:24.830
- I'll be right back.  - Look!

30:24.920 --> 30:26.420
That's Stark.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.660
Go, go!

32:29.250 --> 32:30.540
Hang on.

33:39.490 --> 33:41.320
- Give me the case.  - Here. Take it.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.990
- Where's the key?  - It's in my pocket.

33:43.070 --> 33:44.240
Car!

34:47.890 --> 34:49.310
Oh, my God!

34:55.900 --> 34:58.440
- Are you okay?  - Yeah.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.440
- Were you heading for me or him?  - I was trying to scare him.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.530
- 'Cause I can't tell!  - Are you out of your mind?

35:03.610 --> 35:05.570
- Better security.  - Get in the car right now!

35:05.660 --> 35:07.410
I was attacked! We need better security.

35:07.490 --> 35:09.740
- Get in the car!  - You're CEO. Better security measures.

35:09.830 --> 35:11.580
God, it's embarrassing.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.670
First vacation in two years.

35:19.340 --> 35:20.750
Oh, my God!

35:21.840 --> 35:24.090
- I got him!  - Hit him again. Hit him again.

35:24.170 --> 35:26.050
Football.

35:28.510 --> 35:30.560
- I got him!  - Take the case! Take it!

35:30.640 --> 35:32.310
- Take the case!  - Give him the case!

35:32.390 --> 35:34.230
Stop banging the car!

35:37.350 --> 35:38.730
Calm down.

35:39.650 --> 35:41.650
God! God!

35:44.240 --> 35:46.990
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

37:19.370 --> 37:21.040
You... You lose.

37:27.380 --> 37:30.000
You lose. You lose, Stark.

38:23.560 --> 38:27.230
Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.900
You could have doubled up your rotations.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.370
You focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.370
It's effective. Not very efficient.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.750
But it's a passable knock-off.

38:48.670 --> 38:49.960
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

38:50.040 --> 38:51.840
you could have made a solid paycheck.

38:51.920 --> 38:56.090
You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran,

38:56.170 --> 38:58.800
or gone right to the black market.

38:58.890 --> 39:01.850
You look like you got friends in low places.

39:01.930 --> 39:07.480
You come from a family of thieves and butchers.

39:08.850 --> 39:11.150
And now, like all guilty men,

39:12.070 --> 39:14.690
you try to rewrite your own history.

39:15.360 --> 39:20.370
And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.790
Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?

39:24.870 --> 39:27.790
My father. Anton Vanko.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.170
Well, I never heard of him.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.960
My father is the reason you're alive.

39:35.210 --> 39:37.220
The reason I'm alive is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

39:37.300 --> 39:38.840
you missed.

39:38.930 --> 39:40.130
Did I?

39:43.010 --> 39:45.140
If you can make God bleed,

39:46.140 --> 39:49.020
the people will cease to believe in him.

39:50.350 --> 39:54.690
And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come.

39:56.690 --> 40:01.110
The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch

40:01.200 --> 40:03.700
as the world will consume you.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.870
Where will you be watching the world consume me from?

40:05.950 --> 40:09.870
That's right. A prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.250
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

40:12.330 --> 40:15.710
palladium in the chest, painful way to die.

40:33.150 --> 40:36.610
It's just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle

40:36.690 --> 40:39.150
and this man has no idea what he's doing.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.990
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.

40:43.070 --> 40:47.910
I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant

40:47.990 --> 40:51.620
that these suits can't exist anywhere else,

40:51.710 --> 40:54.250
don't exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else,

40:54.330 --> 40:55.670
at least for 5 to 10 years,

40:55.750 --> 41:00.380
and here we are in Monaco realising, "These suits exist now."

41:00.470 --> 41:01.630
Mute.

41:03.930 --> 41:07.220
He should be giving me a medal. That's the truth.

41:10.770 --> 41:14.560
- What is that?  - This is your in-flight meal.

41:17.570 --> 41:19.730
Did you just make that?

41:19.820 --> 41:23.240
Yeah. Where do you think I've been for three hours?

41:24.240 --> 41:25.410
Tony,

41:27.580 --> 41:29.830
what are you not telling me?

41:33.750 --> 41:36.750
I don't want to go home. At all.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.710
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

41:41.800 --> 41:44.380
We're in Europe. Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

41:44.470 --> 41:45.680
- Remember?  - Oh, yes.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.640
It's a great place to

41:50.140 --> 41:53.270
- be healthy.  - I don't think this is the right time.

41:53.350 --> 41:55.600
We're in kind of a mess.

41:55.690 --> 41:57.310
Yeah, but maybe that's why it's the best time.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.440
- 'Cause then we...  - Well, I think as the CEO,

41:59.520 --> 42:00.650
I need to show up.

42:00.730 --> 42:05.030
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

42:05.110 --> 42:06.450
- A leave?  - A company retreat.

42:06.530 --> 42:09.080
- A retreat? During a time like this?  - Just a ride.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.750
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.580
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

44:27.550 --> 44:29.670
Hey, there he is.

44:30.380 --> 44:31.840
There he is.

44:33.760 --> 44:36.930
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

44:38.020 --> 44:39.060
Oh, goodness gracious.

44:39.180 --> 44:42.690
Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here?

44:42.770 --> 44:46.270
Forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm such a huge fan of yours.

44:46.360 --> 44:50.150
I didn't want to make a first impression like this.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.530
He's not an animal. Come on.

44:53.410 --> 44:56.080
He's a human being. Thank you.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.540
We're fine.

45:04.210 --> 45:05.880
My name is Justin Hammer.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.300
I'd like to do some business with you. Please sit.

45:13.050 --> 45:15.510
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

45:15.590 --> 45:18.930
- We have some salmon carpaccio.  - Salmon carpaccio.

45:20.390 --> 45:22.230
Anything you want here, we got it.

45:22.310 --> 45:26.400
I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.360
It's Italian, though.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.230
Organic ice cream.

45:30.320 --> 45:34.240
I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.950
What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track,

45:39.080 --> 45:42.710
how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody,

45:42.790 --> 45:44.920
that was... Wow!

45:45.000 --> 45:46.540
You spoke to me with what you did.

45:46.630 --> 45:49.250
And I know that you knew that I'd be listening.

45:49.340 --> 45:50.880
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off

45:50.960 --> 45:53.760
to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.180
But if I might make a suggestion,

45:55.260 --> 45:57.970
you know, you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

45:58.100 --> 46:02.310
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

46:02.430 --> 46:04.480
That's what you kill.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.560
You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

46:07.650 --> 46:12.280
The only difference between you and I is that I have resources.

46:13.110 --> 46:15.530
I think, if I may,

46:15.610 --> 46:17.950
you need my resources.

46:18.030 --> 46:20.620
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

46:20.700 --> 46:22.790
I'd like to be that guy.

46:34.670 --> 46:38.970
Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator.

46:39.050 --> 46:41.890
I don't know. Have you been understanding everything I'm saying?

46:41.970 --> 46:43.390
Very good, man.

46:43.470 --> 46:46.640
- Very good, man.  - Very good, man.

46:46.730 --> 46:47.850
Hey!

46:49.400 --> 46:51.570
- Hey.  - Yes?

46:51.650 --> 46:53.230
I want my bird.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.910
- A bird? You want a bird?  - I want my bird.

46:58.990 --> 47:00.660
I can get you a bird. I can get you 10 birds.

47:00.740 --> 47:02.280
I want my bird.

47:02.370 --> 47:04.910
Well, okay. Nothing's impossible. I could...

47:05.000 --> 47:08.670
Are we talking about... Is this a bird back in Russia?

47:08.750 --> 47:11.790
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong

47:11.880 --> 47:13.800
- despite the events in Monaco.  - Yes, of course.

47:13.880 --> 47:17.340
- The AP wants a quote.  - Don't tell him. Fax them...

47:17.420 --> 47:18.930
Where is he?

47:19.010 --> 47:20.800
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.  - He's downstairs.

47:20.890 --> 47:22.350
- What happened in Monaco?  - Yes, but...

47:22.430 --> 47:24.930
But his continuing erratic behaviour

47:25.020 --> 47:27.140
may lead many people to ask themselves,

47:27.230 --> 47:29.060
"Can this man still protect us?"

47:29.190 --> 47:32.440
Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.

47:33.730 --> 47:38.110
Query complete, sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist

47:38.200 --> 47:41.200
who defected to the United States in 1963.

47:41.280 --> 47:45.450
However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967.

47:45.540 --> 47:47.910
His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,

47:48.040 --> 47:52.750
was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

47:52.880 --> 47:55.340
and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.

47:55.420 --> 47:57.550
No further records exist.

48:02.090 --> 48:03.720
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

48:03.800 --> 48:06.060
and get on top of this situation right now.

48:06.140 --> 48:10.140
Listen. I've been on the phone with the National Guard all day,

48:10.480 --> 48:13.310
trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH,

48:13.400 --> 48:16.280
knocking down your front door and taking these.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.400
They're gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?

48:18.490 --> 48:20.400
They're sick of the games.

48:20.490 --> 48:23.700
You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years.

48:23.780 --> 48:26.990
Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.410
It's not theoretical any more.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.670
Are you listening to me?

48:34.790 --> 48:36.420
- Are you okay?  - Let's go.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.340
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

48:45.680 --> 48:49.060
- You all right?  - Yeah, I should get to my desk.

48:49.140 --> 48:51.270
- See that cigar box?  - Yeah.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.270
It's palladium.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.730
Is that supposed to be smoking?

49:01.820 --> 49:06.110
If you must know, it's neutron damage. It's from the reactor wall.

49:09.830 --> 49:11.950
You had this in your body?

49:16.790 --> 49:20.630
And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?

49:20.710 --> 49:22.130
Road rash.

49:25.510 --> 49:26.890
Thank you.

49:38.310 --> 49:41.820
- What are you looking at?  - I'm looking at you.

49:41.900 --> 49:44.940
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act

49:45.030 --> 49:47.070
and it's unnecessary. You don't have to do this alone.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.370
You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do.

49:49.490 --> 49:51.700
But you've gotta trust me.

49:51.830 --> 49:55.580
Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I'm doing.

50:04.340 --> 50:06.630
This is where we do it. This is my humble abode.

50:06.720 --> 50:10.180
You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right?

50:10.260 --> 50:11.680
No pressure.

50:11.760 --> 50:14.770
Here they are. I'm very excited. They're combat-ready.

50:14.850 --> 50:16.310
I may have done a few miscalculations

50:16.390 --> 50:18.390
and rushed the prototype into production.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.360
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.730
Go ahead, take a look around.

50:27.530 --> 50:29.450
You don't wanna do that.

50:29.530 --> 50:31.160
You'll be able to access that

50:31.240 --> 50:33.160
as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.330
Can we generate some encrypted pass codes?

50:35.410 --> 50:38.540
Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack.

50:39.710 --> 50:41.380
Never mind, I...

50:42.630 --> 50:45.920
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

50:48.380 --> 50:50.720
- Sorry?  - Software shit.

50:52.970 --> 50:54.220
Well...

50:55.720 --> 50:57.140
You're good.

50:57.390 --> 51:00.560
You really blasted in past the firewall there.

51:01.810 --> 51:04.690
Let me show you where you're gonna be working primarily.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.730
Go ahead, take a look.

51:07.610 --> 51:10.240
Get a good look at that. That's something, isn't it?

51:10.320 --> 51:12.320
You know, those are really just for show and tell.

51:12.410 --> 51:17.410
They're $125.7 million a pop, so... wait! Oh, gosh.

51:19.500 --> 51:22.420
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

51:23.250 --> 51:25.840
That's where the pilot goes.

51:25.920 --> 51:29.970
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

51:30.090 --> 51:33.220
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

51:33.300 --> 51:34.800
What you want them do?

51:34.930 --> 51:40.100
Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.230
I want to make Iron Man look like an antique.

51:42.310 --> 51:43.440
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

51:43.520 --> 51:45.440
I wanna take a dump in Tony's front yard.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.940
You know what I'm talking about?

51:47.030 --> 51:49.190
- I can do that. No problem.  - Yeah?

51:49.280 --> 51:51.450
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

51:51.530 --> 51:54.240
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you? I had a feeling.

52:03.830 --> 52:06.290
Do you know which watch you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

52:06.630 --> 52:08.630
I'll give them a look.

52:11.510 --> 52:12.970
I should cancel the party.

52:14.050 --> 52:15.300
- Probably.  - Yeah.

52:15.390 --> 52:18.010
-'Cause it's...  - Ill-timed.

52:18.140 --> 52:19.600
Right, sends the wrong message.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.180
Inappropriate.

52:27.020 --> 52:29.320
Is that dirty enough for you?

52:30.320 --> 52:34.070
Gold face, brown band. The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

52:34.570 --> 52:36.030
Bring them over here.

52:39.330 --> 52:41.500
I'll take that. Why don't you...

52:53.550 --> 52:55.890
I gotta say it. It's hard to get a read on you.

52:56.180 --> 52:58.350
- Where are you from?  - Legal.

53:01.060 --> 53:03.180
Can I ask you a question, hypothetically?

53:03.270 --> 53:04.560
Bit Odd.

53:04.850 --> 53:08.230
If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have,

53:08.360 --> 53:09.900
how would you celebrate it?

53:12.570 --> 53:16.740
I'd do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.440
Yes, sir, I understand.

53:53.070 --> 53:56.780
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I'll handle it.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.200
Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours,

53:59.280 --> 54:01.120
Iron Man will be back on watch.

54:08.420 --> 54:09.920
Hey, Pepper.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.340
I'm going to go get some air.

54:12.420 --> 54:13.800
What's wrong?

54:14.590 --> 54:16.920
- I don't know what to do.  - You gotta be kidding me.

54:23.100 --> 54:25.730
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.  - No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

54:25.810 --> 54:27.730
This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

54:27.810 --> 54:29.060
I know. I know. I get it.

54:29.150 --> 54:30.400
I'm gonna handle it, okay? Just let me handle it.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.440
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

54:34.610 --> 54:36.280
You know, the question I get asked most often is,

54:36.360 --> 54:38.860
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?"

54:42.280 --> 54:43.700
Just like that.

54:47.330 --> 54:50.290
Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?

54:53.960 --> 54:55.000
I love you.

54:55.130 --> 54:57.760
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

54:57.840 --> 55:01.800
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night.

55:01.890 --> 55:05.890
And we're gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.

55:05.970 --> 55:07.180
No, no, no, we can't... wait, wait, wait.

55:07.310 --> 55:09.060
We didn't have the cake. We didn't blow out the candles.

55:09.140 --> 55:11.940
You're out of control, okay? Trust me on this one, okay?

55:12.020 --> 55:14.360
- You're out of control, gorgeous.  - It's time to go to bed. It's time.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.570
- Give me another smooch.  - You're not going to be

55:15.650 --> 55:16.860
- happy about this.  - Come on, you know you want to.

55:16.980 --> 55:18.320
You just peed the suit.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.860
- I know. It has a filtration system.  - It's not sexy.

55:19.990 --> 55:21.360
You could drink that water.

55:21.820 --> 55:25.030
Just send everybody home, okay? It's time to...

55:25.160 --> 55:26.870
- If you say so.  - Okay.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.160
I'll take this, you take that.

55:30.540 --> 55:32.170
Pepper Potts.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.000
She's right. The party's over.

55:35.090 --> 55:38.050
Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago.

55:38.170 --> 55:41.680
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.

55:45.220 --> 55:49.390
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it, there's the door.

55:55.860 --> 55:57.230
Yeah!

56:01.610 --> 56:02.860
Hit!

56:10.040 --> 56:11.250
Pull!

56:20.550 --> 56:21.720
Pull!

56:30.730 --> 56:32.890
I think she wants the Gallagher!

56:42.240 --> 56:44.160
I'm only gonna say this once.

56:47.660 --> 56:48.990
Get out.

56:55.500 --> 56:58.590
You don't deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!

57:00.210 --> 57:01.380
Goldstein.

57:02.630 --> 57:03.840
Yes, Mr Stark?

57:03.920 --> 57:07.180
Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy's ass to.

57:10.970 --> 57:12.980
I told you to shut it down.

57:23.490 --> 57:27.070
Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.

57:33.790 --> 57:35.040
Really?

57:42.840 --> 57:46.430
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

57:47.010 --> 57:49.260
Sidekick this!

57:57.770 --> 57:59.270
Had enough?

58:00.190 --> 58:01.650
- Natalie!  - Miss Potts.

58:01.730 --> 58:03.860
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

58:03.940 --> 58:05.990
You know what? Ever since you came here...

58:09.700 --> 58:10.740
Pepper.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.620
Get out of here. Get out of here.

58:19.880 --> 58:22.630
You want it? Take it!

59:03.880 --> 59:05.090
Put your hand down.

59:05.170 --> 59:07.380
You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?

59:07.470 --> 59:08.760
We don't have to do this, Tony.

59:09.040 --> 59:10.710
You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.

59:10.790 --> 59:12.630
- Put it down!  - You gonna take a shot?

59:12.710 --> 59:13.960
- Put it down!  - No!

59:14.050 --> 59:15.510
- Drop it, Tony!  - Take it.

1:00:26.530 --> 1:00:28.940
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,

1:00:29.030 --> 1:00:32.240
inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet...

1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:17.990
Colonel.

1:01:18.950 --> 1:01:20.200
Major.

1:01:20.950 --> 1:01:22.080
Wow.

1:01:23.290 --> 1:01:24.580
Yeah.

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:28.340
Let's take it inside.

1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:29.920
Clear the area.

1:01:52.690 --> 1:01:53.900
Sir!

1:01:53.990 --> 1:01:56.450
I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.

1:02:00.490 --> 1:02:02.660
I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boy band.

1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:07.210
No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself.

1:02:07.290 --> 1:02:10.500
- How's that working out for you?  - It's... it's... it's...

1:02:12.010 --> 1:02:13.340
I'm sorry. I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

1:02:13.420 --> 1:02:15.220
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

1:02:16.340 --> 1:02:17.430
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

1:02:17.510 --> 1:02:19.850
I'm not sure if you're real or if I'm having...

1:02:19.930 --> 1:02:22.020
I am very real.

1:02:22.100 --> 1:02:24.100
I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.

1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:27.860
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?  - That's not looking so good.

1:02:28.610 --> 1:02:30.610
I've been worse.

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:33.320
We've secured the perimeter,

1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:36.280
but I don't think we should hold it for too much longer.

1:02:39.870 --> 1:02:42.700
- You're fired.  - That's not up to you.

1:02:43.410 --> 1:02:46.620
Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.

1:02:46.710 --> 1:02:47.830
- Hi.  - I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:50.540
Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

1:02:50.630 --> 1:02:52.460
I suggest you apologise.

1:02:52.550 --> 1:02:54.090
You've been very busy.

1:02:54.170 --> 1:02:57.430
You made your girl your CEO, you're giving away all your stuff.

1:02:57.510 --> 1:03:00.510
You let your friend fly away with your suit.

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.970
Now, if I didn't know better...

1:03:02.060 --> 1:03:04.060
You don't know better. I didn't give it to him. He took it.

1:03:04.140 --> 1:03:06.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

1:03:06.890 --> 1:03:10.110
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

1:03:10.190 --> 1:03:12.980
The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?

1:03:13.070 --> 1:03:14.280
Is that possible?

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:16.990
Well, according to Mr Stark's database security guidelines,

1:03:17.070 --> 1:03:20.070
there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.

1:03:22.870 --> 1:03:25.500
- What do you want from me?  - What do we want from you?

1:03:25.580 --> 1:03:27.460
What do you want from me?

1:03:27.540 --> 1:03:31.210
You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.

1:03:31.290 --> 1:03:34.550
Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe.

1:03:34.630 --> 1:03:37.670
I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.

1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:38.800
Hit him.

1:03:40.010 --> 1:03:43.350
Oh, God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

1:03:43.810 --> 1:03:46.730
Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds?

1:03:47.310 --> 1:03:50.940
- What did she just do to me?  - What did we just do for you?

1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:53.440
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:55.400
We're trying to get you back to work.

1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.570
Give me a couple of boxes of that. I'll be right as rain.

1:03:57.650 --> 1:03:59.570
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.

1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:02.160
Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.

1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:04.450
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

1:04:04.530 --> 1:04:06.910
I've been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium.

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.420
I've tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:14.590
Well, I'm here to tell you, you haven't tried them all.

1:04:16.050 --> 1:04:19.170
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

1:04:19.260 --> 1:04:20.800
Candygram.

1:04:25.010 --> 1:04:26.470
I brought you something.

1:04:27.060 --> 1:04:28.810
Oh, yeah.

1:04:31.350 --> 1:04:33.190
We got you the bird, pal.

1:04:33.270 --> 1:04:34.610
This is not my bird.

1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:37.110
What do you mean? That's the bird. This is the bird.

1:04:37.190 --> 1:04:39.990
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.

1:04:40.070 --> 1:04:41.360
This is a great bird.

1:04:41.450 --> 1:04:44.070
- It's a beautiful bird.  - We got this all the way from Russia.

1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:46.620
Hey, man, this not my bird.

1:04:48.950 --> 1:04:52.870
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:55.750
I mean, you know, look, don't get so attached to things.

1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:57.550
Learn to let go.

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:02.800
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

1:05:03.340 --> 1:05:06.470
Is that... that's not a helmet. What is that?

1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:18.530
Ivan... what's this? Jack.

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:21.530
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

1:05:21.610 --> 1:05:24.200
How... how are you supposed to get a head in there?

1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:26.120
- Jack, could you put your head in there?  - No.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:29.410
Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

1:05:29.490 --> 1:05:32.160
See, Ivan? He can't put his head in there.

1:05:32.250 --> 1:05:36.630
That's... that's not a helmet. It's a head. I need to put a guy in there.

1:05:36.710 --> 1:05:40.090
I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?

1:05:40.420 --> 1:05:42.550
- Drone better.  - What? Drone better?

1:05:42.630 --> 1:05:45.220
Why is drone better? Why is drone better?

1:05:45.300 --> 1:05:47.100
People make problem.

1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:49.060
Trust me. Drone better.

1:05:49.510 --> 1:05:53.690
Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird.

1:05:54.560 --> 1:05:56.400
You said, "No problem."

1:05:56.480 --> 1:05:59.400
That's what you said to me. You said, "No problem."

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:02.280
Now I need suits. The government wants suits.

1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:04.360
Like Iron Man. You understand?

1:06:04.450 --> 1:06:07.570
That's what the people want. That's what's gonna make them happy.

1:06:08.410 --> 1:06:09.740
Hey, man.

1:06:11.290 --> 1:06:13.870
Don't get too attached to things.

1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:16.290
Learn to let go.

1:06:19.380 --> 1:06:22.380
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

1:06:23.010 --> 1:06:26.430
You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.

1:06:36.020 --> 1:06:37.690
Unbelievable.

1:06:38.150 --> 1:06:40.820
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

1:06:40.900 --> 1:06:44.280
- It's functional?  - Fully mission-capable.

1:06:44.650 --> 1:06:48.030
Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponize it.

1:06:49.030 --> 1:06:50.080
Sir?

1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:52.790
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo.

1:06:52.870 --> 1:06:54.500
We'd like this to introduce it.

1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:56.160
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

1:06:56.250 --> 1:06:59.040
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.

1:06:59.130 --> 1:07:02.170
- We've got to make this happen.  - Yes, General, but...

1:07:02.250 --> 1:07:04.260
It's also an order.

1:07:04.630 --> 1:07:05.970
Yes, sir.

1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:09.800
Good work, Colonel. You've made your country proud.

1:07:09.890 --> 1:07:11.510
Thank you, sir.

1:07:17.690 --> 1:07:21.400
That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.

1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:22.520
No, it was finished.

1:07:22.610 --> 1:07:26.740
It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

1:07:26.820 --> 1:07:28.950
No. Howard said the arc reactor

1:07:29.030 --> 1:07:30.780
was the stepping stone to something greater.

1:07:30.870 --> 1:07:35.370
He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

1:07:35.870 --> 1:07:37.000
He was on to something big,

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:40.540
something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor

1:07:40.630 --> 1:07:42.630
look like a triple-A battery.

1:07:42.710 --> 1:07:45.210
Just him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1:07:45.300 --> 1:07:48.380
Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin.

1:07:48.470 --> 1:07:50.510
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1:07:50.590 --> 1:07:52.970
When your father found out, he had him deported.

1:07:53.050 --> 1:07:54.970
When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver,

1:07:55.060 --> 1:07:56.600
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:59.440
and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:02.060
Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in,

1:08:02.150 --> 1:08:06.280
the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1:08:06.650 --> 1:08:07.990
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1:08:08.070 --> 1:08:10.280
What do you mean I haven't tried everything? What haven't I tried?

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:14.620
He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge

1:08:14.740 --> 1:08:16.750
to finish what he started.

1:08:16.830 --> 1:08:18.330
He said that?

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:21.120
Are you that guy? Are you?

1:08:21.210 --> 1:08:26.510
'Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:32.260
I don't know where you get your information,

1:08:32.340 --> 1:08:34.600
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:36.060
What do you remember about your dad?

1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:37.850
He was cold, he was calculating.

1:08:37.930 --> 1:08:40.690
He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me,

1:08:40.770 --> 1:08:42.350
so it's a little tough for me to digest

1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:44.900
when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me

1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:47.940
and he's passing it down. I don't get that.

1:08:48.030 --> 1:08:49.280
You're talking about a guy whose happiest day

1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:50.860
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

1:08:50.950 --> 1:08:52.030
That's not true.

1:08:52.110 --> 1:08:54.780
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:58.870
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1:08:58.950 --> 1:09:00.120
What?

1:09:00.660 --> 1:09:02.750
- I got a 2:00.  - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:09:02.830 --> 1:09:04.380
- What's this?  - Okay, you're good, right?

1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:06.210
- No, I'm not good.  - You got this? Right? Right?

1:09:06.290 --> 1:09:08.170
Got what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to get.

1:09:08.260 --> 1:09:11.510
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact.

1:09:11.590 --> 1:09:14.510
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?  - Yeah.

1:09:14.930 --> 1:09:16.430
And Tony,

1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:20.680
remember, I got my eye on you.

1:09:26.730 --> 1:09:29.990
We've disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world.

1:09:30.070 --> 1:09:31.440
Good luck.

1:09:35.530 --> 1:09:36.780
Please.

1:09:37.370 --> 1:09:40.580
First thing, I need a little bodywork. I'll put in a little time at the lab.

1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:42.830
If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean,

1:09:42.910 --> 1:09:45.500
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that'd be nice.

1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:46.710
I'm not here for that.

1:09:46.790 --> 1:09:48.250
I've been authorised by Director Fury

1:09:48.340 --> 1:09:50.800
to use any means necessary to keep you on premises.

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:53.510
If you attempt to leave or play any games,

1:09:53.590 --> 1:09:56.800
I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet.

1:09:56.890 --> 1:09:59.140
- Okay?  - I think I got it, yeah.

1:09:59.220 --> 1:10:01.100
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:29.090
Think this is the power source?

1:10:29.170 --> 1:10:33.970
Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

1:10:35.090 --> 1:10:36.430
Yes, sir.

1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:38.140
Oh, yes!

1:10:38.550 --> 1:10:40.470
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:42.310
Is it my birthday?

1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:46.020
You got it. What did you do? What did you do?

1:10:49.150 --> 1:10:51.980
- Is this what I think it is?  - Yes, it is.

1:10:52.070 --> 1:10:55.150
Hammer, I want to know what you're gonna do for us.

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:56.820
What am I going to do for you?

1:10:56.910 --> 1:10:59.660
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

1:11:00.030 --> 1:11:03.040
- And then, second, I think I should...  - That's not what I'm talking about.

1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:05.460
I'm talking about firepower.

1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:09.040
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

1:11:10.340 --> 1:11:13.630
Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.260
Too downtown? I agree.

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.050
M24 shotgun, pump action.

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:21.970
Five-round magazine.

1:11:22.060 --> 1:11:23.390
You know what? You're not a hunter.

1:11:23.470 --> 1:11:25.560
What am I talking about? I'm getting rid of it.

1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:28.100
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

1:11:28.190 --> 1:11:30.480
They do make something better than waffles.

1:11:31.310 --> 1:11:33.440
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't disco enough for you,

1:11:33.530 --> 1:11:34.820
so I'm gonna put it right here.

1:11:34.900 --> 1:11:37.950
You're looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

1:11:38.030 --> 1:11:41.070
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:42.660
You're tough.

1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:45.250
Let me tell you something. Size does matter.

1:11:45.330 --> 1:11:46.830
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1:11:47.250 --> 1:11:50.540
This is an M1347 .62 Minigun.

1:11:50.630 --> 1:11:54.090
Six individual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker.

1:11:54.170 --> 1:11:56.300
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho,

1:11:56.380 --> 1:11:58.760
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:02.850
Okay.

1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:08.560
These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

1:12:10.230 --> 1:12:12.150
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

1:12:12.230 --> 1:12:16.530
with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

1:12:17.110 --> 1:12:20.610
It's capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted.

1:12:20.700 --> 1:12:22.870
If it were any smarter, it would write a book.

1:12:22.950 --> 1:12:26.370
A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon.

1:12:26.950 --> 1:12:28.200
It would read it to you.

1:12:28.870 --> 1:12:30.370
This is my Eiffel Tower.

1:12:30.450 --> 1:12:33.540
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third. My Pieta'.

1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:36.710
It's completely elegant. It's bafflingly beautiful.

1:12:36.790 --> 1:12:41.510
It's capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero.

1:12:42.590 --> 1:12:44.510
I call it the Ex-Wife.

1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:51.560
That's the best I got.

1:12:56.650 --> 1:12:58.320
Are we gonna do this? Give me something here.

1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:02.360
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.  - I think I'll take it.

1:13:02.650 --> 1:13:05.320
- Which one?  - All of it.

1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:08.320
All of it.

1:13:45.730 --> 1:13:49.360
Everything is achievable through technology.

1:13:49.610 --> 1:13:51.990
Better living, robust health

1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:57.910
and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.

1:13:58.420 --> 1:13:59.670
I'm Howard Stark,

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:03.750
and everything you'll need for the future can be found right here.

1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:06.880
City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of...

1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:13.850
I'm Howard Stark,

1:14:13.930 --> 1:14:17.850
and everything you'll need in the future can be found right here.

1:14:17.930 --> 1:14:20.770
So, from all of us at Stark Industries,

1:14:20.900 --> 1:14:23.190
I would like to personally...

1:14:23.770 --> 1:14:26.030
Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that?

1:14:26.110 --> 1:14:29.740
Put that back. Put it back where you got it from.

1:14:29.950 --> 1:14:32.120
Where's your mother? Maria?

1:14:32.530 --> 1:14:34.450
Go on. Go, go, go...

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:38.960
All right, I think we got...

1:14:39.290 --> 1:14:41.120
I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...

1:14:45.050 --> 1:14:46.960
Are you waiting on me?

1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:53.390
So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I'd like to personally show you

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.220
my ass.

1:14:55.310 --> 1:14:57.390
I'd like to... I can't... This is...

1:14:57.470 --> 1:14:59.810
I can't... We have this, don't we?

1:14:59.940 --> 1:15:02.900
This is a ridiculous way...

1:15:03.310 --> 1:15:04.820
Everything

1:15:05.820 --> 1:15:07.320
is achievable

1:15:08.110 --> 1:15:09.990
through technology.

1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:23.580
Tony?

1:15:23.670 --> 1:15:25.590
You're too young to understand this right now,

1:15:25.670 --> 1:15:28.670
so I thought I would put it on film for you.

1:15:30.510 --> 1:15:32.340
I built this for you.

1:15:33.340 --> 1:15:35.930
And someday you'll realise that it represents a whole lot more

1:15:36.010 --> 1:15:40.020
than just people's inventions. It represents my life's work.

1:15:41.180 --> 1:15:43.520
This is the key to the future.

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:51.280
I'm limited by the technology of my time, but one day you'll figure this out.

1:15:52.150 --> 1:15:53.860
And when you do,

1:15:54.780 --> 1:15:56.870
you will change the world.

1:15:58.330 --> 1:16:02.290
What is and always will be my greatest creation

1:16:04.670 --> 1:16:06.040
is you.

1:16:27.020 --> 1:16:29.820
- $6. Six.  - I don't have any dough.

1:16:29.900 --> 1:16:31.480
- Here.  - No, sir, that's too much.

1:16:31.570 --> 1:16:32.740
No, it's fine. Take that.

1:16:32.860 --> 1:16:34.860
- It's fine.  - No, sefior.

1:16:35.070 --> 1:16:38.070
Take it. Take it. I don't like people handing me things.

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:40.080
If you just drop that there, that'd be great.

1:16:40.410 --> 1:16:43.040
- Are you Iron Man?  - Sometimes.

1:16:43.210 --> 1:16:44.920
We believe in you.

1:16:45.370 --> 1:16:48.080
It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.

1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:49.590
- Miss Potts?  - Relax.

1:16:49.710 --> 1:16:50.750
- Mr Stark...  - Is here.

1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:52.670
- He refuses...  - I don't. It's fine.

1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:55.340
- I'll just be a second.  - Listen, it's our position

1:16:55.430 --> 1:16:57.680
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.510
proprietary ownership of the Mark ll platform.

1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:03.350
When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man,

1:17:03.430 --> 1:17:05.600
- he was making a promise to America.  - No, the suit belongs to us.

1:17:05.730 --> 1:17:07.600
We trusted that he would look out for us.

1:17:07.730 --> 1:17:09.770
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...  - He obviously did not.

1:17:09.900 --> 1:17:12.190
- And now we learn that his secretary...  - Yes, it does.

1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:14.610
a woman named Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

1:17:14.740 --> 1:17:17.450
has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries.

1:17:17.530 --> 1:17:19.030
What are her qualifications?

1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:20.200
- No.  - Ms Potts is doing

1:17:20.280 --> 1:17:21.450
nothing to manage this terrible...

1:17:21.530 --> 1:17:23.040
- Mute.  - No...

1:17:23.870 --> 1:17:25.870
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:28.380
Don't tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country

1:17:28.460 --> 1:17:30.590
and then not let me pursue this.

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:32.050
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1:17:32.130 --> 1:17:34.970
Well, then, tell the President to sign an order.

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:37.220
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1:17:37.300 --> 1:17:40.300
Hammer's giving some presentation tomorrow evening.

1:17:40.390 --> 1:17:43.270
- Will Tony Stark be there?  - Will I?

1:17:43.890 --> 1:17:46.140
- No, he will not. Bye.  - I would like to be.

1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:48.480
- Got a minute?  - No.

1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:51.310
Come on, you just got off the phone. You're fine, 30 seconds.

1:17:52.770 --> 1:17:55.070
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1:17:55.150 --> 1:17:56.820
I was just driving over here,

1:17:56.900 --> 1:17:59.410
and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I'm not.

1:17:59.490 --> 1:18:02.240
- You didn't come here to apologise?  - Look, that goes without saying,

1:18:02.330 --> 1:18:03.910
and I'm working on that.

1:18:03.990 --> 1:18:08.000
But I haven't been entirely upfront with you,

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:09.250
and I just want to try to make good.

1:18:09.330 --> 1:18:11.670
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1:18:11.750 --> 1:18:12.840
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:14.090
- I'm trying to get some...  - No.

1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:19.180
Do you know how short life is?

1:18:19.300 --> 1:18:22.350
And if I never got to express...

1:18:22.430 --> 1:18:25.100
And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1:18:25.180 --> 1:18:27.600
And I don't care... I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:29.350
I'm not expecting you to...

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:30.600
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1:18:30.690 --> 1:18:32.520
- I'm just gonna say it.  - Let me stop you right here, okay?

1:18:32.650 --> 1:18:35.110
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1:18:35.190 --> 1:18:37.990
I'm gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think.

1:18:38.530 --> 1:18:40.450
I am trying to run a company.

1:18:40.530 --> 1:18:43.120
- Do you have any idea what that entails?  - Yes.

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:46.200
People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared,

1:18:46.290 --> 1:18:49.620
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat for it.

1:18:52.210 --> 1:18:55.710
I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do.

1:18:59.470 --> 1:19:01.800
Did you bring me strawberries?

1:19:02.890 --> 1:19:06.310
Did you know that there's only one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1:19:06.390 --> 1:19:08.680
Allergic to strawberries.

1:19:11.230 --> 1:19:12.230
This is progress, Pepper.

1:19:12.350 --> 1:19:15.070
I knew there was a correlation between you and this.

1:19:15.980 --> 1:19:17.230
- I need you...  - I need you, too.

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:19.990
- to leave now.  - That's what I'm trying to...

1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:26.580
Ms Potts?

1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:30.540
- Hi, come on in.  - Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:32.420
Thank you.

1:19:34.210 --> 1:19:35.670
- Anything else, boss?  - I'm good, Hap.

1:19:35.750 --> 1:19:38.880
No, I'll be just... another minute.

1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:41.510
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:46.850
No.

1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:54.100
Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here at Stark Enterprises?

1:19:55.270 --> 1:19:57.520
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1:19:57.610 --> 1:20:00.530
I thought you two didn't get along.

1:20:00.610 --> 1:20:03.950
- No. That's not so.  - It's just me you don't care for.

1:20:04.110 --> 1:20:06.530
- No? Nothing?  - Actually, while you're here,

1:20:06.620 --> 1:20:09.700
maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.

1:20:09.790 --> 1:20:11.250
Absolutely.

1:20:17.710 --> 1:20:18.710
I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:19.880
50V, You're good.

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:22.550
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it?

1:20:22.630 --> 1:20:24.470
You just tear things... You're a triple impostor.

1:20:24.550 --> 1:20:26.800
I've never seen anything like you. ls there anything real about you?

1:20:26.930 --> 1:20:27.970
Do you even speak Latin?

1:20:30.140 --> 1:20:32.810
Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?

1:20:32.890 --> 1:20:36.150
It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.

1:20:37.730 --> 1:20:39.150
You're good.

1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:41.590
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?

1:21:41.710 --> 1:21:44.210
I need a manipulatable projection.

1:21:51.510 --> 1:21:55.060
1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.

1:21:57.270 --> 1:21:59.100
How many buildings are there?

1:21:59.230 --> 1:22:01.650
Am I to include the Belgian waffle stands?

1:22:01.730 --> 1:22:04.280
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:21.670
What does that look like to you, Jarvis? Not unlike an atom.

1:22:21.750 --> 1:22:25.260
In which case the nucleus would be here.

1:22:26.300 --> 1:22:28.420
Highlight the unisphere.

1:22:37.230 --> 1:22:42.230
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.  - What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1:22:42.310 --> 1:22:44.150
I'm discovering... Correction.

1:22:44.270 --> 1:22:48.240
I'm rediscovering a new element, I believe.

1:22:48.990 --> 1:22:52.030
Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.

1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:54.450
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1:22:59.250 --> 1:23:05.250
Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework.

1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:09.470
Dad.

1:23:30.700 --> 1:23:35.490
Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.

1:23:41.660 --> 1:23:46.290
The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.

1:23:46.380 --> 1:23:47.460
Thanks, Dad.

1:23:47.550 --> 1:23:50.800
Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.

1:23:55.350 --> 1:23:58.890
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We're back in hardware mode.

1:24:46.220 --> 1:24:48.520
- I heard you broke the perimeter.  - Yeah.

1:24:49.100 --> 1:24:51.020
That was, like, three years ago. Where you been?

1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:55.110
- I was doing some stuff.  - Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1:24:55.230 --> 1:24:57.190
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Coulson,

1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:59.360
you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:01.240
Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?

1:25:03.570 --> 1:25:05.580
What's this doing here?

1:25:07.410 --> 1:25:08.450
That's it.

1:25:09.750 --> 1:25:11.870
- Bring that to me.  - You know what this is?

1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:13.460
It's exactly what I need to make this work.

1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:16.460
Lift the coil.

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:18.300
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1:25:19.050 --> 1:25:20.920
There you go. And...

1:25:21.930 --> 1:25:23.890
Drop it. Drop it.

1:25:27.060 --> 1:25:30.140
Perfectly level. I'm busy. What do you want?

1:25:30.270 --> 1:25:33.440
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1:25:33.980 --> 1:25:35.560
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1:25:35.650 --> 1:25:38.110
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.  - So I'm told.

1:25:38.230 --> 1:25:40.280
- Secret stuff?  - Something like that.

1:25:41.650 --> 1:25:42.700
- Good luck.  - Bye.

1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:44.860
- Thanks.  - We need you.

1:25:44.950 --> 1:25:47.950
- Yeah, more than you know.  - Not that much.

1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:08.930
Initialising prismatic accelerator.

1:26:14.980 --> 1:26:17.440
Approaching maximum power.

1:27:04.900 --> 1:27:06.150
That was easy.

1:27:22.710 --> 1:27:24.670
Congratulations, sir.

1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:28.890
You have created a new element.

1:27:36.850 --> 1:27:40.650
Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core.

1:27:40.730 --> 1:27:43.360
I will begin running diagnostics.

1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:50.570
Hey, Ivan.

1:27:50.870 --> 1:27:52.490
I got Senator Stern here.

1:27:52.580 --> 1:27:54.910
Thought we'd swing over and look at some of the drone designs.

1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:57.290
The drone is not going to be ready.

1:27:57.580 --> 1:27:58.790
Not ready? What do you mean?

1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:02.340
I can make presentation, not demonstration.

1:28:02.420 --> 1:28:04.420
What the hell is the difference?

1:28:04.550 --> 1:28:07.300
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1:28:07.590 --> 1:28:09.430
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1:28:09.550 --> 1:28:12.640
What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:16.060
- I can make salute.  - You can make salute?

1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:17.520
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:21.690
What the hell does that mean, Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1:28:21.770 --> 1:28:24.400
You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:28.610
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.  - This is not what I wanted.

1:28:40.750 --> 1:28:43.330
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:50.510
Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1:28:51.470 --> 1:28:54.850
You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1:28:54.970 --> 1:28:58.850
You love that bird, don't you? You know what? Take the bird.

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:01.810
Hey!

1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:06.520
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:09.740
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:15.490
I took your stuff.

1:29:15.580 --> 1:29:18.750
How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad?

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:22.170
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:26.000
We had a contract.

1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:28.380
I saved your life

1:29:29.170 --> 1:29:31.170
and you give me suits.

1:29:31.670 --> 1:29:33.430
That was our deal.

1:29:33.510 --> 1:29:35.550
And you did not deliver.

1:29:36.390 --> 1:29:40.890
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud. I don't know what you are.

1:29:43.230 --> 1:29:46.560
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

1:29:47.190 --> 1:29:50.400
And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1:29:50.690 --> 1:29:54.450
Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.

1:29:54.700 --> 1:29:56.450
And now your overpriced paperweights

1:29:56.530 --> 1:29:59.120
are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

1:29:59.620 --> 1:30:01.870
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:08.380
I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian!

1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:13.630
I'm gonna leave now.

1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:16.800
I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid.

1:30:17.550 --> 1:30:19.390
You see these guys? They're your babysitters.

1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:22.060
They are not to be trifled with.

1:30:22.430 --> 1:30:24.310
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate

1:30:24.390 --> 1:30:26.730
the terms of our agreement.

1:30:27.310 --> 1:30:29.400
And you're gonna make good on our arrangement

1:30:29.900 --> 1:30:31.030
because if you don't,

1:30:31.110 --> 1:30:33.530
you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you,

1:30:33.610 --> 1:30:35.280
a dead man.

1:30:35.410 --> 1:30:36.780
You got that?

1:30:37.740 --> 1:30:40.080
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1:30:49.500 --> 1:30:51.880
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess? You're killing me.

1:30:51.960 --> 1:30:53.380
- You know I don't...  - Incoming call

1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:55.220
with a blocked number, sir.

1:30:55.300 --> 1:30:58.510
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1:30:58.590 --> 1:31:00.050
Coulson. How's the Land of Enchantment?

1:31:00.140 --> 1:31:02.850
Hey, Tony. How are you doing?

1:31:04.430 --> 1:31:06.480
- I double cycle.  - You what?

1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:11.360
You told me double cycle's more power. Good advice.

1:31:11.690 --> 1:31:13.360
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.

1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:14.940
You, too.

1:31:17.530 --> 1:31:18.870
- Trace him.  - Sir.

1:31:18.950 --> 1:31:22.700
Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.

1:31:22.790 --> 1:31:23.870
Jarvis, where is he?

1:31:23.950 --> 1:31:28.080
Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.

1:31:28.170 --> 1:31:32.300
What your father did to my family over 40 years,

1:31:33.130 --> 1:31:35.800
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1:31:35.970 --> 1:31:37.880
Sounds good. Let's get together and hash it out.

1:31:38.180 --> 1:31:39.510
Tri-State area.

1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:41.850
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1:31:41.970 --> 1:31:43.850
I hope you're ready.

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:48.640
Call trace incomplete.

1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:01.820
- Sir...  - You want to run some tests, run them.

1:32:02.830 --> 1:32:04.790
And assemble the suit while you're at it. Put it together now.

1:32:04.870 --> 1:32:07.330
- We are unclear as to the effects...  - I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1:32:11.710 --> 1:32:13.800
That tastes like coconut.

1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:15.590
And metal.

1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:17.510
Oh, wow, yeah!

1:32:30.100 --> 1:32:31.940
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1:32:32.020 --> 1:32:33.310
Thank you, Happy...

1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:38.190
Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

1:32:56.630 --> 1:32:57.880
Yeah.

1:32:59.050 --> 1:33:02.390
That's what I'm talking about. Thanks for coming.

1:33:02.970 --> 1:33:04.930
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,

1:33:05.050 --> 1:33:09.560
this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm's way,

1:33:09.730 --> 1:33:11.350
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:15.110
and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us.

1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:18.690
Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach.

1:33:18.780 --> 1:33:21.110
That's not fair. That's not right.

1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:23.450
- And it's just too bad.  - Oh, Lord.

1:33:23.530 --> 1:33:25.620
Regardless, it was an impressive innovation,

1:33:25.700 --> 1:33:28.620
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.620
Well, today, my friends,

1:33:30.710 --> 1:33:34.170
the press is faced with quite a different problem.

1:33:34.670 --> 1:33:37.170
They are about to run out of ink.

1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:44.680
Get that out of here.

1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:47.510
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:50.930
today I present to you

1:33:51.220 --> 1:33:54.390
the new face of the United States military.

1:33:55.770 --> 1:33:57.060
The Hammer drone.

1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:01.020
Army!

1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:15.330
Navy!

1:34:25.540 --> 1:34:27.000
Air Force!

1:34:34.890 --> 1:34:36.180
Marines!

1:34:48.070 --> 1:34:49.240
Yeah!

1:34:49.490 --> 1:34:50.690
Yeah!

1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:57.280
That's a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1:34:58.410 --> 1:35:01.290
But as revolutionary as this technology is,

1:35:01.370 --> 1:35:05.080
there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war.

1:35:05.670 --> 1:35:08.710
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you

1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:10.550
the very first prototype

1:35:10.630 --> 1:35:13.930
in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit

1:35:14.010 --> 1:35:17.850
and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

1:35:19.390 --> 1:35:20.640
What?

1:35:42.550 --> 1:35:45.720
For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for...

1:36:01.860 --> 1:36:03.530
We got trouble.

1:36:03.610 --> 1:36:05.320
Tony, there are civilians present.

1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:08.030
I'm here on orders. Let's not do this right now.

1:36:08.110 --> 1:36:09.410
Give them a wave.

1:36:09.490 --> 1:36:11.660
Hey, all right. Yeah.

1:36:11.740 --> 1:36:13.790
All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here.

1:36:13.870 --> 1:36:15.870
You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.

1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:18.040
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?

1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.170
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1:36:20.250 --> 1:36:21.880
Vanko's alive?

1:36:23.090 --> 1:36:24.260
Yeah.

1:36:24.340 --> 1:36:25.590
Where is he?

1:36:25.970 --> 1:36:27.970
- What?  - Where's Vanko?

1:36:28.430 --> 1:36:29.720
- Who?  - Tell me.

1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:32.350
What are you doing here, man?

1:36:32.430 --> 1:36:34.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:40.900
- Is that you?  - No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:44.650
I can't move. I'm locked up. I'm locked up!

1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:47.610
Get out of here. Go! This whole system's been compromised.

1:36:48.990 --> 1:36:50.910
Let's take it outside.

1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:04.300
No. No!

1:37:14.260 --> 1:37:17.480
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.  - Yes, sir.

1:37:19.310 --> 1:37:22.230
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on. I have target lock.

1:37:22.310 --> 1:37:23.980
- On what?  - On you.

1:37:28.990 --> 1:37:30.820
Tony, on your six!

1:37:48.170 --> 1:37:50.510
- What's going on? What's happening?  - The software's been overridden.

1:37:50.630 --> 1:37:51.840
What? What do you mean it's been overridden?

1:37:51.930 --> 1:37:53.260
- What does that mean?  - I think he slaved the drones.

1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:54.430
That's impossible.

1:37:54.510 --> 1:37:56.180
- Call the guards.  - All the phones are down, sir.

1:37:56.310 --> 1:37:58.430
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:00.020
Their cell phones are not working, either, sir.

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.350
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:02.600
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1:38:02.690 --> 1:38:04.270
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:05.690
- I've got this handled.  - Have you now?

1:38:05.770 --> 1:38:06.860
Yes, I do.

1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:09.440
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up, this wouldn't be happening.

1:38:09.530 --> 1:38:11.860
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.620
Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here.

1:38:14.820 --> 1:38:16.280
What?

1:38:16.370 --> 1:38:17.700
You tell me who's behind this.

1:38:17.790 --> 1:38:22.330
- Who's behind this?  - Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1:38:22.710 --> 1:38:25.330
- Where is he?  - He's at my facility.

1:38:28.670 --> 1:38:30.300
- I need NYPD, please.  - No, no, no!

1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:31.550
- Command Central.  - No, no, honey.

1:38:31.670 --> 1:38:33.550
- Don't call the authorities.  - Okay. Right away. Right away.

1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:35.720
Step aside. Step aside.

1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:38.350
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1:38:45.730 --> 1:38:48.730
- How are we doing, Jarvis?  - Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1:39:06.250 --> 1:39:07.750
This way.

1:39:08.420 --> 1:39:10.250
Nobody's answering the phone. What's going on?

1:39:10.340 --> 1:39:12.590
Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

1:39:12.670 --> 1:39:15.090
- I'm not taking you anywhere.  - Fine. You want me to drive?

1:39:15.180 --> 1:39:17.720
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1:40:16.150 --> 1:40:17.820
Nice work, kid.

1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:22.950
- You got multiples coming in on you.  - Let's get this away from the Expo.

1:40:28.330 --> 1:40:30.750
When we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter.

1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:34.510
I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target.

1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:39.430
- Watch the road.  - I got it. I got it.

1:41:09.830 --> 1:41:10.880
Listen, listen.

1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000
A pack just peeled off. They're headed back to the Expo.

1:41:13.090 --> 1:41:14.420
Got it.

1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:19.680
I'm closing on you.

1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:22.180
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1:41:38.030 --> 1:41:40.700
- Stay in the car.  - I'm not staying in the car.

1:41:40.780 --> 1:41:42.360
I said, stay in the car.

1:41:42.530 --> 1:41:44.530
What are you wearing?

1:41:45.780 --> 1:41:48.080
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.

1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:49.580
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1:41:49.710 --> 1:41:50.960
Okay.

1:41:54.460 --> 1:41:56.750
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1:41:57.210 --> 1:41:58.760
Hold on. Hey!

1:42:43.470 --> 1:42:45.390
Each set of drones is communicating

1:42:45.470 --> 1:42:48.220
- in its own unique language.  - Well, choose one and focus on that.

1:42:48.310 --> 1:42:50.310
Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian?

1:42:53.980 --> 1:42:56.360
Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.

1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:58.690
We got it. We're on our way.

1:43:40.150 --> 1:43:41.570
I got him!

1:43:56.420 --> 1:43:58.460
- Rhodey, you still locked on?  - Yeah.

1:43:58.540 --> 1:44:02.050
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We're about to get wet on this ride.

1:44:04.210 --> 1:44:05.340
Wait, wait, wait!

1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:26.360
He's gone.

1:44:30.410 --> 1:44:32.450
I'm sorry, buddy. Had to thin out the herd.

1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:35.080
What's your 20?

1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:49.550
- What are you doing?  - I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1:44:55.930 --> 1:44:56.980
Tony!

1:45:13.490 --> 1:45:15.160
Reboot complete.

1:45:15.830 --> 1:45:17.580
You got your best friend back.

1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:21.040
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.  - Well done with the new chest piece.

1:45:21.130 --> 1:45:24.800
I am reading significantly higher output and your vitals all look promising.

1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:27.630
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying. Thank you.

1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:29.800
What do you mean you're not dying? Did you just say you're dying?

1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:31.640
Is that you? No, I'm not.

1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:33.260
- Not any more.  - What's going on?

1:45:33.350 --> 1:45:35.100
I was going to tell you. I didn't want to alarm you.

1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:36.680
You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?

1:45:36.810 --> 1:45:38.520
- You didn't let me.  - Why didn't you tell me that?

1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:41.350
I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.

1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:44.400
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming, Tony.

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:46.070
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1:45:46.150 --> 1:45:47.990
- Great. Pepper?  - Are you okay now?

1:45:48.070 --> 1:45:49.280
I am fine. Don't be mad.

1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:50.950
- I will formally apologise...  - I am mad!

1:45:51.030 --> 1:45:53.990
When I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack.

1:45:54.070 --> 1:45:55.490
- Fine.  - We could have been in Venice.

1:45:55.580 --> 1:45:56.620
Oh, please.

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:01.370
Rhodes?

1:46:01.830 --> 1:46:04.500
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.

1:46:05.250 --> 1:46:07.550
They're coming. Come on, let's roll. Get up.

1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:13.010
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1:46:16.510 --> 1:46:17.850
You Okay?

1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:19.560
Yeah, thanks.

1:46:21.100 --> 1:46:23.520
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?  - Don't be.

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:24.810
No. I should have trusted you more.

1:46:24.900 --> 1:46:26.480
I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

1:46:26.570 --> 1:46:28.900
No. It's your fault. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1:46:29.030 --> 1:46:32.280
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear. Partner.

1:46:32.530 --> 1:46:36.120
They're coming in hot, any second. What's the play?

1:46:36.740 --> 1:46:38.370
Well, we want to take the high ground, okay?

1:46:38.450 --> 1:46:40.040
So let's put the biggest gun up on that ridge.

1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:41.410
Got you.

1:46:42.250 --> 1:46:43.330
- Where do you want to be?  - Where are you going?

1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:45.040
- What're you talking about?  - I meant me.

1:46:45.130 --> 1:46:47.130
You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.

1:46:47.210 --> 1:46:48.590
- Tony, don't be jealous.  - No. It's subtle,

1:46:48.710 --> 1:46:49.840
- All the bells and whistles.  - Yeah.

1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:52.420
- It's called being a badass.  - Fine.

1:46:53.130 --> 1:46:56.510
All right. You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1:46:56.600 --> 1:46:58.470
Don't stay down here. This is the worst place to be.

1:46:58.560 --> 1:46:59.810
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1:46:59.890 --> 1:47:02.810
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay? This is where you go to die.

1:47:52.630 --> 1:47:54.340
- See that?  - Yeah, yeah, nice.

1:48:02.350 --> 1:48:03.640
Rhodey?

1:48:04.980 --> 1:48:06.480
Get down.

1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:19.160
Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.

1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:22.580
Yeah. Sorry, boss. I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.160
I told you that five minutes ago.

1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:29.880
That's your guy here.

1:48:31.210 --> 1:48:33.210
- Excuse me?  - You're being placed under arrest.

1:48:33.340 --> 1:48:34.760
- Are you kidding me?  - Hands behind your back, sir.

1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:36.510
I'm trying to help here.

1:48:40.590 --> 1:48:44.140
I get it. I see what you're doing. You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1:48:44.220 --> 1:48:45.810
That's good. That's good.

1:48:45.890 --> 1:48:48.850
You're starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition.

1:48:49.020 --> 1:48:51.400
I like that. You think you're making a problem for me?

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:52.570
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1:48:52.690 --> 1:48:55.690
I'm gonna be seeing you again real soon.

1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:01.370
When they get here, I think you should station them

1:49:01.450 --> 1:49:04.290
at the south, east and both west exits.

1:49:04.370 --> 1:49:06.450
We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.

1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:09.330
Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.

1:49:09.420 --> 1:49:10.920
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:14.500
- No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.  - Okay.

1:49:16.260 --> 1:49:18.760
Heads up. You got one more drone incoming.

1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:20.220
This one looks different.

1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:23.050
The repulsor signature is significantly higher.

1:49:34.150 --> 1:49:35.820
Good to be back.

1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:37.780
This ain't gonna be good.

1:49:41.310 --> 1:49:43.400
I got something special for this guy.

1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:45.690
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.

1:49:45.770 --> 1:49:47.230
With the what?

1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:00.120
- Hammer tech?  - Yeah.

1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:03.540
I got this.

1:50:56.470 --> 1:50:58.470
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1:50:58.850 --> 1:51:01.350
- You want to be a hero?  - What?

1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:04.640
I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.

1:51:04.730 --> 1:51:06.600
- This is your idea?  - Yep.

1:51:07.310 --> 1:51:09.900
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1:51:13.690 --> 1:51:14.780
Take it.

1:51:43.350 --> 1:51:44.770
You lose.

1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:55.070
All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here, man.

1:51:55.570 --> 1:51:56.820
Pepper?

1:52:36.990 --> 1:52:38.740
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

1:52:38.820 --> 1:52:40.240
- You can't?  - I can't take this.

1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:41.740
- Look at me.  - My body, literally,

1:52:41.820 --> 1:52:43.080
cannot handle the stress.

1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:47.660
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself or wreck the whole company.

1:52:47.750 --> 1:52:49.750
I think I did okay.

1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:51.960
I quit. I'm resigning.

1:52:52.580 --> 1:52:53.960
That's it.

1:52:54.550 --> 1:52:57.130
What did you just say? You're done?

1:52:58.420 --> 1:53:01.930
That's surprising. No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1:53:02.340 --> 1:53:05.640
- You don't have to make any excuses.  - I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:06.850
You actually were just making excuses.

1:53:06.930 --> 1:53:08.430
- But you don't have to.  - No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:09.850
- I'm actually very justified.  - Listen. Hey, hey.

1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:12.270
- You deserve better.  - Well...

1:53:12.350 --> 1:53:14.940
You've taken such good care of me.

1:53:15.820 --> 1:53:18.240
I've been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so...

1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:19.570
Right?

1:53:19.650 --> 1:53:20.900
- Thank you.  - Yeah.

1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:24.660
- Thank you for understanding.  - Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1:53:24.740 --> 1:53:27.410
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.  - Okay. What about the press?

1:53:27.490 --> 1:53:29.370
Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:31.170
- Well, with you it's like dog years.  - I know.

1:53:31.250 --> 1:53:32.620
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:46.930
Weird.

1:53:47.180 --> 1:53:48.680
- No, it's not weird.  - It's okay, right?

1:53:48.770 --> 1:53:50.680
- Yeah.  - Run that by me again.

1:53:50.770 --> 1:53:52.640
I think it was weird.

1:53:53.060 --> 1:53:56.020
You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.

1:53:56.570 --> 1:53:59.030
- I had just quit, actually.  - Yeah, so we're not...

1:53:59.110 --> 1:54:01.610
You don't have to do that. I heard the whole thing.

1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:04.620
- You should get lost.  - I was here first. Get a roof.

1:54:05.530 --> 1:54:08.080
- I thought you were out of one-liners.  - That's the last one.

1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:10.790
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.  - Thank you. You, too.

1:54:10.870 --> 1:54:13.370
Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion,

1:54:13.460 --> 1:54:16.630
so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?

1:54:16.710 --> 1:54:18.460
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1:54:19.050 --> 1:54:20.300
It wasn't a question.

1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:29.210
How are you gonna resign if I don't accept?

1:54:49.690 --> 1:54:51.990
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1:54:52.150 --> 1:54:54.320
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

1:54:54.410 --> 1:54:59.660
Now this, on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1:55:00.910 --> 1:55:02.000
Read it.

1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:07.920
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour."

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.170
In my own defence, that was last week.

1:55:12.220 --> 1:55:15.050
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies." I was dying.

1:55:15.180 --> 1:55:17.760
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1:55:18.140 --> 1:55:20.970
"Textbook narcissism"?

1:55:23.020 --> 1:55:24.100
Agreed.

1:55:25.190 --> 1:55:26.560
Okay, here it is.

1:55:26.650 --> 1:55:29.980
"Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1:55:30.070 --> 1:55:32.610
- I gotta think about it.  - Read on.

1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:36.700
"Tony Stark not...

1:55:36.780 --> 1:55:38.320
"Not recommended"?

1:55:39.530 --> 1:55:40.740
That doesn't make any sense.

1:55:40.830 --> 1:55:43.750
How can you approve me but not approve me?

1:55:44.410 --> 1:55:45.830
I got a new ticker.

1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:48.920
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1:55:49.500 --> 1:55:52.420
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1:55:53.260 --> 1:55:55.130
Which leads us to believe at this juncture

1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:58.390
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.

1:56:05.310 --> 1:56:07.190
You can't afford me.

1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:11.780
Then again, I will waive my customary retainer

1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:14.740
in exchange for a small favour.

1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:20.620
Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.

1:56:22.450 --> 1:56:23.950
I'll see what I can do.

1:56:25.660 --> 1:56:30.500
It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards

1:56:30.590 --> 1:56:34.590
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark,

1:56:34.670 --> 1:56:38.010
who is, of course, a national treasure.

1:56:40.180 --> 1:56:41.510
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:43.970
for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

1:56:44.270 --> 1:56:46.270
- You deserve this.  - Thank you, sir.

1:56:47.980 --> 1:56:49.270
Mr Stark.

1:56:49.350 --> 1:56:53.440
Thank you for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

1:56:53.530 --> 1:56:55.190
You deserve this.

1:56:56.650 --> 1:56:59.110
Oh, sorry.

1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:02.620
Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it?

1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:05.870
Let's get a photo.

2:04:32.020 --> 2:04:33.990
Sir, we've found it.
