00:54.888 --> 00:56.598
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.135
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

01:00.310 --> 01:02.100
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

01:02.187 --> 01:03.807
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.435
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.203
See, I spent some time on Earth...

01:12.656 --> 01:15.736
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.664
Then I went searching through the cosmos

01:17.744 --> 01:20.664
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.956
Didn't find any.

01:24.126 --> 01:28.166
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,

01:28.338 --> 01:31.008
which led me all the way here
into this cage,

01:32.718 --> 01:34.008
where I met you.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.850
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

01:55.908 --> 01:59.578
Thor, son of Odin.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.420
Surtur, son of a bitch.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.672
You're still alive.

02:05.292 --> 02:09.002
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.801
I cannot die.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.724
Not until I fulfill my destiny

02:12.883 --> 02:15.143
and lay waste to your home.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.802
It's funny you should mention that.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.260
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.681
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.640
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.651
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.685
-The great prophecy...
-Hang on.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.109
Hang on.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.452
I'll be back around shortly.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.455
I really feel like
we were connecting there.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.330
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.499
My time has come.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.798
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,

02:50.963 --> 02:53.633
I shall be restored to my full might.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.049
I will tower over the mountains,

02:56.218 --> 02:58.798
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

02:58.971 --> 03:01.511
Hang on. Give it a second.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.602
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.348
I'm really sorry.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.984
Okay, so let me get this straight.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.777
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame

03:12.943 --> 03:15.323
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?

03:15.487 --> 03:16.647
A mountain!

03:16.822 --> 03:19.872
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.583
Odin is not on Asgard.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.664
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.672
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

03:28.834 --> 03:31.884
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.634
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.969
It's a crown.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.644
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok

03:40.804 --> 03:42.604
is rip that thing off your head.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.385
But Ragnarok has already begun.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.480
You cannot stop it.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.161
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.915
All will suffer, all will burn.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.788
That's intense.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.785
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big

04:08.957 --> 04:11.457
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.304
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,

04:14.463 --> 04:16.213
where I bust out of these chains,

04:16.381 --> 04:20.261
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.387
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.805
Why fight it?

04:25.015 --> 04:28.475
Because that's what heroes do.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.530
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.779
And, now!

04:43.283 --> 04:46.953
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.750
I make grave mistakes all the time.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.170
Everything seems to work out.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.708
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.632
Heimdall?

06:20.631 --> 06:22.511
Heimdall was an idiot.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.634
This job should have made him rich.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.052
Now, the job ain't easy

06:27.221 --> 06:29.141
but it does have its benefits.

06:29.306 --> 06:33.556
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.017
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.689
Behold...

06:40.859 --> 06:42.189
My stuff.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.026
I'm particularly fond of these.

06:46.198 --> 06:49.738
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.950
I even named them. Des and Troy.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.169
You see, when you put them together,

06:57.167 --> 06:58.417
they destroy.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.399
Heimdall, come on.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.593
Stay!

07:42.337 --> 07:45.217
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.087
Heimdall?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.635
Skurge?

07:52.890 --> 07:54.270
Is that important?

08:01.231 --> 08:03.151
You girls are in for a treat.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.255
Girls!

08:59.081 --> 09:02.921
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

09:03.085 --> 09:06.885
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.047
Who are you?

09:08.131 --> 09:11.301
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.718
Right. Where is Heimdall?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.891
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.682
Traitor?

09:18.851 --> 09:21.441
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty

09:21.603 --> 09:23.523
but he disappeared before the trial.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.899
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.066
Sure.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.690
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.347
What the hell is that?

10:03.228 --> 10:06.058
Oh, brother. This is it.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.611
I take my leave.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.488
You fool, you didn't listen!

10:10.652 --> 10:11.702
I'm sorry.

10:11.862 --> 10:12.902
Lady Sif, get help!

10:13.071 --> 10:14.201
Somebody, help!

10:14.990 --> 10:16.410
Sorry for all I've done.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.329
It's all right. Hold on.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.905
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.420
They'd be lucky to have you.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.422
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.382
-I just couldn't help myself.
-I know.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.745
I'm a trickster.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.762
So mischievous.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.629
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.221
It was a wonderful joke.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.510
'Twas indeed hilarious.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.890
You are the savior of Asgard.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.888
-Tell my story.
-I will.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.310
Build a statue for me.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.188
We will build a big statue for you.

10:46.355 --> 10:49.235
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.360
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.238
I didn't do it for him.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.123
I didn't do it for him.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.957
No!

11:12.548 --> 11:15.378
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

11:15.551 --> 11:17.471
giving his life for ours.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.306
He fought back those disgusting elves,

11:20.472 --> 11:22.272
he brought peace to the realm.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.732
Loki, my boy...

11:25.394 --> 11:29.234
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.480
On that day,
I did not yet see in you

11:32.651 --> 11:34.941
Asgard's savior. No.

11:35.112 --> 11:39.622
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle

11:40.409 --> 11:43.619
that melted this old fool's heart.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.583
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.378
Father.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.474
Shit.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.135
My son, Thor, has returned!

11:59.303 --> 12:00.803
Greetings, my boy.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.184
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

12:04.349 --> 12:08.439
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.

12:08.604 --> 12:09.904
Indeed they should.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.403
I like the statue.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.735
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.781
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.859
Do you know what this is?

12:19.781 --> 12:22.741
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

12:22.910 --> 12:24.450
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault

12:24.620 --> 12:27.830
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.502
Thank you, dear.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.884
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

12:34.129 --> 12:35.169
Nope.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.384
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.340
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

12:41.512 --> 12:42.642
That's just a silly dream,

12:42.804 --> 12:44.764
signs of an overactive imagination.

12:44.932 --> 12:45.932
Possibly.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.096
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.

12:48.185 --> 12:52.235
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.357
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,

12:55.526 --> 12:58.446
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,

12:58.612 --> 13:01.362
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.782
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.951
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.785
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

13:10.958 --> 13:11.958
Watching theater.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.035
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...

13:14.211 --> 13:16.051
-You're really gonna make me do it?
-Do what?

13:20.259 --> 13:24.009
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.639
Not even your face.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.056
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.735
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.611
All right, I yield.

13:43.699 --> 13:44.699
Behold!

13:45.659 --> 13:46.869
Thor...

13:47.661 --> 13:49.041
-Odinson.
-No.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.041
You had one job. Just the one.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.205
Where's Odin?

13:56.378 --> 14:00.168
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.010
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.178
-Ask them.
-Where's Father? Did you kill him?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.175
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.810
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.946
I swear I left him right here.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.288
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?

14:29.453 --> 14:30.583
Great planning.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.872
How was I supposed to know?

14:31.955 --> 14:33.285
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.544
No? Then why do you dress like one?

14:36.043 --> 14:37.923
-Hey.
-I can't believe you're alive.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.086
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.803
I'm honored.

14:42.966 --> 14:43.966
Ask him.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.804
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?

14:45.969 --> 14:46.969
Sure.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.763
Start figuring out where he is.

14:50.766 --> 14:51.766
Oh, my God.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.020
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.811
She didn't dump me, you know.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.108
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.072
What's this? What are you doing?

15:02.444 --> 15:03.454
This isn't me.

15:07.783 --> 15:08.783
Loki.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.849
Thor Odinson.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.951
God of Thunder.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.664
You can put down the umbrella.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.350
So, Earth has wizards now?

16:16.518 --> 16:18.478
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."

16:18.562 --> 16:19.562
You can leave that now.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.441
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?

16:23.901 --> 16:27.951
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.197
Take a seat.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.366
Tea?

16:37.915 --> 16:39.125
I don't drink tea.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.501
What do you drink?

16:40.667 --> 16:41.877
Not tea.

16:45.088 --> 16:48.838
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms

16:49.009 --> 16:50.299
that may be a threat to this world.

16:50.469 --> 16:54.179
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.266
He's a worthy inclusion.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.602
Then why bring him here?

17:00.771 --> 17:02.401
We're looking for my father.

17:02.898 --> 17:06.108
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,

17:06.276 --> 17:08.606
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?

17:08.779 --> 17:09.779
Promptly.

17:09.947 --> 17:11.277
Great! Then I'll help you.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.657
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

17:14.326 --> 17:16.656
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.868
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.132
And you don't have a phone.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.205
No, I don't have a phone,

17:25.379 --> 17:27.839
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.881
-Yeah, do you have a computer?
-No. What for?

17:31.343 --> 17:33.973
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.887
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.927
Gladly. He's in Norway.

17:39.643 --> 17:45.193
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.

17:45.899 --> 17:46.939
Nope.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.031
We don't need that.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.277
Will you stop doing that?

17:58.412 --> 18:01.292
I need just one strand of your hair.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.246
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.258
We could have just walked.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.724
He's waiting for you.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.101
All right.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.727
Don't forget your umbrella.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.064
Yes.

18:30.861 --> 18:31.951
Sorry.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.198
There we go.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.662
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.120
Yeah. Right.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.496
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

18:50.547 --> 18:51.797
You can handle him from here.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.881
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.052
Good luck.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.216
Handle me? Who are you?

18:59.056 --> 19:00.056
Loki.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.470
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

19:01.558 --> 19:03.098
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

19:03.268 --> 19:04.268
Bye-bye.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.843
Father?

19:32.506 --> 19:35.086
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

19:40.389 --> 19:41.969
Father, it's us.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.847
My sons.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.146
I've been waiting for you.

19:49.523 --> 19:50.943
I know. We've come to take you home.

19:51.567 --> 19:52.897
Home, yes.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.865
Your mother, she calls me.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.366
Do you hear it?

20:02.411 --> 20:03.951
Loki, lift your magic.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.253
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

20:09.418 --> 20:10.918
Frigga would have been proud.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.706
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

20:20.304 --> 20:21.934
I know we failed you.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.519
But we can make this right.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.523
I failed you.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.768
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.106
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

20:32.774 --> 20:33.824
No.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.439
It has already begun. She's coming.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.908
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.411
I cannot keep her away any longer.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.536
Father, who are you talking about?

20:48.248 --> 20:51.168
Goddess of Death. Hela.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.802
My firstborn.

20:54.922 --> 20:55.922
Your sister.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.759
Your what?

21:03.222 --> 21:06.062
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

21:07.226 --> 21:11.516
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.819
She draws her strength from Asgard,

21:17.027 --> 21:20.657
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.450
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.617
No, we won't.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.911
I'm on a different path now.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.540
This you must face alone.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.632
I love you, my sons.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.838
Look at that.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.430
Remember this place.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.472
Home.

22:26.305 --> 22:27.395
Brother.

22:35.189 --> 22:37.899
This was your doing.

23:20.359 --> 23:21.689
So he's gone.

23:25.364 --> 23:27.704
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.698
You must be Hela.

23:31.370 --> 23:32.660
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

23:32.996 --> 23:36.326
Really? You don't look like him.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.542
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.590
You sound like him.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.669
Kneel.

23:43.841 --> 23:45.181
Beg your pardon?

23:49.513 --> 23:51.063
Kneel.

23:54.268 --> 23:56.018
Before your queen.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.692
I don't think so.

24:09.408 --> 24:11.528
It's not possible.

24:12.661 --> 24:16.331
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

24:36.268 --> 24:37.438
Bring us back!

24:37.603 --> 24:38.603
No!

24:47.696 --> 24:48.776
Loki!

25:35.869 --> 25:37.329
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

25:42.626 --> 25:43.786
I'm Hela.

25:46.046 --> 25:47.706
I'm just a janitor.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.302
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

25:55.264 --> 25:57.064
How would you like a job?

28:08.438 --> 28:10.018
Are you a fighter?

28:10.816 --> 28:12.186
Or are you food?

28:12.734 --> 28:14.284
I'm just passing through.

28:14.945 --> 28:16.365
It is food.

28:16.530 --> 28:17.660
On your knees.

29:00.616 --> 29:01.866
He's mine.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.214
Wait!

29:21.011 --> 29:22.221
Wait!

29:24.473 --> 29:25.563
He's mine.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.944
So if you want him, you go through me.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.522
But we've already got him.

29:32.314 --> 29:35.154
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.152
More food.

30:12.855 --> 30:13.865
Thank you.

30:49.099 --> 30:52.689
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

30:53.145 --> 30:54.945
I've got something special.

30:55.105 --> 30:57.435
Hey! Where are you taking me?

30:58.734 --> 31:00.074
Answer me!

31:00.360 --> 31:01.570
Hey!

31:01.737 --> 31:04.357
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.369
Many apologies, your majesty.

31:36.271 --> 31:39.941
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

31:46.907 --> 31:50.447
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

31:50.619 --> 31:52.999
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,

31:53.163 --> 31:56.543
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.

32:01.088 --> 32:03.718
My father is dead.

32:03.882 --> 32:05.762
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

32:06.385 --> 32:09.855
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the cosmos.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.183
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

32:12.349 --> 32:15.439
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

32:15.602 --> 32:19.022
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

32:19.857 --> 32:22.977
And I am here to restore that power.

32:24.361 --> 32:25.991
Kneel before me

32:26.154 --> 32:30.204
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

32:31.577 --> 32:33.327
Whoever you are,

32:33.495 --> 32:36.495
whatever you've done, surrender now!

32:36.665 --> 32:38.885
Or we will show you no mercy.

32:39.042 --> 32:43.252
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?

32:43.422 --> 32:45.472
This is your last warning!

32:47.718 --> 32:49.928
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.807
Fine.

33:10.115 --> 33:11.525
Charge!

34:05.921 --> 34:07.921
I've missed this.

34:08.257 --> 34:10.007
Still, it's a shame.

34:10.384 --> 34:12.594
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

34:12.678 --> 34:14.968
all because
they couldn't see the future.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.604
Sad.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.853
Look, still alive.

34:27.401 --> 34:29.111
Change of heart?

34:29.278 --> 34:31.738
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

34:32.948 --> 34:34.408
You evil demoness!

34:38.453 --> 34:40.503
Let's go see my palace.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.701
Fear not, for you are found.

35:15.782 --> 35:17.742
You are home,
and there is no going back.

35:20.621 --> 35:23.121
No one leaves this place.

35:23.290 --> 35:24.960
But what is this place?

35:25.125 --> 35:28.335
The answer is Sakaar.

35:30.214 --> 35:31.674
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

35:32.549 --> 35:35.389
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.

35:35.552 --> 35:39.102
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.

35:39.264 --> 35:40.974
Like you.

35:41.141 --> 35:43.891
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

35:44.061 --> 35:45.561
You are valuable.

35:45.729 --> 35:47.109
Here you are loved.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.272
What the hell?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.570
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.

35:51.735 --> 35:55.905
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.

35:56.073 --> 35:57.243
The creator of Sakaar,

35:57.407 --> 36:00.657
and father of the Contest of Champions.

36:00.827 --> 36:05.117
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.

36:05.290 --> 36:08.460
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

36:08.627 --> 36:10.087
Congratulations!

36:10.254 --> 36:13.764
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.

36:14.132 --> 36:15.512
Prepare yourself.

36:17.261 --> 36:18.511
Prepare yourself.

36:20.305 --> 36:23.595
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

36:36.363 --> 36:38.623
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

36:38.824 --> 36:40.084
It is a he.

36:40.242 --> 36:41.242
Yeah.

36:41.326 --> 36:43.326
I love when you come to visit, 142.

36:43.412 --> 36:45.042
You bring me the best stuff.

36:45.205 --> 36:48.745
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,

36:48.917 --> 36:52.457
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

36:52.629 --> 36:53.669
Trash.

36:54.673 --> 36:56.553
No, not trash.

36:57.342 --> 37:00.392
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."

37:00.554 --> 37:01.684
Booze hag.

37:04.349 --> 37:06.689
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

37:06.852 --> 37:08.062
'Cause I always say you're the best.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.148
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.114
You say that every time she's here.

37:12.274 --> 37:13.444
What have you brought today? Tell me.

37:13.901 --> 37:14.901
A contender.

37:15.068 --> 37:16.148
A what?

37:16.320 --> 37:18.320
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.

37:18.488 --> 37:20.448
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.003
Pay this lady.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.921
Just wait a damn minute.

37:36.089 --> 37:38.509
I'm not for sale.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.393
Man, he's a fighter.

37:46.558 --> 37:47.888
I take 10 million.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.100
Tell her she's dreaming.

37:49.269 --> 37:51.229
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

37:58.237 --> 37:59.817
You'll pay for this.

37:59.988 --> 38:01.358
No, I got paid for this.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.740
Here's what I wanna know.

38:06.411 --> 38:07.411
Who are you?

38:07.496 --> 38:11.666
I am the God of Thunder.

38:14.878 --> 38:18.338
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?

38:18.924 --> 38:20.884
We've located your cousin.

38:21.802 --> 38:22.892
Good!

38:23.053 --> 38:25.223
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.

38:25.389 --> 38:26.389
There he is.

38:26.473 --> 38:27.723
Hey, cuz.

38:28.225 --> 38:30.605
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

38:30.769 --> 38:31.769
Hi.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.690
So...

38:34.857 --> 38:35.937
Please.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.150
I'm sorry.

38:38.318 --> 38:39.488
Yeah.

38:39.653 --> 38:40.903
Carlo...

38:42.030 --> 38:43.240
I pardon you.

38:43.407 --> 38:44.777
Thank you.

38:44.950 --> 38:45.950
Thank you.

38:46.285 --> 38:49.165
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

38:54.877 --> 38:56.127
Help me.

38:56.962 --> 38:59.592
Oh, my God!

38:59.756 --> 39:01.756
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

39:04.136 --> 39:05.716
The smell.

39:06.138 --> 39:07.348
What does it smell like?

39:07.514 --> 39:08.724
Burnt toast.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.556
What happened to my manners?

39:11.852 --> 39:13.402
I haven't properly introduced myself.

39:13.562 --> 39:15.482
Come on. Follow me.

39:15.898 --> 39:17.898
My name is Grandmaster.

39:18.066 --> 39:21.486
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.

39:21.653 --> 39:24.363
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.

39:24.531 --> 39:27.241
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.

39:27.409 --> 39:28.409
What do you say to that?

39:28.493 --> 39:30.663
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.076
I'm going back to Asgard.

39:32.289 --> 39:33.749
Ass-gard.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.337
One, two, three, four.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.955
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

39:41.131 --> 39:44.051
At that moment, I let go.

39:44.510 --> 39:45.640
Loki?

39:46.929 --> 39:48.639
Loki! Loki!

39:48.805 --> 39:50.675
Over here. Over here.

39:52.267 --> 39:53.637
-Excuse me one second.
-Loki!

39:55.521 --> 39:56.601
-What?
-You're alive?

39:56.772 --> 39:58.572
-Yes, of course I'm alive.
-What are you doing here?

39:58.732 --> 40:00.732
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

40:00.901 --> 40:02.441
-Where's your chair?
-I didn't get a chair.

40:02.611 --> 40:04.201
-Get me out of this one. Get me out.
-I can't.

40:04.363 --> 40:05.573
-I can't.
-What?

40:05.739 --> 40:07.279
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.

40:07.449 --> 40:08.779
-He's crazy!
-I've gained his favor.

40:08.951 --> 40:10.541
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.

40:10.702 --> 40:11.832
-Weeks ago?
-Yes.

40:11.995 --> 40:12.995
I just got here.

40:13.163 --> 40:14.253
What are you whispering about?

40:15.457 --> 40:17.207
Time works real different
around these parts.

40:17.376 --> 40:20.416
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.

40:20.587 --> 40:22.207
But here on Sakaar...

40:27.636 --> 40:30.306
In any case, you know this...

40:30.472 --> 40:31.722
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

40:31.890 --> 40:34.230
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

40:34.393 --> 40:36.063
I've never met this man in my life.

40:36.228 --> 40:37.848
-He's my brother.
-Adopted.

40:38.021 --> 40:39.151
Is he any kind of a fighter?

40:39.648 --> 40:41.438
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.

40:41.608 --> 40:43.318
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

40:43.485 --> 40:45.445
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.862
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...

40:47.948 --> 40:48.948
Asgard.

40:49.032 --> 40:52.122
Any contender who defeats my champion,

40:52.202 --> 40:54.042
their freedom they shall win.

40:54.204 --> 40:57.424
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

40:57.583 --> 41:00.133
That's what I call, contender.

41:00.294 --> 41:02.714
Direction would be this way, Lord.

41:03.422 --> 41:04.422
Loki!

41:10.596 --> 41:12.256
Hey. Take it easy, man.

41:13.932 --> 41:14.932
Over here.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.690
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

41:16.852 --> 41:19.402
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

41:19.563 --> 41:20.563
Allow me to introduce myself.

41:20.647 --> 41:22.647
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

41:22.816 --> 41:26.236
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.

41:26.403 --> 41:29.323
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.779
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.700
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.

41:34.870 --> 41:37.620
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

41:38.248 --> 41:39.708
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

41:39.875 --> 41:42.465
-That I am.
-How'd you end up in here?

41:42.628 --> 41:45.588
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

41:45.756 --> 41:49.926
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

41:50.093 --> 41:53.933
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.

41:54.097 --> 41:55.557
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

41:55.724 --> 41:58.444
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.522
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.607
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

42:04.775 --> 42:05.865
How did you...

42:06.026 --> 42:08.736
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

42:08.904 --> 42:12.074
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

42:12.241 --> 42:14.911
-This doesn't make any sense.
-No, nothing makes sense here, man.

42:15.077 --> 42:18.077
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.

42:18.247 --> 42:20.577
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

42:20.749 --> 42:21.829
Doug has.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Doug!

42:23.168 --> 42:24.338
Our luck, Doug's dead.

42:24.503 --> 42:25.503
That's right.

42:25.587 --> 42:28.007
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

42:28.090 --> 42:29.760
What about you? You're made of rocks.

42:29.925 --> 42:32.595
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.

42:32.761 --> 42:36.601
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

42:36.765 --> 42:38.515
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?

42:38.684 --> 42:40.144
Yes, I am.

42:40.310 --> 42:43.560
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.

42:44.189 --> 42:46.109
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

42:46.275 --> 42:48.115
See you later, new Doug.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.661
Does no one remember me?

43:00.330 --> 43:02.790
Has no one been taught our history?

43:08.380 --> 43:09.840
Look at these lies.

43:10.549 --> 43:12.009
Goblets and garden parties?

43:14.219 --> 43:15.889
Peace treaties?

43:16.680 --> 43:17.930
Odin...

43:18.098 --> 43:19.718
Proud to have it,

43:19.892 --> 43:21.272
ashamed of how he got it.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.620
We were unstoppable.

43:42.789 --> 43:47.379
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

43:50.130 --> 43:53.510
One by one, the realms became ours.

43:53.675 --> 43:57.885
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,

43:58.055 --> 44:02.735
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

44:02.976 --> 44:05.766
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,

44:05.938 --> 44:09.568
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

44:20.702 --> 44:22.502
-Odin's treasures.
-Fake.

44:24.665 --> 44:27.215
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

44:27.793 --> 44:29.003
Or weak.

44:31.088 --> 44:33.088
Smaller than I thought it would be.

44:34.174 --> 44:36.054
That's not bad.

44:36.218 --> 44:37.508
But this...

44:38.095 --> 44:40.225
The Eternal Flame.

45:08.375 --> 45:10.625
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

45:39.573 --> 45:42.243
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

45:44.703 --> 45:48.793
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

46:04.389 --> 46:06.309
I've missed you.

46:07.142 --> 46:09.062
I've missed you all.

46:11.772 --> 46:12.812
Odin,

46:13.065 --> 46:16.365
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,

46:16.527 --> 46:18.897
where the brave shall live forever.

46:20.322 --> 46:22.742
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

46:22.908 --> 46:25.618
for those that have died
the glorious death.

46:33.669 --> 46:35.089
Hurts, doesn't it?

46:35.254 --> 46:36.254
Being lied to.

46:37.297 --> 46:40.717
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.

46:45.556 --> 46:47.556
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?

46:47.724 --> 46:49.484
This place is disgusting.

46:52.354 --> 46:54.234
Does this mean you don't want my help?

46:54.398 --> 46:56.398
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.

46:56.567 --> 46:59.527
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

46:59.695 --> 47:02.955
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.

47:03.115 --> 47:07.745
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

47:13.917 --> 47:16.287
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

47:18.589 --> 47:22.719
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.

47:23.635 --> 47:25.425
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

47:25.596 --> 47:27.006
You don't stand a chance.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.351
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?

47:33.770 --> 47:34.850
Fine.

47:37.482 --> 47:40.072
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

47:40.986 --> 47:41.986
Like I've always done.

47:44.990 --> 47:46.280
Would you say something?

47:48.952 --> 47:50.502
Say something!

47:51.622 --> 47:53.832
What would you like me to say?

47:54.208 --> 47:56.418
You faked your own death,

47:56.585 --> 47:59.095
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,

47:59.254 --> 48:02.554
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.

48:03.050 --> 48:06.430
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?

48:08.055 --> 48:11.645
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,

48:11.808 --> 48:13.808
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.190
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.

48:18.440 --> 48:19.570
Don't let me down.

48:23.529 --> 48:25.029
Piss off, ghost!

48:27.491 --> 48:29.081
He's freaking gone.

48:37.376 --> 48:38.376
Yuck!

48:38.544 --> 48:40.594
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.

48:40.754 --> 48:43.474
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?

48:43.632 --> 48:44.632
Disgusting slobs.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.430
Thor,

48:47.594 --> 48:49.604
wanna use a big wooden fork?

48:50.097 --> 48:51.097
No.

48:51.181 --> 48:52.351
Yeah, not really useful.

48:52.474 --> 48:55.984
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.

48:56.645 --> 48:58.315
I really wish I had my hammer.

48:58.730 --> 48:59.730
Hammer?

48:59.815 --> 49:00.825
Quite unique.

49:00.899 --> 49:03.609
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.

49:04.152 --> 49:06.952
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.

49:07.114 --> 49:08.244
You rode a hammer?

49:08.407 --> 49:09.947
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

49:10.117 --> 49:11.407
The hammer rode you on your back?

49:11.577 --> 49:14.947
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...

49:15.122 --> 49:17.122
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

49:17.291 --> 49:21.001
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.

49:21.170 --> 49:24.170
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.

49:24.339 --> 49:27.009
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer

49:27.176 --> 49:30.296
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

49:31.221 --> 49:33.431
That's a nice way of putting it.

49:35.058 --> 49:36.428
I said they're mine.

49:37.769 --> 49:39.769
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.

49:39.938 --> 49:42.108
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

49:42.274 --> 49:44.324
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

49:44.484 --> 49:46.154
They are hard to perish.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.780
Asgardian?

49:49.323 --> 49:50.323
Hey.

49:50.532 --> 49:51.532
Hey.

49:52.201 --> 49:53.201
Hey.

49:53.660 --> 49:56.080
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

49:57.831 --> 49:59.251
Asgard is in danger.

50:03.712 --> 50:05.302
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

50:06.757 --> 50:08.467
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,

50:08.634 --> 50:10.974
until I found out that
you were all women.

50:11.136 --> 50:13.296
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.

50:13.472 --> 50:15.022
Sometimes a little too much.

50:15.182 --> 50:18.182
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.

50:18.352 --> 50:22.812
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.

50:22.981 --> 50:24.481
It's about time.

50:26.068 --> 50:27.068
Are you done?

50:27.152 --> 50:28.152
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

50:28.237 --> 50:29.277
Please, help me. I need your help.

50:29.363 --> 50:30.363
Bye.

50:30.531 --> 50:32.701
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.

50:32.866 --> 50:35.196
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.

50:35.911 --> 50:39.211
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

50:39.373 --> 50:41.213
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

50:44.503 --> 50:46.423
Bring him in for processing.

50:46.588 --> 50:50.468
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

51:02.354 --> 51:03.944
Now, don't you move.

51:04.106 --> 51:06.726
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

51:06.900 --> 51:09.900
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,

51:10.070 --> 51:12.490
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

51:16.910 --> 51:19.410
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

51:20.664 --> 51:22.044
Please! No!

51:22.207 --> 51:23.327
No!

51:35.554 --> 51:39.894
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!

51:40.058 --> 51:41.058
Who's having fun?

51:42.227 --> 51:44.187
Please, I'm your host.

51:44.354 --> 51:47.574
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,

51:47.733 --> 51:50.533
who today died so gruesomely.

51:50.694 --> 51:51.904
Good sports.

51:52.070 --> 51:53.740
What a show! What a night!

51:54.698 --> 51:58.118
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.

52:03.790 --> 52:06.790
And now, without further ado,

52:06.960 --> 52:09.460
it's main event time.

52:11.173 --> 52:14.513
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,

52:14.676 --> 52:16.506
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

52:17.095 --> 52:19.715
I'll say no more, see what you think.

52:19.890 --> 52:21.220
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

52:22.392 --> 52:24.602
Lord of Thunder.

52:47.918 --> 52:50.628
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.

52:50.796 --> 52:51.916
Okay, this is it.

52:52.089 --> 52:54.919
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.

53:03.851 --> 53:05.311
He is a creature.

53:05.477 --> 53:07.187
What can we say about him?

53:07.354 --> 53:09.234
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.

53:09.398 --> 53:12.148
I feel a special connection with him.

53:13.694 --> 53:14.944
He's undefeated.

53:16.530 --> 53:17.950
He's the reigning.

53:20.325 --> 53:22.485
He's the defending.

53:22.911 --> 53:24.041
Ladies and gentlemen...

53:24.204 --> 53:25.254
I give you...

53:30.210 --> 53:33.960
Your Incredible...

53:37.718 --> 53:39.428
Hulk!

53:40.179 --> 53:41.509
Yes!

53:45.434 --> 53:47.394
I have to get off this planet.

53:48.020 --> 53:49.900
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

53:57.988 --> 53:59.278
Hey!

53:59.990 --> 54:01.240
We know each other.

54:01.700 --> 54:03.700
He's a friend from work.

54:12.878 --> 54:14.298
Where have you been?

54:14.463 --> 54:16.593
Everybody thought you were dead.

54:16.757 --> 54:18.757
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

54:19.551 --> 54:20.971
I lost my hammer.

54:21.136 --> 54:24.176
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

54:24.348 --> 54:26.678
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

54:26.850 --> 54:27.930
He's up there.

54:28.101 --> 54:30.151
Loki! Look who it is!

54:32.272 --> 54:34.442
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,

54:34.608 --> 54:36.858
but I'm happy to see you.

54:37.027 --> 54:39.527
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

54:45.494 --> 54:46.494
Banner.

54:47.454 --> 54:48.834
Hey, Banner!

54:49.248 --> 54:51.368
No Banner. Only Hulk.

54:51.750 --> 54:53.250
What are you doing?

54:53.418 --> 54:54.918
It's me. It's Thor!

55:15.107 --> 55:16.397
Banner, we're friends.

55:16.567 --> 55:17.647
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

55:25.450 --> 55:27.490
Here we go.

55:46.346 --> 55:47.466
What?

55:57.941 --> 55:59.441
Hey, big guy.

56:01.278 --> 56:03.318
The sun's getting real low.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.921
That's it.
The sun's going down.

56:19.671 --> 56:21.631
I won't hurt you anymore.

56:21.798 --> 56:23.338
No one will.

56:35.145 --> 56:36.145
Yes!

56:36.230 --> 56:37.360
That's how it feels!

56:38.774 --> 56:40.614
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

56:48.325 --> 56:50.745
All right. Screw it.

57:02.381 --> 57:04.671
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!

57:13.934 --> 57:15.894
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

57:16.061 --> 57:17.271
I told them we were friends!

58:49.446 --> 58:51.526
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

58:53.325 --> 58:58.205
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

59:29.778 --> 59:32.488
Another day, another Doug.

59:41.373 --> 59:43.673
What is that noise?

59:43.834 --> 59:46.594
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

59:46.753 --> 59:50.553
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.

59:56.096 --> 59:57.966
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

59:58.140 --> 1:00:00.680
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

1:00:00.851 --> 1:00:04.731
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,

1:00:04.897 --> 1:00:06.517
what's your ambition?

1:00:07.649 --> 1:00:11.069
I just want a chance to prove myself.

1:00:11.653 --> 1:00:12.783
Recognition.

1:00:12.946 --> 1:00:14.316
When I was young,

1:00:14.489 --> 1:00:18.119
every great king had an executioner.

1:00:18.285 --> 1:00:20.335
Not just to execute people,

1:00:20.495 --> 1:00:23.075
but also to execute their vision.

1:00:24.124 --> 1:00:26.924
But mainly to execute people.

1:00:27.085 --> 1:00:29.085
Still, it was a great honor.

1:00:30.923 --> 1:00:33.723
I was Odin's executioner.

1:00:34.801 --> 1:00:39.061
And you shall be my executioner.

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:46.520
Let's begin our conquest.

1:00:57.908 --> 1:00:59.528
Skurge, where's the sword?

1:01:04.998 --> 1:01:08.668
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

1:01:09.044 --> 1:01:12.634
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...

1:01:13.298 --> 1:01:14.508
Round them up.

1:01:38.198 --> 1:01:39.198
Excuse me.

1:01:51.712 --> 1:01:54.712
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.

1:01:55.924 --> 1:01:57.014
Come on.

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:33.630
You'll be safe here.

1:03:43.198 --> 1:03:44.198
Are we cool?

1:03:47.870 --> 1:03:49.540
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

1:03:50.831 --> 1:03:52.421
So how long
have you been like that?

1:03:52.833 --> 1:03:54.133
Like what?

1:03:54.877 --> 1:03:58.047
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

1:03:59.173 --> 1:04:01.343
Hulk always Hulk.

1:04:05.971 --> 1:04:07.391
How'd you get here?

1:04:08.182 --> 1:04:09.222
Winning.

1:04:10.017 --> 1:04:11.057
You mean cheating?

1:04:11.226 --> 1:04:13.436
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?

1:04:13.604 --> 1:04:14.904
How'd you arrive here?

1:04:17.941 --> 1:04:18.981
Quinjet.

1:04:19.067 --> 1:04:21.647
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

1:04:26.366 --> 1:04:28.366
That's naked.

1:04:28.535 --> 1:04:30.245
He's very naked.

1:04:33.999 --> 1:04:36.169
It's in my brain now.

1:04:36.793 --> 1:04:38.043
Quinjet.

1:04:48.514 --> 1:04:49.894
Yes!

1:04:50.057 --> 1:04:51.557
I'm getting us out of here.

1:04:51.725 --> 1:04:54.135
This terrible, awful place.

1:04:54.311 --> 1:04:58.021
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

1:04:58.190 --> 1:04:59.570
Hulk stay.

1:04:59.733 --> 1:05:03.153
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

1:05:03.862 --> 1:05:05.662
We must prevent Ragnarok.

1:05:05.822 --> 1:05:06.992
Ragnarok?

1:05:07.157 --> 1:05:10.537
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...

1:05:12.579 --> 1:05:14.749
If you help me get back to Asgard,

1:05:14.915 --> 1:05:17.085
I can help you get back to Earth.

1:05:17.251 --> 1:05:18.251
Earth hate Hulk.

1:05:18.418 --> 1:05:19.998
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

1:05:20.170 --> 1:05:22.880
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.

1:05:23.549 --> 1:05:25.299
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

1:05:25.467 --> 1:05:26.627
You're Banner's friend.

1:05:26.802 --> 1:05:29.012
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

1:05:29.179 --> 1:05:30.179
Banner's friend.

1:05:30.264 --> 1:05:31.314
I don't even like Banner.

1:05:31.390 --> 1:05:34.270
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."

1:05:34.685 --> 1:05:36.395
Thor go. Hulk stay.

1:05:36.562 --> 1:05:37.562
Fine.

1:05:38.272 --> 1:05:39.402
Stay here.

1:05:40.774 --> 1:05:42.484
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

1:05:42.651 --> 1:05:46.111
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.

1:05:46.905 --> 1:05:48.155
Smash you.

1:05:48.323 --> 1:05:50.623
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

1:05:50.784 --> 1:05:52.914
-I smashed you.
-Yeah, sure, sure.

1:05:53.078 --> 1:05:54.828
-Baby arms.
-What?

1:05:54.997 --> 1:05:55.997
Baby.

1:05:56.248 --> 1:05:57.788
Moron! You big child.

1:05:57.958 --> 1:05:58.958
Thor go!

1:05:59.042 --> 1:06:00.292
I am going.

1:06:05.007 --> 1:06:06.467
Thor go again.

1:06:11.138 --> 1:06:12.428
Thor home.

1:06:22.566 --> 1:06:24.146
Hulk trains.

1:06:24.318 --> 1:06:26.398
That's great. Have fun.

1:06:26.570 --> 1:06:28.200
-Hey, big guy.
-Angry girl.

1:06:28.363 --> 1:06:29.663
What have you been up to?

1:06:29.823 --> 1:06:30.823
Winning.

1:06:41.210 --> 1:06:44.420
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

1:06:45.756 --> 1:06:47.756
I need you to help me.

1:06:49.885 --> 1:06:51.225
Help me see.

1:07:01.396 --> 1:07:03.896
I see you, but you're far away.

1:07:04.816 --> 1:07:06.066
What's going on here?

1:07:06.235 --> 1:07:07.615
Come see for yourself.

1:07:10.322 --> 1:07:13.122
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.

1:07:13.283 --> 1:07:16.703
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

1:07:16.870 --> 1:07:18.910
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.130
We won't last long if we stay.

1:07:24.628 --> 1:07:27.298
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.

1:07:27.464 --> 1:07:28.594
Come on.

1:07:32.553 --> 1:07:34.053
Hela is ravenous.

1:07:34.221 --> 1:07:37.271
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

1:07:37.474 --> 1:07:38.484
We need you.

1:07:38.642 --> 1:07:41.022
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.

1:07:41.186 --> 1:07:43.356
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

1:07:43.522 --> 1:07:45.442
-Which one?
-The big one.

1:08:14.595 --> 1:08:15.895
Thor sad.

1:08:16.054 --> 1:08:17.264
Shut up.

1:08:19.516 --> 1:08:21.176
Thor sad.

1:08:22.227 --> 1:08:24.017
I'm not sad, you idiot.

1:08:24.438 --> 1:08:25.688
I'm pissed off!

1:08:27.149 --> 1:08:29.779
Angry. I lost my father.

1:08:30.944 --> 1:08:32.244
I lost my hammer.

1:08:33.405 --> 1:08:36.275
-Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
-You're not even listening.

1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:38.280
Don't kick stuff.

1:08:39.578 --> 1:08:41.748
You're being a really bad friend.

1:08:41.914 --> 1:08:43.124
You bad friend!

1:08:43.290 --> 1:08:44.500
-You know what we call you?
-No.

1:08:44.666 --> 1:08:46.456
We call you the stupid Avenger.

1:08:46.627 --> 1:08:48.547
You're tiny Avenger!

1:08:51.256 --> 1:08:52.416
What, are you crazy?

1:08:52.591 --> 1:08:53.591
Yes.

1:08:53.675 --> 1:08:56.215
You know what? Earth does hate you.

1:09:16.823 --> 1:09:17.873
No.

1:09:21.286 --> 1:09:23.956
I'm sorry I said those things.

1:09:24.706 --> 1:09:28.336
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

1:09:28.919 --> 1:09:30.379
It's okay.

1:09:30.546 --> 1:09:32.956
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.

1:09:33.131 --> 1:09:35.841
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.

1:09:36.009 --> 1:09:38.139
Hulk always, always angry.

1:09:38.303 --> 1:09:40.643
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

1:09:41.139 --> 1:09:42.719
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

1:09:42.891 --> 1:09:46.851
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

1:09:47.771 --> 1:09:49.481
We're kind of both like fire.

1:09:49.648 --> 1:09:51.648
But Hulk like real fire.

1:09:52.693 --> 1:09:55.033
Hulk like raging fire.

1:09:55.195 --> 1:09:57.445
Thor like smoldering fire.

1:09:59.950 --> 1:10:01.790
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

1:10:08.375 --> 1:10:09.875
Angry girl.

1:10:17.217 --> 1:10:19.467
What's going on? What are you...

1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.360
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell

1:10:30.522 --> 1:10:33.362
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?

1:10:33.525 --> 1:10:36.145
-We need to talk.
-No, you wanna talk to me.

1:10:36.904 --> 1:10:37.954
I need her to stay.

1:10:38.113 --> 1:10:39.113
Stay?

1:10:39.740 --> 1:10:40.870
Block.

1:10:42.534 --> 1:10:43.544
Stay.

1:10:44.244 --> 1:10:46.084
-Please.
-Please.

1:10:48.957 --> 1:10:49.957
All right.

1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:53.800
Here's the deal.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.089
I'll listen to you

1:10:56.798 --> 1:10:58.168
till this is empty.

1:10:59.635 --> 1:11:01.895
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.

1:11:02.054 --> 1:11:03.644
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1:11:05.682 --> 1:11:07.602
Finished. Bye.

1:11:09.228 --> 1:11:10.598
Odin is dead.

1:11:13.982 --> 1:11:16.232
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1:11:17.027 --> 1:11:19.607
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:21.280
I'm going to stop her.

1:11:22.032 --> 1:11:23.122
-Alone?
-Nope.

1:11:23.283 --> 1:11:24.663
I'm putting together a team.

1:11:24.826 --> 1:11:27.576
It's me, you, and the big guy.

1:11:27.955 --> 1:11:30.175
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1:11:30.332 --> 1:11:32.002
It's me and you.

1:11:32.167 --> 1:11:33.287
I think it's only you.

1:11:33.460 --> 1:11:35.670
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1:11:35.838 --> 1:11:38.298
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1:11:39.049 --> 1:11:41.299
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.

1:11:41.885 --> 1:11:43.635
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your sister.

1:11:43.804 --> 1:11:45.724
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1:11:45.889 --> 1:11:48.389
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace

1:11:48.559 --> 1:11:50.059
and tried to seize the throne.

1:11:50.477 --> 1:11:52.187
When she tried
to escape her banishment

1:11:52.354 --> 1:11:54.734
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

1:11:55.899 --> 1:11:58.029
I only survived because...

1:11:59.611 --> 1:12:02.991
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,

1:12:03.156 --> 1:12:04.406
and it cost me everything.

1:12:04.783 --> 1:12:06.533
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

1:12:06.702 --> 1:12:08.752
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1:12:08.912 --> 1:12:10.212
I agree.

1:12:11.123 --> 1:12:12.543
Don't get familiar.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.380
I agree.

1:12:14.543 --> 1:12:16.043
That's why I turned down the throne.

1:12:16.211 --> 1:12:19.341
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.

1:12:19.506 --> 1:12:21.506
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

1:12:21.675 --> 1:12:22.675
Forget it.

1:12:23.969 --> 1:12:25.349
I have.

1:12:25.512 --> 1:12:26.722
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:12:26.889 --> 1:12:28.099
-Good. Great.
-Great.

1:12:28.265 --> 1:12:29.275
Thank you.

1:12:29.349 --> 1:12:31.019
-For what?
-For this.

1:12:33.353 --> 1:12:34.563
Didn't see that, did you?

1:12:36.064 --> 1:12:38.194
There... That's better.

1:12:39.943 --> 1:12:41.703
You know, go ahead.

1:12:41.862 --> 1:12:46.372
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

1:12:46.533 --> 1:12:47.913
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1:12:48.076 --> 1:12:49.286
But me...

1:12:51.371 --> 1:12:54.501
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.

1:12:55.584 --> 1:12:56.844
Because that's what...

1:13:01.882 --> 1:13:04.012
Because that's what heroes do.

1:13:15.479 --> 1:13:16.899
Friend stay!

1:13:28.909 --> 1:13:30.239
Yes!

1:13:44.883 --> 1:13:45.883
All right.

1:13:49.763 --> 1:13:50.763

1:14:15.497 --> 1:14:17.707
Welcome, Point Break.

1:14:19.877 --> 1:14:21.247
Friend stay!

1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:22.420
No, no, no!

1:14:22.504 --> 1:14:23.554
Stop!

1:14:23.630 --> 1:14:24.630
Stay!

1:14:25.549 --> 1:14:26.929
Hulk, stop breaking everything!

1:14:27.092 --> 1:14:28.592
Don't go!

1:14:31.889 --> 1:14:33.179
Nice work, big guy.

1:14:33.348 --> 1:14:36.808
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.

1:14:36.977 --> 1:14:38.647
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?

1:14:39.396 --> 1:14:41.936
We can't track you in stealth mode,

1:14:42.107 --> 1:14:43.817
so I need you to help me out. Okay?

1:14:47.487 --> 1:14:49.027
I need you to...

1:15:05.255 --> 1:15:07.755
No! No, Banner!

1:15:14.932 --> 1:15:16.272
Oh, jeez.

1:15:17.184 --> 1:15:18.644
Banner.

1:15:19.811 --> 1:15:21.351
Hey, hey, hey.

1:15:21.522 --> 1:15:23.112
You all right, Banner?

1:15:25.526 --> 1:15:27.396
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.

1:15:27.819 --> 1:15:29.239
That's it, breathe.

1:15:30.447 --> 1:15:31.867
I won't hurt you.

1:15:32.449 --> 1:15:33.529
Sun's going down.

1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:35.120
-Thor.
-Yeah.

1:15:35.953 --> 1:15:37.333
What happened to your hair?

1:15:37.496 --> 1:15:38.826
Some creepy old man cut it off.

1:15:38.997 --> 1:15:40.457
-It looks good.
-Thanks.

1:15:40.624 --> 1:15:42.964
Where are we? How's Nat?

1:15:43.836 --> 1:15:46.086
-Nat is good, I'm sure.
-Is she okay?

1:15:46.296 --> 1:15:48.046
-And what about Sokovia?
-Sokovia?

1:15:48.215 --> 1:15:49.725
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?

1:15:49.883 --> 1:15:51.053
-Banner, listen.
-What?

1:15:51.218 --> 1:15:53.218
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.

1:15:53.387 --> 1:15:54.887
What are you saying?

1:15:55.055 --> 1:15:56.175
What?

1:15:56.974 --> 1:15:58.394
I've been Hulk for two years?

1:15:58.725 --> 1:16:00.225
I'm afraid so.

1:16:06.191 --> 1:16:07.401
What the hell happened?

1:16:10.821 --> 1:16:12.491
Banner, there's something
you should know.

1:16:14.867 --> 1:16:15.947
Voice activation required.

1:16:16.118 --> 1:16:17.118
Banner.

1:16:17.286 --> 1:16:18.826
Welcome, strongest Avenger.

1:16:18.996 --> 1:16:19.996
What?

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:21.120
Ship's log.

1:16:32.551 --> 1:16:34.141
Thor, where are we?

1:16:34.303 --> 1:16:35.353
Yeah, about that.

1:16:35.512 --> 1:16:38.642
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.

1:16:38.807 --> 1:16:41.597
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.

1:16:41.768 --> 1:16:44.188
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

1:16:44.354 --> 1:16:45.364
Who's that?

1:16:45.439 --> 1:16:47.069
He kind of runs the place.

1:16:47.774 --> 1:16:49.114
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.

1:16:49.276 --> 1:16:50.316
-I did?
-Yeah.

1:16:50.485 --> 1:16:52.395
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.

1:16:53.113 --> 1:16:54.993
-Did I win?
-No, I won. Easily.

1:16:55.157 --> 1:16:56.157
Doesn't sound right.

1:16:56.241 --> 1:16:57.281
Well, it's true.

1:16:57.367 --> 1:17:02.037
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.

1:17:02.206 --> 1:17:04.706
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1:17:05.459 --> 1:17:06.459
Oh, no.

1:17:08.337 --> 1:17:09.457
This is bad.

1:17:09.630 --> 1:17:11.670
This is really, really bad.

1:17:14.384 --> 1:17:18.104
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1:17:18.555 --> 1:17:19.555
No, no, no.

1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:21.560
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1:17:21.725 --> 1:17:22.765
These are Tony's clothes.

1:17:22.935 --> 1:17:24.235
-I know, come on.
-Is he here?

1:17:24.394 --> 1:17:26.274
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?

1:17:26.438 --> 1:17:29.818
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.

1:17:37.407 --> 1:17:39.277
I'm upset!

1:17:42.287 --> 1:17:44.157
I'm very upset.

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:46.421
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.

1:17:46.583 --> 1:17:49.963
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?

1:17:50.128 --> 1:17:51.668
-Grandmaster, I can...
-Hey!

1:17:51.839 --> 1:17:52.879
Don't interrupt me!

1:17:52.965 --> 1:17:54.055
Here you go.

1:17:54.758 --> 1:17:56.178
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1:17:56.343 --> 1:17:58.183
He was interrupting.

1:17:58.345 --> 1:18:00.095
That's not a capital violation.

1:18:00.264 --> 1:18:01.644
Where was I?

1:18:02.015 --> 1:18:04.475
My precious champion
has come up missing,

1:18:04.643 --> 1:18:07.903
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.

1:18:08.063 --> 1:18:09.063
Your brother.

1:18:09.147 --> 1:18:12.067
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.

1:18:12.234 --> 1:18:13.234
I'm sure there's a big history.

1:18:13.402 --> 1:18:14.572
And your contender...

1:18:15.362 --> 1:18:16.362
My dear friend,

1:18:16.530 --> 1:18:19.820
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.

1:18:19.992 --> 1:18:21.492
I could do it in two.

1:18:22.369 --> 1:18:23.449
I could do it in one.

1:18:23.620 --> 1:18:24.660
Let's stop there.

1:18:24.830 --> 1:18:28.500
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.

1:18:29.376 --> 1:18:30.496
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little

1:18:30.752 --> 1:18:33.552
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1:18:34.798 --> 1:18:37.128
So, you're on the clock.

1:18:39.052 --> 1:18:40.142
What have you done?

1:18:40.304 --> 1:18:41.554
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1:18:41.722 --> 1:18:42.722
It's Loki.

1:18:42.806 --> 1:18:44.466
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1:18:47.561 --> 1:18:50.481
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?

1:18:50.647 --> 1:18:52.017
I don't help anyone.

1:18:58.530 --> 1:18:59.660
You're a Valkyrie.

1:19:04.578 --> 1:19:06.788
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.

1:19:07.956 --> 1:19:09.666
Choose your next words wisely.

1:19:09.833 --> 1:19:13.133
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1:20:05.764 --> 1:20:08.354
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1:20:09.518 --> 1:20:11.098
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.

1:20:11.186 --> 1:20:12.436
Oh, shoot.

1:20:12.604 --> 1:20:14.734
-Sun's getting low.
-Would you stop saying that?

1:20:14.898 --> 1:20:16.068
I just need you to stay calm.

1:20:16.233 --> 1:20:18.153
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1:20:18.318 --> 1:20:20.068
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.

1:20:20.237 --> 1:20:21.277
Yeah. One.

1:20:21.446 --> 1:20:23.066
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:24.450
It's a new experience.

1:20:24.616 --> 1:20:28.696
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.

1:20:28.871 --> 1:20:31.121
The whole thing
is totally different this time.

1:20:31.290 --> 1:20:34.580
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.

1:20:34.751 --> 1:20:38.171
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1:20:38.338 --> 1:20:40.168
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:41.420
No, it's not what matters.

1:20:41.592 --> 1:20:44.342
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,

1:20:44.511 --> 1:20:46.011
Banner may never come back.

1:20:46.180 --> 1:20:49.470
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.

1:20:49.641 --> 1:20:52.191
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.

1:20:52.644 --> 1:20:53.654
Thank you.

1:20:53.729 --> 1:20:55.939
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1:20:56.106 --> 1:20:57.146
What?

1:20:57.316 --> 1:20:59.106
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1:20:59.526 --> 1:21:01.776
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,

1:21:01.945 --> 1:21:03.775
who also happens to be my sister.

1:21:03.947 --> 1:21:05.657
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1:21:05.824 --> 1:21:08.334
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.

1:21:08.493 --> 1:21:09.873
No, she's an evil being.

1:21:10.037 --> 1:21:11.407
I don't care what she is.

1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:13.920
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.

1:21:14.082 --> 1:21:15.172
-What?
-I just told you.

1:21:15.334 --> 1:21:18.134
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.

1:21:18.295 --> 1:21:19.345
And you don't care.

1:21:19.505 --> 1:21:21.305
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1:21:21.465 --> 1:21:22.805
The Hulk is the fire.

1:21:22.966 --> 1:21:24.716
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1:21:24.885 --> 1:21:26.435
-What? No!
-It's gross.

1:21:26.595 --> 1:21:28.355
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1:21:28.514 --> 1:21:31.604
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...

1:21:31.767 --> 1:21:33.267
"Smash, smash, smash."

1:21:33.435 --> 1:21:34.635
I prefer you.

1:21:35.687 --> 1:21:36.687
Thanks.

1:21:37.189 --> 1:21:40.279
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,

1:21:40.442 --> 1:21:41.862
he is very powerful and useful.

1:21:42.027 --> 1:21:43.987
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1:21:44.154 --> 1:21:45.284
Is he though?

1:21:45.447 --> 1:21:47.567
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1:21:47.741 --> 1:21:49.661
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.

1:21:50.410 --> 1:21:52.410
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1:21:52.579 --> 1:21:54.539
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1:21:58.460 --> 1:21:59.540
What are you doing with that?

1:21:59.711 --> 1:22:00.711
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1:22:00.796 --> 1:22:02.626
-I need a disguise.
-You are the disguise.

1:22:03.298 --> 1:22:05.008
-I'll be Tony Stark.
-What?

1:22:05.175 --> 1:22:06.925
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1:22:07.094 --> 1:22:09.554
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1:22:09.721 --> 1:22:11.011
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1:22:11.181 --> 1:22:12.181
Because you were naked.

1:22:12.349 --> 1:22:13.729
Okay, I'll give you that.

1:22:14.393 --> 1:22:15.523
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1:22:15.686 --> 1:22:17.146
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1:22:17.312 --> 1:22:18.362
-Stop it!
-I'm sorry.

1:22:18.438 --> 1:22:20.568
-Why are you being so weird?
-I don't know.

1:22:20.732 --> 1:22:23.072
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years

1:22:23.235 --> 1:22:25.825
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1:22:25.988 --> 1:22:27.658
Hey. It's okay.

1:22:27.823 --> 1:22:30.203
You're good. Calm down. Come on.

1:22:30.367 --> 1:22:31.827
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

1:22:31.994 --> 1:22:34.124
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?

1:22:34.538 --> 1:22:35.538
All right.

1:22:43.338 --> 1:22:44.708
This is bad.

1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:50.180
Banner! Banner!

1:22:54.183 --> 1:22:55.313
Banner!

1:23:09.031 --> 1:23:10.071
Banner!

1:23:10.490 --> 1:23:11.700
Thor!

1:23:23.253 --> 1:23:24.253
Hi.

1:23:24.338 --> 1:23:25.338
Hi.

1:23:25.422 --> 1:23:26.632
I was gonna do that.

1:23:26.798 --> 1:23:28.088
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1:23:28.258 --> 1:23:30.258
That's good. What are you doing here?

1:23:31.136 --> 1:23:32.756
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1:23:32.930 --> 1:23:33.930
I got sidetracked.

1:23:34.473 --> 1:23:35.643
What's with the...

1:23:35.807 --> 1:23:37.057
It's my disguise.

1:23:37.226 --> 1:23:38.306
But I can see your face.

1:23:38.644 --> 1:23:40.404
Not when I do this, you can't.

1:23:41.021 --> 1:23:44.481
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

1:23:50.447 --> 1:23:53.237
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?

1:23:53.408 --> 1:23:54.948
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

1:23:55.118 --> 1:23:56.118
Who is this guy?

1:23:56.203 --> 1:23:57.253
-He's a friend.
-Who? Me?

1:23:57.329 --> 1:23:58.749
-I'm Bruce.
-I feel like I know you.

1:23:58.914 --> 1:24:01.124
I feel like I know you, too.

1:24:05.504 --> 1:24:08.634
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.

1:24:09.424 --> 1:24:13.144
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.

1:24:13.303 --> 1:24:16.603
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1:24:16.765 --> 1:24:17.845
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1:24:18.767 --> 1:24:20.187
But I don't wanna forget.

1:24:20.352 --> 1:24:21.982
I can't turn away anymore,

1:24:22.604 --> 1:24:24.404
so if I'm gonna die,

1:24:24.565 --> 1:24:27.735
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1:24:27.901 --> 1:24:29.491
-Good.
-Yeah.

1:24:29.653 --> 1:24:32.663
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.

1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:34.490
Has it got a name?

1:24:34.658 --> 1:24:37.448
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1:24:37.619 --> 1:24:38.619
Revengers?

1:24:38.787 --> 1:24:41.287
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1:24:43.041 --> 1:24:44.381
Do you want revenge?

1:24:45.043 --> 1:24:46.753
I'm undecided.

1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:47.920
Okay.

1:24:48.505 --> 1:24:50.335
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1:24:53.594 --> 1:24:55.604
Surprise.

1:25:02.519 --> 1:25:03.979
Just had to be sure.

1:25:07.608 --> 1:25:08.778
Hello, Bruce.

1:25:10.110 --> 1:25:13.200
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.

1:25:13.363 --> 1:25:14.573
Where are you at these days?

1:25:15.032 --> 1:25:16.912
It varies from moment to moment.

1:25:17.993 --> 1:25:19.543
Is that a Dragonfang?

1:25:19.703 --> 1:25:20.793
It is.

1:25:20.954 --> 1:25:22.124
My God.

1:25:22.998 --> 1:25:25.168
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1:25:25.250 --> 1:25:28.460
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.

1:25:28.629 --> 1:25:31.259
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1:25:31.423 --> 1:25:35.053
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.

1:25:35.219 --> 1:25:38.469
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1:25:38.639 --> 1:25:39.759
The Devil's Anus?

1:25:39.932 --> 1:25:41.062
Anus?

1:25:41.225 --> 1:25:42.235
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1:25:42.392 --> 1:25:44.272
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.

1:25:44.436 --> 1:25:46.266
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star

1:25:46.438 --> 1:25:48.898
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1:25:49.066 --> 1:25:51.856
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.

1:25:51.944 --> 1:25:52.994
She's right. We need one that can

1:25:53.070 --> 1:25:54.860
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

1:25:55.030 --> 1:25:56.780
And has an offline
power steering system

1:25:56.949 --> 1:25:59.699
that could also function
without the onboard computer.

1:25:59.868 --> 1:26:02.948
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1:26:03.121 --> 1:26:05.041
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1:26:05.207 --> 1:26:07.077
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1:26:07.251 --> 1:26:08.381
What do you say?

1:26:08.544 --> 1:26:11.004
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1:26:11.171 --> 1:26:12.381
Talk about an adventure.

1:26:12.965 --> 1:26:14.635
-We need a ship.
-Need a ship.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:16.890
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...

1:26:17.052 --> 1:26:18.512
I don't mean to impose...

1:26:21.765 --> 1:26:23.475
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1:26:24.059 --> 1:26:27.599
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.

1:26:27.771 --> 1:26:30.071
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.

1:26:30.232 --> 1:26:31.272
Heavens, no.

1:26:31.358 --> 1:26:32.858
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,

1:26:33.026 --> 1:26:34.986
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,

1:26:35.153 --> 1:26:38.413
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1:26:38.574 --> 1:26:41.164
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage

1:26:41.326 --> 1:26:43.076
without setting off any alarms?

1:26:43.245 --> 1:26:44.915
Yes, brother. I can.

1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:47.830
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.670
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago

1:26:49.835 --> 1:26:52.345
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1:26:52.504 --> 1:26:53.674
He did try to kill me.

1:26:53.839 --> 1:26:55.669
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1:26:55.841 --> 1:26:57.431
There was one time
when we were children,

1:26:57.593 --> 1:27:00.353
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.

1:27:00.512 --> 1:27:02.352
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,

1:27:02.514 --> 1:27:05.234
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1:27:05.392 --> 1:27:08.402
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1:27:08.896 --> 1:27:09.976
If we're boosting a ship

1:27:10.147 --> 1:27:11.727
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.

1:27:11.899 --> 1:27:13.319
Why not set the beast loose?

1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:14.440
Shut up.

1:27:14.610 --> 1:27:15.690
You guys have a beast?

1:27:15.861 --> 1:27:18.241
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1:27:18.447 --> 1:27:19.947
We're going to start a revolution.

1:27:20.449 --> 1:27:22.029
-Revolution?
-I'll explain later.

1:27:22.201 --> 1:27:24.491
-Who's this guy again?
-I'll explain later.

1:27:25.329 --> 1:27:28.789
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,

1:27:28.957 --> 1:27:30.247
or are they eggs?

1:27:31.543 --> 1:27:32.793
Looks like eggs.

1:27:42.179 --> 1:27:43.599
I'm looking for Korg.

1:27:43.764 --> 1:27:45.064
Who's asking?

1:27:45.224 --> 1:27:46.394
I know you're asking.

1:27:46.558 --> 1:27:48.558
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1:27:48.727 --> 1:27:50.937
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1:27:54.441 --> 1:27:56.531
The revolution has begun.

1:27:56.777 --> 1:27:58.817
Revolution? How did this happen?

1:27:58.987 --> 1:28:00.487
Don't know.

1:28:00.656 --> 1:28:03.826
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated

1:28:03.992 --> 1:28:05.872
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1:28:06.537 --> 1:28:08.117
I don't like that word.

1:28:08.288 --> 1:28:09.578
Which? Mainframe?

1:28:09.748 --> 1:28:11.828
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.040
No, the "S" word.

1:28:14.211 --> 1:28:16.961
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1:28:18.382 --> 1:28:19.722
Okay, that's better.

1:28:25.722 --> 1:28:27.682
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.

1:28:29.142 --> 1:28:30.192
I disagree.

1:28:30.561 --> 1:28:33.481
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1:28:33.647 --> 1:28:34.767
You have no idea.

1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:37.610
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1:28:37.776 --> 1:28:38.776
Hello.

1:28:39.611 --> 1:28:40.611
Hi.

1:28:47.911 --> 1:28:49.541
Odin brought us together.

1:28:50.330 --> 1:28:53.170
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.

1:28:59.214 --> 1:29:01.344
We might as well be strangers now.

1:29:01.508 --> 1:29:04.678
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1:29:07.681 --> 1:29:09.221
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1:29:10.809 --> 1:29:11.809
Here's the thing.

1:29:11.977 --> 1:29:13.767
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.

1:29:13.937 --> 1:29:15.647
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1:29:17.524 --> 1:29:18.944
Did you just agree with me?

1:29:19.109 --> 1:29:20.689
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1:29:20.861 --> 1:29:22.531
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1:29:22.696 --> 1:29:24.356
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1:29:24.531 --> 1:29:26.241
Do you truly think so little of me?

1:29:28.327 --> 1:29:30.077
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1:29:31.163 --> 1:29:33.753
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

1:29:33.916 --> 1:29:36.746
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1:29:37.461 --> 1:29:39.921
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.

1:29:40.088 --> 1:29:43.588
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.

1:29:48.263 --> 1:29:49.313
Yeah.

1:29:50.474 --> 1:29:52.854
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.

1:29:53.018 --> 1:29:54.308
It's what you always wanted.

1:29:58.524 --> 1:30:00.234
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:01.650
-What?
-"Get Help."

1:30:01.735 --> 1:30:02.735
No.

1:30:02.819 --> 1:30:03.859
-Come on, you love it.
-I hate it.

1:30:03.946 --> 1:30:05.526
-It's great. It works every time.
-It's humiliating.

1:30:05.614 --> 1:30:06.784
-Do you have a better plan?
-No.

1:30:06.949 --> 1:30:07.949
We're doing it.

1:30:08.116 --> 1:30:09.906
We are not doing "Get Help."

1:30:10.953 --> 1:30:12.203
Get help! Please!

1:30:12.371 --> 1:30:13.411
My brother, he's dying.

1:30:13.580 --> 1:30:15.580
Get help! Help him!

1:30:17.626 --> 1:30:18.876
Classic.

1:30:19.253 --> 1:30:20.343
Still hate it.

1:30:20.504 --> 1:30:22.844
-It's humiliating.
-Not for me, it's not.

1:30:23.006 --> 1:30:25.126
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1:30:25.300 --> 1:30:26.300
The Commodore.

1:30:26.969 --> 1:30:27.969
Right.

1:30:30.806 --> 1:30:33.386
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1:30:35.519 --> 1:30:37.309
Loki.

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:39.810
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,

1:30:39.982 --> 1:30:41.652
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

1:30:41.817 --> 1:30:44.897
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.

1:30:45.070 --> 1:30:46.700
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1:30:46.864 --> 1:30:48.324
Easier to let it burn.

1:30:48.657 --> 1:30:49.657
I agree.

1:30:58.125 --> 1:30:59.755
That looks painful.

1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.300
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1:31:03.463 --> 1:31:05.473
I trust you, you betray me.

1:31:05.632 --> 1:31:07.682
Round and round in circles we go.

1:31:07.843 --> 1:31:09.843
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.

1:31:10.012 --> 1:31:11.222
It's about change.

1:31:11.388 --> 1:31:14.598
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

1:31:15.142 --> 1:31:16.772
I guess what I'm trying to say

1:31:16.935 --> 1:31:19.895
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,

1:31:20.063 --> 1:31:21.563
but you could be more.

1:31:24.026 --> 1:31:26.026
I'll just put this over here for you.

1:31:26.195 --> 1:31:29.705
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1:31:35.537 --> 1:31:36.907
All right, I can figure this out.

1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:39.040
It's just another spaceship.

1:31:52.262 --> 1:31:53.642
Loyal Sakaarians,

1:31:53.805 --> 1:31:57.345
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.

1:31:58.769 --> 1:32:01.939
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.

1:32:02.105 --> 1:32:03.895
Do not let him leave this planet.

1:32:16.870 --> 1:32:18.330
-Good shot!
-Thanks.

1:32:21.041 --> 1:32:22.251
Open the doors.

1:32:22.417 --> 1:32:23.837
Okay.

1:32:28.966 --> 1:32:30.836
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1:32:31.009 --> 1:32:32.049
Why?

1:32:44.523 --> 1:32:46.363
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?

1:32:46.525 --> 1:32:47.575
Yes, we should.

1:32:47.651 --> 1:32:49.531
Where are the guns on this ship?

1:32:49.695 --> 1:32:51.075
There aren't any.

1:32:51.238 --> 1:32:52.818
-It's a leisure vessel.
-What?

1:32:52.990 --> 1:32:55.830
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.

1:32:55.993 --> 1:32:58.583
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?

1:32:58.745 --> 1:32:59.945
Yeah.

1:33:00.122 --> 1:33:01.542
Don't touch anything.

1:33:21.852 --> 1:33:22.852
No!

1:33:26.148 --> 1:33:27.188
-No!
-No!

1:33:34.156 --> 1:33:35.236
Get inside!

1:33:35.407 --> 1:33:37.077
In a minute.

1:33:48.420 --> 1:33:50.300
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1:33:50.464 --> 1:33:51.974
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1:33:52.132 --> 1:33:53.842
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1:33:54.009 --> 1:33:57.299
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1:34:31.713 --> 1:34:32.763
Okay, come on.

1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:34.970
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1:34:35.133 --> 1:34:36.183
That looks like a gun.

1:34:37.302 --> 1:34:39.932
It's my birthday
It's my birthday

1:34:40.681 --> 1:34:43.101
It's my birthday

1:34:49.773 --> 1:34:51.073
Yeah!

1:35:08.375 --> 1:35:10.625
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1:35:17.384 --> 1:35:18.394
There she is.

1:35:18.552 --> 1:35:20.602
Our ticket out of here.

1:35:21.054 --> 1:35:22.354
Hey, what's this?

1:35:27.394 --> 1:35:28.404
Thank you.

1:35:28.478 --> 1:35:30.978
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1:35:31.064 --> 1:35:32.074
You wanna come?

1:35:32.566 --> 1:35:36.896
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.

1:35:37.070 --> 1:35:38.610
Why, thank you.

1:35:42.367 --> 1:35:43.447
Here we go.

1:35:50.042 --> 1:35:51.042
Shit.

1:36:08.477 --> 1:36:10.267
Asgardians...

1:36:10.437 --> 1:36:13.017
Some misguided soul

1:36:13.815 --> 1:36:15.775
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1:36:15.943 --> 1:36:18.323
Tell us where it is

1:36:18.487 --> 1:36:21.107
or there will be consequences.

1:36:25.035 --> 1:36:26.155
Bad ones.

1:36:29.331 --> 1:36:30.331
Well?

1:36:37.422 --> 1:36:38.592
You.

1:37:14.668 --> 1:37:18.878
Well? Executioner?

1:37:23.844 --> 1:37:25.054
Wait!

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:26.220
Wait!

1:37:28.724 --> 1:37:29.854
I know where the sword is.

1:38:12.768 --> 1:38:15.018
I never thought I'd be back here.

1:38:18.607 --> 1:38:20.187
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1:38:20.651 --> 1:38:23.651
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.

1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:24.990
Here, up here in the mountains.

1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:27.450
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1:38:27.658 --> 1:38:28.658
She's coming for them.

1:38:28.825 --> 1:38:30.655
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.

1:38:30.827 --> 1:38:32.077
And get yourself killed?

1:38:32.246 --> 1:38:33.996
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1:38:34.164 --> 1:38:36.794
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.

1:38:36.959 --> 1:38:38.749
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1:38:39.253 --> 1:38:40.883
I have a man on the ground.

1:38:46.844 --> 1:38:47.844
Asgard.

1:38:51.265 --> 1:38:52.605
She's here.

1:39:04.152 --> 1:39:05.862
Now the ship has a gun.

1:39:06.029 --> 1:39:07.199
I'll take it from here.

1:39:08.031 --> 1:39:11.161
I found this in the armory.

1:39:14.329 --> 1:39:15.539
Good luck.

1:39:16.999 --> 1:39:18.419
Your Majesty...

1:39:20.377 --> 1:39:21.497
Don't die.

1:39:24.298 --> 1:39:26.088
You know what I mean.

1:40:24.983 --> 1:40:26.903
We must keep moving!

1:40:27.528 --> 1:40:29.318
Go to the Bifrost!

1:41:11.905 --> 1:41:13.275
Sister.

1:41:15.284 --> 1:41:17.084
You're still alive.

1:41:17.244 --> 1:41:20.714
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.

1:41:20.873 --> 1:41:25.423
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.

1:41:27.087 --> 1:41:28.707
Or to cast it out.

1:41:30.966 --> 1:41:34.466
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1:41:35.053 --> 1:41:36.433
You see?

1:41:37.097 --> 1:41:39.217
You never knew him.

1:41:39.516 --> 1:41:41.426
Not at his best.

1:41:41.602 --> 1:41:46.152
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.

1:41:46.315 --> 1:41:49.235
Where do you think all this gold
came from?

1:41:49.401 --> 1:41:51.151
And then, one day,

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:54.320
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1:41:54.489 --> 1:41:57.119
To foster peace, to protect life.

1:41:58.243 --> 1:41:59.833
To have you.

1:42:00.287 --> 1:42:02.657
I understand why you're angry.

1:42:02.831 --> 1:42:06.751
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.

1:42:06.919 --> 1:42:08.749
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1:42:08.921 --> 1:42:10.131
But it can't be you.

1:42:10.297 --> 1:42:13.967
You're just the worst.

1:42:15.427 --> 1:42:17.217
Okay, get up.

1:42:17.387 --> 1:42:19.427
You're in my seat.

1:42:20.390 --> 1:42:22.390
You know, Father once told me

1:42:22.559 --> 1:42:25.099
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1:42:25.270 --> 1:42:27.810
But must always be ready for it.

1:42:59.930 --> 1:43:01.390
Go back!

1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:07.850
Go!

1:43:42.764 --> 1:43:45.354
To be honest, I expected more.

1:43:48.353 --> 1:43:49.653
Heimdall!

1:43:51.857 --> 1:43:53.607
The sword!

1:43:58.113 --> 1:43:59.663
Here's the difference between us.

1:43:59.823 --> 1:44:01.413
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1:44:01.575 --> 1:44:03.995
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1:44:04.161 --> 1:44:05.911
And you're nothing.

1:44:16.173 --> 1:44:19.053
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

1:44:22.763 --> 1:44:25.023
Now you remind me of Dad.

1:44:35.317 --> 1:44:37.067
The stupid dog won't die!

1:44:58.882 --> 1:45:01.892
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.

1:45:02.094 --> 1:45:04.184
You wanted to know who I am?

1:45:05.138 --> 1:45:06.768
What the hell are you talking about?

1:45:06.932 --> 1:45:08.352
You'll see!

1:45:57.024 --> 1:45:59.234
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1:45:59.401 --> 1:46:00.781
I'll get that sword,

1:46:00.944 --> 1:46:03.664
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1:46:30.307 --> 1:46:31.307
Hey, man.

1:46:32.851 --> 1:46:34.271
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1:46:34.436 --> 1:46:36.896
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?

1:46:46.615 --> 1:46:50.455
Your savior is here.

1:46:57.668 --> 1:46:59.538
Did you miss me?

1:46:59.711 --> 1:47:01.171
Everyone, on that ship now.

1:47:05.551 --> 1:47:07.721
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1:47:07.886 --> 1:47:08.966
Of course you did.

1:47:25.654 --> 1:47:27.954
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1:47:28.991 --> 1:47:30.031
You see...

1:47:30.826 --> 1:47:33.746
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1:47:35.622 --> 1:47:37.292
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1:47:38.417 --> 1:47:40.787
What were you the god of, again?

1:47:52.139 --> 1:47:54.019
Even when you had two eyes,

1:47:54.725 --> 1:47:56.605
you'd see only half the picture.

1:47:58.187 --> 1:48:01.187
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1:48:02.274 --> 1:48:05.824
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1:48:08.864 --> 1:48:12.584
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.

1:48:13.368 --> 1:48:15.158
It was never your source of strength.

1:48:15.871 --> 1:48:18.211
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1:48:19.249 --> 1:48:21.919
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1:48:23.170 --> 1:48:24.460
This could be Asgard.

1:48:25.631 --> 1:48:27.721
Asgard is where our people stand.

1:48:28.717 --> 1:48:33.507
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1:48:41.230 --> 1:48:43.360
I'm not as strong as you.

1:48:46.026 --> 1:48:47.066
No...

1:48:48.487 --> 1:48:49.777
You're stronger.

1:48:58.789 --> 1:49:00.169
Tell me, brother.

1:49:00.332 --> 1:49:02.792
What were you the god of, again?

1:51:18.136 --> 1:51:20.346
-You're late.
-You're missing an eye.

1:51:20.514 --> 1:51:22.024
This isn't over.

1:51:29.147 --> 1:51:30.857
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1:51:32.442 --> 1:51:33.572
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1:51:33.735 --> 1:51:36.025
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.

1:51:36.196 --> 1:51:37.196
It did nothing.

1:51:41.201 --> 1:51:43.831
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1:51:44.454 --> 1:51:45.914
It won't end there.

1:51:46.081 --> 1:51:49.501
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1:51:49.668 --> 1:51:51.378
She'll hunt us down.

1:51:51.545 --> 1:51:53.095
We need to stop her here and now.

1:51:53.255 --> 1:51:54.465
So what do we do?

1:51:55.215 --> 1:51:56.795
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1:52:08.937 --> 1:52:12.227
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1:52:14.359 --> 1:52:15.399
Loki,

1:52:15.485 --> 1:52:17.445
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1:52:17.613 --> 1:52:19.663
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1:52:19.823 --> 1:52:21.453
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1:52:23.035 --> 1:52:24.495
It's the only way.

1:52:24.995 --> 1:52:26.455
Bold move, brother.

1:52:27.748 --> 1:52:29.328
Even for me.

1:52:32.544 --> 1:52:33.594
Shall we?

1:52:34.713 --> 1:52:35.713
After you.

1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:02.740
This is madness.

1:53:16.338 --> 1:53:17.918
Go! Go, now!

1:54:18.942 --> 1:54:20.402
For Asgard.

1:54:34.666 --> 1:54:35.996
Hela!

1:55:00.567 --> 1:55:04.697
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1:55:16.250 --> 1:55:17.500
Hela, enough!

1:55:21.171 --> 1:55:24.051
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1:55:24.216 --> 1:55:27.636
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

1:55:27.803 --> 1:55:29.473
You can't defeat me.

1:55:30.097 --> 1:55:31.427
No, I know.

1:55:33.141 --> 1:55:34.181
But he can.

1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:39.860
No.

1:55:48.448 --> 1:55:51.868
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1:55:52.035 --> 1:55:54.155
I am your reckoning!

1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:04.420
The people are safe.

1:56:05.048 --> 1:56:06.928
That's all that matters.

1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:10.100
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1:56:10.596 --> 1:56:11.966
I hate this prophecy.

1:56:12.139 --> 1:56:13.929
So do I, but we have no choice.

1:56:14.099 --> 1:56:15.889
Surtur destroys Asgard,

1:56:16.059 --> 1:56:18.399
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1:56:18.562 --> 1:56:21.312
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...

1:56:23.150 --> 1:56:24.150
No!

1:56:26.403 --> 1:56:28.453
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1:56:37.539 --> 1:56:38.579
Hulk, stop.

1:56:38.749 --> 1:56:41.789
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1:56:42.961 --> 1:56:44.671
Big monster!

1:56:45.005 --> 1:56:46.295
Let's go!

1:56:48.091 --> 1:56:49.091
Fine.

1:57:13.158 --> 1:57:16.038
I am Asgard's doom!

1:57:39.017 --> 1:57:41.097
The damage is not too bad.

1:57:41.270 --> 1:57:43.270
As long as the foundations
are still strong,

1:57:43.438 --> 1:57:45.068
we can rebuild this place.

1:57:45.232 --> 1:57:47.442
It will become a haven

1:57:47.609 --> 1:57:50.569
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

1:57:57.619 --> 1:58:00.039
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1:58:14.928 --> 1:58:16.848
What have I done?

1:58:18.015 --> 1:58:20.435
You saved us from extinction.

1:58:20.601 --> 1:58:22.441
Asgard is not a place...

1:58:23.937 --> 1:58:25.807
It's a people.

1:58:54.885 --> 1:58:56.395
It suits you.

1:58:59.139 --> 1:59:01.599
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.

1:59:02.351 --> 1:59:03.391
Maybe not.

1:59:04.603 --> 1:59:05.773
Thank you.

1:59:06.522 --> 1:59:09.022
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1:59:13.111 --> 1:59:14.361
I'm here.

1:59:38.637 --> 1:59:39.967
Your throne.

1:59:55.070 --> 1:59:58.410
So, King of Asgard.

2:00:08.917 --> 2:00:10.037
Where to?

2:00:11.170 --> 2:00:12.590
I'm not sure.

2:00:12.963 --> 2:00:14.263
Any suggestions?

2:00:16.884 --> 2:00:18.844
Miek, where are you from?

2:00:19.011 --> 2:00:20.851
Miek's dead.

2:00:21.013 --> 2:00:24.143
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.

2:00:24.308 --> 2:00:26.978
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.

2:00:29.521 --> 2:00:30.981
Miek, you're alive!

2:00:31.148 --> 2:00:33.478
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?

2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:36.490
Earth it is.

2:02:53.373 --> 2:02:56.083
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?

2:02:56.251 --> 2:02:59.551
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.

2:03:00.130 --> 2:03:02.050
Let me rephrase that.

2:03:02.216 --> 2:03:05.426
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?

2:03:05.969 --> 2:03:08.009
Probably not, to be honest.

2:03:08.180 --> 2:03:13.100
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.

2:09:42.032 --> 2:09:43.032
Oh, boy.

2:09:51.458 --> 2:09:55.588
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

2:09:55.754 --> 2:09:59.174
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

2:09:59.341 --> 2:10:01.801
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

2:10:01.969 --> 2:10:04.349
Come on. No?

2:10:04.596 --> 2:10:06.636
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.

2:10:06.807 --> 2:10:09.597
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

2:10:09.768 --> 2:10:11.808
So, you're welcome.

2:10:11.979 --> 2:10:14.309
And it's a tie.
