WEBVTT

00:57.480 --> 00:59.596
Lobbying is about foresight.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.075
About anticipating
your opponent's moves

01:05.120 --> 01:07.190
and devising countermeasures.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.636
The winner plots one step
ahead of the opposition,

01:15.400 --> 01:16.879
and plays her trump card

01:18.480 --> 01:20.436
just after they play theirs.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.136
You better
not be saying that

01:24.160 --> 01:25.309
when you're in there.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.871
It's about making sure
you surprise them,

01:30.280 --> 01:32.430
and they don't surprise you.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.874
I'm gonna ask you again.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.296
Miss Sloane, could you please

01:44.320 --> 01:45.719
describe the nature
of your work?

01:51.720 --> 01:53.096
On the advice of counsel,

01:53.120 --> 01:54.896
I respectfully decline
to answer your question,

01:54.920 --> 01:56.751
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

01:56.840 --> 01:58.160
to the United States
Constitution.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.588
Those words,

02:02.760 --> 02:04.576
when you're not taking the
oath or confirming details,

02:04.600 --> 02:06.680
those words, in that order,
are all you're gonna say.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.995
"On average, would you say
you bribed public officials

02:14.080 --> 02:15.360
"more or less
than once a month?"

02:15.920 --> 02:18.718
Upon the advice of counsel...
Can I deviate slightly?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.400
"On the advice of counsel"?
On the advice

02:20.760 --> 02:21.816
- "of my attorney"?
- You do not...

02:21.840 --> 02:23.910
Okay, okay, I understand
that last one's

02:24.000 --> 02:25.194
too adventurous for you.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.080
This would be
a whole lot easier

02:30.240 --> 02:31.639
if I could just shout "Fifth."

02:32.200 --> 02:33.349
They want you behind bars.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.675
You make one statement,

02:35.800 --> 02:37.313
you correct one
nefarious allegation,

02:37.400 --> 02:38.879
that's it.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.240
You waive your right
to the Fifth

02:40.280 --> 02:41.920
and you're compelled
to answer everything.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.376
They're taking you
to the woodshed

02:44.400 --> 02:45.600
in front of
the national press.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.838
They're gonna rile you so bad

02:48.080 --> 02:50.116
they'd make Gandhi wanna
cut their tongues out.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.656
" Did you arrange for
benefits such as travel,

02:54.680 --> 02:55.749
"luxury accommodations,

02:55.840 --> 02:57.176
"and sports tickets
to be furnished

02:57.200 --> 02:58.315
"to members of Congress

02:58.400 --> 02:59.753
"at the behest
of your clients?"

03:03.280 --> 03:04.976
" Did you arrange for benefits
such as travel,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.275
"luxury accommodations,
and sports tickets to..."

03:07.360 --> 03:08.560
Daniel. When I take the stand,

03:08.640 --> 03:10.153
you'll see nothing
but a granite wall.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.389
Good.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.674
Miss Sloane!

03:38.840 --> 03:40.910
Nothing to say, guys,
thank you.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.758
Miss Sloane, Miss Sloane!

04:00.840 --> 04:02.193
This is tight.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.200
You'd think they would choose
a more appropriate venue.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.916
Well, turns out the Nationals
had a home game.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.955
Good morning.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.235
I am Senator Ronald Sperling,

04:19.360 --> 04:21.635
Chair of this Hearing.
Miss Sloane...

04:28.200 --> 04:29.633
Please raise your right hand.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.476
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

04:33.560 --> 04:35.176
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.475
under pains and penalties
of perjury?

04:37.560 --> 04:39.118
- I do.
- Please, sit.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.990
Will the witness please
state her full name

04:43.080 --> 04:44.308
for the record?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.799
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.029
Louder, please.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.677
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.496
And could
the witness please confirm

04:52.520 --> 04:54.954
that these details
are accurate...

04:55.280 --> 04:56.474
Uh...

04:56.560 --> 05:00.348
Date of birth, July 26, 1976,
address...

05:00.920 --> 05:02.069
Suite 504, Watergate South,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.390
700 New Hampshire Avenue
North West, Washington D.C.?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.075
Correct.

05:06.200 --> 05:11.069
You were employed by Cole,
Kravitz and Waterman LLP

05:11.320 --> 05:13.629
for a 10-year period
between 2006 and 2016,

05:13.720 --> 05:14.776
before moving on earlier...

05:14.800 --> 05:15.800
Eleven year period.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.435
Excuse me?

05:18.520 --> 05:21.512
There are 11 years
between 2006 and 2016.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.720
What was the nature
of your work

05:27.760 --> 05:29.990
with Cole, Kravitz
and Waterman LLP?

05:34.560 --> 05:35.675
Upon the advice of counsel,

05:35.760 --> 05:37.830
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

05:38.640 --> 05:40.360
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

05:40.400 --> 05:42.072
to the United States
Constitution.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.558
Did you,
October 12th of last year,

05:45.640 --> 05:47.631
accept as a client
the government

05:47.720 --> 05:49.950
of the Asian Republic
of Indonesia,

05:50.040 --> 05:51.758
for the purpose of
campaigning against

05:51.840 --> 05:54.229
the levy of additional
Federal duties

05:54.320 --> 05:57.596
on the importation of palm oil
into the United States?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.748
Upon the advice of counsel,

06:00.880 --> 06:03.235
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

06:03.320 --> 06:05.231
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

06:05.480 --> 06:07.516
to the United States
Constitution.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.877
Today is a landmark day,
you know why?

06:13.960 --> 06:15.029
Because I'm free.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.348
Name one thing
you can do today

06:16.480 --> 06:17.696
that you couldn't have
done yesterday.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.720
Quit my job.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.896
You could've
done that yesterday,

06:19.920 --> 06:20.976
but it would've been stupid.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.896
- I can quit today and...
- It'd still be stupid.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.069
You clear your college debt

06:24.160 --> 06:25.878
and celebrate by
enrolling in post-grad?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.792
Academia's more my scene.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.256
You didn't follow me
into the crapper

06:30.280 --> 06:32.271
to gloat about freedom, Jane.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.749
Talk to me about
the Nutella Tax.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.751
Uh, we're really calling it
the "Nutella Tax"?

06:36.840 --> 06:38.592
Palm oil is a key ingredient
in Nutella.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.832
If the Federal Government
taxes it at 300%,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.476
it'll cost more for us
to gorge ourselves on it.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.031
Isn't palm oil in
pretty much everything?

06:46.680 --> 06:48.120
We could have called it
the Soap Tax,

06:48.160 --> 06:49.376
but the public cares
more about Nutella

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
than they do soap.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.400
Anyway, we get
four more senators

06:52.440 --> 06:53.600
to come out against the bill,

06:53.640 --> 06:55.080
we can lean on Jacobs
to withdraw it.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.349
What are you gonna do?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.360
Tell the Indonesians they're
going to host Senator Jacobs

07:00.440 --> 07:02.396
on a field trip to
one of their plantations.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.277
You never washed your hands.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.436
He'll take the wife and kids
on a tropical vacation.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.034
Come back hailing
their conservation efforts.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.551
His bill dies a quiet death.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.296
If the Indonesian
government pays for it,

07:16.320 --> 07:17.389
it's illegal.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.755
If they use a non-profit c3
to sponsor the travel,

07:19.840 --> 07:21.239
it's perfectly legal.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.200
As long as the trip
is for educational purposes.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.675
But, the Indonesian government
is still paying for it.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.149
See, this is why I'm thinking
about post-grad.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.800
Jane, we go to school to
prepare us for the real world.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.359
I'm not sure
I like the real world.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.016
So you want to bury
your head in Socrates?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.873
You know that Socrates
never actually wrote anything.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.915
That's beside the point.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.513
If you don't like it,
you change it.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.636
- That's why you're here.
- Miss Sloane!

07:42.720 --> 07:44.456
They're ready for you
in the conference room.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.456
Hey, Spencer, did you know
that Americans care more

07:46.480 --> 07:48.596
about Nutella than
they do about soap?

07:50.160 --> 07:51.388
Uh, okay.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.035
See that?

07:53.480 --> 07:54.754
No reaction.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.776
Okay, guys, we
gotta be quick this morning,

07:56.800 --> 07:58.153
I've got a meeting to get to.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.151
How many are they
expecting at the IMF rally?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.434
Between 500 and 1,000.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.351
There's a margin of 100%?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.416
Does that technically mean
that nobody might show up?

08:05.440 --> 08:07.874
Five hundred's the minimum,
the rest depends on weather.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.871
Seems more people hate
banks when the sun's out.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.576
- What's the weather forecast?
- Liz?

08:11.600 --> 08:12.736
Time we sold Jacobs
on Indonesia.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.829
I know.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.434
- When Henry falls we've got...
- Critical mass, I'm aware.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.795
Get a non-profit
to sponsor a vacation.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.871
They give him face
and he'll pull it.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.030
Did you just come from
the ladies' room?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.016
Uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.976
We're talking about
numbers at the IMF rally.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.036
All right, Alex,
put Metro Talent on notice,

08:29.120 --> 08:31.076
- we may need reinforcements.
- I'm on it.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.336
We're really gonna
use movie extras?

08:32.360 --> 08:33.776
The guy shouting about
corporate greed

08:33.800 --> 08:35.438
becomes a lot less
credible standing next

08:35.520 --> 08:37.033
to a hobo from central casting,

08:37.160 --> 08:39.515
with a banner that reads,
"Abolish money."

08:39.600 --> 08:40.749
"Shit is fucked up

08:40.840 --> 08:42.193
"and bullshit."

08:42.560 --> 08:44.994
Best banner at Occupy.
Tell me that was one of ours.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.719
Oh, no, that was creative
way beyond my capabilities.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.792
- Franklin! Shmallow Cakes?
- Uh, yeah!

08:50.880 --> 08:52.416
Does sales tax apply
to cakes and cookies,

08:52.440 --> 08:53.440
or only to one of those?

08:54.640 --> 08:56.471
I don't know.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.955
You don't know?

09:03.520 --> 09:04.576
All right, everybody, listen up!

09:04.600 --> 09:05.776
I'm going to tell you a story.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.835
Please, no.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.216
A priest is
giving a young nun

09:08.240 --> 09:09.639
a lift home from
church one day,

09:09.720 --> 09:11.312
and as he's shifting gears,

09:11.400 --> 09:13.960
he rests his hand
on the nun's knee.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.736
This is offensive
and inappropriate.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.296
The young nun looks up
at the priest and says,

09:17.320 --> 09:20.118
"Father, remember Luke 14:10."

09:20.960 --> 09:22.837
The priest withdraws his hand,
embarrassed.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.792
Next time
they stop at a light,

09:25.040 --> 09:27.554
he places his hand a little
higher up on her thigh,

09:27.640 --> 09:31.110
again the nun says,
"Remember Luke 14:10, Father."

09:31.680 --> 09:33.079
The priest apologizes.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.435
"The flesh is weak," he says.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.256
So he drops her off,
and when he gets home,

09:37.280 --> 09:40.909
he reaches for his bible
and he flips to Luke 14:10.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.558
Anyone know what it says? Hmm?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.553
What does it say, Pat?

09:45.920 --> 09:49.276
"Friend, come up higher,
then shalt thou have glory!"

09:49.400 --> 09:51.436
Know your subject, people!

09:52.400 --> 09:53.833
Failure to do so may result

09:53.920 --> 09:55.478
in the loss of
a golden opportunity.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.278
When I see you this afternoon,

09:57.360 --> 09:58.416
you'd better be
ready to recite

09:58.440 --> 10:00.590
that tax code in Esperanto.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.669
I'm... I'm told I should
offer her my hand, huh?

10:08.720 --> 10:10.278
How do you mean?

10:10.960 --> 10:13.997
Well, when we meet,
I'm told that

10:14.080 --> 10:17.072
she doesn't care for
all that kissy-kissy stuff

10:17.160 --> 10:19.469
that most women do these days.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.915
You two
have never met?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.434
Well, we've been to several
of the same functions, yeah,

10:24.560 --> 10:26.039
but we've never
been introduced.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.634
In a town this small,
how does that happen?

10:30.440 --> 10:32.715
So, should I
offer my hand?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.120
I wouldn't
worry about it.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.796
- Liz?
- Good morning!

10:37.960 --> 10:39.234
Bill Sandford.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.753
I'm amazed
it's taken this long.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.110
Well, you know, I wanted
to introduce myself

10:43.200 --> 10:44.400
at the Free Enterprise Dinner,

10:44.520 --> 10:47.114
but you were the first one
out the door.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.997
Minor crisis on the Hill.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.749
Well, a lesser commander

10:50.840 --> 10:52.353
would've left that
to a soldier,

10:52.440 --> 10:54.192
which is the reason I'm here.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.236
Why exactly are you here?

10:56.320 --> 10:58.151
Killing bills
like Heaton-Harris,

10:58.240 --> 10:59.798
that's food and drink
to you guys.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.110
- So you've read it?
- No, but I know what it is.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.758
It's a bipartisan gun bill

11:03.840 --> 11:05.353
requiring universal
background checks.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.792
On all sales of firearms.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.199
Now, come on.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.511
A father and his son,
lifelong friends.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.319
It just means longer delays.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.311
It's some kind of
Big Brother type criminal

11:18.400 --> 11:20.231
and mental health database.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.039
An unconstitutional fetter
on the Second Amendment

11:23.160 --> 11:24.991
which, as you said,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.753
we will eat for breakfast.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.355
Mr. Sandford, I deal
primarily in taxation

11:32.680 --> 11:33.976
and Federal Government
interference

11:34.000 --> 11:35.080
in free enterprise. This...

11:35.120 --> 11:36.678
I'm aware, I am aware.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
But I'll tell you,

11:38.440 --> 11:40.431
the reputation you have
garnered for yourself,

11:40.520 --> 11:42.909
we were just looking for
an excuse to engage you.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.313
Okay. Let's have it.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.554
Women.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.033
Our polling data is telling us

11:55.120 --> 11:57.156
that we're not connecting
with the female voter.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.269
So, we want to change
the narrative.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.511
From mothers losing
their kids to guns,

12:04.600 --> 12:07.239
to mothers protecting
their kids with guns.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.794
From a battered wife
threatened by a bullet,

12:10.880 --> 12:14.475
to fending off her
violent husband with a.38.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.634
Guns as tools
of female empowerment.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.637
What's the saying?
God created humans...

12:20.760 --> 12:23.513
Samuel Colt made them equal.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.909
Now, Liz, imagine
a new organization,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.468
pitched at women
who are deterred

12:34.480 --> 12:37.233
by the strong rhetoric of the
Second Amendment groups,

12:37.360 --> 12:40.193
and by our association
with the political right.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.757
But no links to us,
no baggage.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.836
No overt position on guns.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.508
And you

12:51.320 --> 12:54.517
will build it up,
you will drive its agenda,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.398
and slowly but surely,

12:58.240 --> 13:00.151
you will turn those members

13:00.480 --> 13:03.916
into paid-up guardians
of the Second Amendment.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.958
So, what? Um...

13:25.040 --> 13:27.508
Mothers For A Safer America...

13:27.600 --> 13:30.592
Achieved by making sure

13:30.680 --> 13:32.910
every last citizen is
armed to the teeth?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.200
Liz?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.311
Jesus, is this the reputation
I've garnered?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.311
Gold medalist
in ethical limbo?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.834
I see no ethical problem
with reframing an issue.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.753
Trying to win the female vote
by taking the gun lobby

13:44.840 --> 13:46.956
and dressing it up
in a frilly pink frock,

13:47.040 --> 13:48.075
it is so crude,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.360
it could only have originated
in a room full of old men.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
Well, it didn't!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.479
This is my own idea.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.710
Well, my advice
is to kill it in utero.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.718
You'll need more
than the trite wisdom

14:02.800 --> 14:04.074
that we value security

14:04.160 --> 14:06.594
to get us behind your views
on the Second Amendment.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.879
Well, the fact remains

14:16.000 --> 14:17.520
that when it comes
to the female voter,

14:18.000 --> 14:19.638
our numbers need to be better.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.389
I see.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.317
Well, why don't I take
a look at the numbers

14:29.400 --> 14:30.992
and then we'll proceed
from there?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.176
Who the hell
does she think she is?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.315
It can be spun.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.680
For the purpose of
gaining trust,

14:36.720 --> 14:38.136
it may've been
the right tactical move.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.549
And do you believe,
for one nanosecond,

14:40.640 --> 14:42.596
that was at the forefront
of her mind

14:42.680 --> 14:44.160
when she told him
to take his business

14:44.480 --> 14:45.993
and shove it up
his gun barrel?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.080
Candice!

14:47.280 --> 14:48.918
I want Sloane
in my office now!

14:50.800 --> 14:51.994
She's good, isn't she?

14:52.240 --> 14:53.559
You'll look at the numbers?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.509
I'm sure the president

14:55.600 --> 14:58.478
of one of the most powerful
groups on the Hill

14:58.560 --> 15:00.232
will be honored
that Her Majesty

15:00.320 --> 15:02.754
has agreed to look
at the fucking numbers!

15:04.600 --> 15:05.953
What's going on with you?

15:06.040 --> 15:07.837
The current system
is so porous, it floats.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.751
I don't remember
you caring, ever,

15:09.840 --> 15:11.671
one way or another about guns!

15:11.760 --> 15:13.398
My position solidified
somewhere

15:13.480 --> 15:15.311
between Columbine
and Charleston.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.397
Come on, George,
any head-case,

15:17.520 --> 15:19.875
felon or terrorist can
buy an assault rifle

15:19.960 --> 15:21.359
from a gun show, the Internet,

15:21.480 --> 15:23.914
or his buddy
at the Bowl-O-Rama

15:24.000 --> 15:26.468
without so much as an ID.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.856
Heaton-Harris
puts a stop to that.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.791
Christ, Liz,
this is the gun lobby.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.949
Do you have any idea

15:31.040 --> 15:32.680
how long I've been trying
to reel them in?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.548
No.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.709
Something happened.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.720
Someone you know
was the victim of a gun crime.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.155
Nonsense.
I just formed an opinion.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.670
You're the champion
of the free market.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.077
You abhor frivolous
government intervention...

15:46.160 --> 15:47.309
I would hardly categorize

15:47.400 --> 15:48.776
responsible gun laws
as frivolous...

15:48.800 --> 15:49.915
Indonesians!

15:50.440 --> 15:53.876
For Christ's sake,
you rep Indonesians!

15:54.160 --> 15:55.752
To stop our government
from looting

15:55.840 --> 15:57.239
one of their
few sources of income.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.673
And what is wrong
with Indonesia?

15:58.760 --> 15:59.816
We're about to
secure Al Jacobs

15:59.840 --> 16:01.114
with a field trip there.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.713
Is that a promise or a threat?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.559
I can just picture
the good Senator

16:04.640 --> 16:06.039
being boiled in a cauldron

16:06.120 --> 16:08.395
with all these natives
dancing around him.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.479
Get back to
your Fortune 500 clients.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.915
Your colorful interventions
are the cause of

16:14.000 --> 16:16.753
a lot of industry backchat
this firm could do without.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.717
I work on behalf of
causes I believe in.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.153
That's how I sleep at night.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.918
You don't sleep at night.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.389
You sit and obsess
about winning,

16:25.760 --> 16:27.239
no matter the cause.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.673
Those little pills
in your purse

16:29.800 --> 16:31.472
are not the kind that
lull you to sleep.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.951
The only reason you

16:34.040 --> 16:38.238
and your team of gum-chewing
ragamuffins are here

16:38.680 --> 16:42.036
is that your arrogant pranks
might generate enough buzz

16:42.120 --> 16:44.270
to attract clients
like Bill Sandford.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.793
Meaning, if you don't dedicate
yourself to his cause,

16:49.200 --> 16:51.350
this firm won't have
any use for you.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.511
Now go away,
look into those numbers,

16:59.520 --> 17:01.272
and start getting
women into guns.

17:06.280 --> 17:09.272
- Any dizziness? Nausea?
- No.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.999
That's what you always say.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.513
Doctor, I'm fine.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.096
If my insurance company
weren't such sticklers,

17:15.120 --> 17:16.880
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.280
What time are you
getting to sleep?

17:18.560 --> 17:19.629
I sleep a lot, it varies.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.797
What time did you get to
sleep last night?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.268
Did you get any sleep at all?

17:24.360 --> 17:25.509
These are busy times.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.875
You don't need
a doctor to tell you

17:27.960 --> 17:29.880
that you're working yourself
into an early grave.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.554
The long hours...

17:31.640 --> 17:32.816
Okay, when you
called me just now,

17:32.840 --> 17:34.068
what number did you dial?

17:34.160 --> 17:35.229
Your home number.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.856
Cell is off,
cocoa is on the stove,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.074
book is at my bedside.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.679
I'll be asleep
in under two hours.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.479
Thanks for calling, Doctor.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.816
In the Republican party,

17:42.840 --> 17:44.240
he can help you out
in California...

17:44.680 --> 17:45.874
Okay!

17:46.000 --> 17:47.319
Good, welcome.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.072
Yes! Yeah.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.992
I want you to meet
Senator Davidson.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.992
Yes. I appreciate you coming
to every fundraiser.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.873
Yeah, I'll be right back.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.318
Hello! I expect to
see you next time.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.753
Yes. That would be great.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.353
Yes, nice to see you.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.874
Early night?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.389
If you're looking for a quote,
you're wasting your time.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.496
I've just watched you
extricate yourself

18:50.520 --> 18:51.669
from three conversations

18:51.760 --> 18:53.760
to use the ladies' room
in the space of 30 minutes.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.553
You busted me.
I'm incontinent. Write it up.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.035
I hope I'm wrong,

18:59.120 --> 19:00.696
but one might think
you're sick of this town.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.029
You from the Post?
How did you get in?

19:03.160 --> 19:04.720
I'd just like five minutes
of your time.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.760
Fine.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.115
Walk to my car is three,
get to the point.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.616
The word on the Hill
is that the gun lobby

19:10.640 --> 19:11.993
approached you
over Heaton-Harris

19:12.080 --> 19:13.229
and you refused.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.951
I don't comment on
"word on the Hill."

19:16.040 --> 19:17.519
I know the only way
you'd do that

19:17.600 --> 19:19.318
is if you support the bill.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.719
That's quite a story.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.678
Turning down
a prized client because

19:22.760 --> 19:24.352
you can't accept
what they stand for.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.315
Elizabeth Sloane, the
conviction lobbyist. Who knew?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.320
I said, get to the point.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.315
Will you admit
the present system is broken?

19:32.440 --> 19:34.271
I remain committed
to the Second Amendment.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.751
Dildos are illegal in Texas,

19:36.840 --> 19:38.796
but Joe Public can
walk into a sports store

19:38.880 --> 19:40.154
and walk out with a shotgun.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.793
That would explain
the low rate

19:41.880 --> 19:43.438
of dildo-related
murders in Texas.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.872
Okay, it wasn't that funny.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.993
What do you want?

19:49.080 --> 19:50.308
Your quote.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.271
Fine. A conviction lobbyist

19:54.360 --> 19:56.954
need only believe
in their ability to win.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.395
That's a keeper.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.112
One more thing,
off the record.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.496
- Mmm-hmm.
- What do you know about

20:04.520 --> 20:06.256
- the gun lobby's opponents?
- The Brady Campaign?

20:06.280 --> 20:08.256
I know they're going to lose
because their total budget

20:08.280 --> 20:09.536
is less than what
the gun lobby pays

20:09.560 --> 20:10.600
to get their shoes shined.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.958
What about their lobbyists,
Peterson Wyatt?

20:14.120 --> 20:16.475
They're a boutique bipartisan
Government Affairs agency.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.956
"Boutique" is a euphemism
for "little fish."

20:20.040 --> 20:22.315
"Bipartisan" denotes
a bunch of hippies in suits.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.313
Do you know anything
about their CEO?

20:24.440 --> 20:25.555
Guy named Schmidt?

20:25.640 --> 20:26.959
No, never heard of him.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.554
But if the firm is built
in his image,

20:29.640 --> 20:30.840
I'm sure he's a simpering wuss

20:30.920 --> 20:32.478
with a Ph.D in
style-over-substance.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
Got it.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.631
I never introduced myself,
by the way.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.834
My name's Rodolfo Schmidt,

20:39.840 --> 20:40.989
CEO of Peterson Wyatt.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.160
What's the matter?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.440
Am I not simpering
hard enough?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.228
Your firm's 12 years old,

20:48.320 --> 20:49.976
I'd think your name
would be Peterson or...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.399
What...

20:51.840 --> 20:53.273
What is this about?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.433
You're pro-Heaton-Harris.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
It's an open secret

20:56.600 --> 20:57.976
you're at war with
your firm's leadership.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.353
The Brady Campaign wants you

20:59.440 --> 21:00.839
to lead the fight
to pass the bill.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.832
You'd run defense
out of our office.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.279
When it's over,

21:04.360 --> 21:06.191
you can choose from
any of the D.C. behemoths

21:06.440 --> 21:07.668
lining up for your signature.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.229
This is Peterson Wyatt's quote
for your services.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.677
I don't know
if I should be flattered

21:21.800 --> 21:22.869
or insulted, Mr. Schmidt,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.275
but you clearly have
the wrong opinion of me.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.280
I think my opinion
of you is right on.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.960
Don't tell me you don't want
to take a swing at this.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.149
Goodbye, Mr. Schmidt.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.555
Where's your car?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.756
Should be at the valet by now.
I don't drive.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.559
Hi, Jane?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.240
Yeah, I know what time it is.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.034
Listen...

22:16.920 --> 22:18.512
If, uh, Socrates never
wrote anything,

22:19.400 --> 22:21.231
how is it anyone's
ever heard of him?

22:23.760 --> 22:24.954
Look, we need a meeting.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.736
Where are they putting
Senator Jacobs?

22:28.760 --> 22:29.760
The Lombok Lodge?

22:29.840 --> 22:30.909
Yes.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.439
- It's on the beach?
- Yes.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.794
Good.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.736
This goes off to
the Senate Ethics Committee.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.896
Once they authorize
the travel,

22:36.920 --> 22:38.035
Jacobs is on a plane.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.031
- Is that okay?
- It's fine.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.270
- Technically, I mean?
- Don't worry about it.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.277
It's just... As lobbyists,
we can't be involved

22:44.400 --> 22:46.516
in arranging overseas travel
for members of Congress.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.191
I read ethics regs when
I want to look busy.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.096
If you weren't just
pretending to be busy,

22:51.120 --> 22:52.216
you'd know that the workaround

22:52.240 --> 22:53.336
is to get this
to the non-profit,

22:53.360 --> 22:55.555
have them sign and file
with the Ethics Committee.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.358
Do I seem unduly concerned?

22:57.880 --> 22:58.949
Okay.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.554
George told me
what happened with Sandford.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.993
- Mmm.
- Are you retarded?

23:03.440 --> 23:05.400
Why are you eating
a chocolate cake for breakfast?

23:05.640 --> 23:07.198
- Have you no shame?
- It's a muffin.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.552
You never had
a muffin for breakfast?

23:09.640 --> 23:10.868
A muffin, let's see.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.633
Eggs, milk, flour, sugar,
cocoa powder, chocolate.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.676
That sounds exactly like
a cake, but of course,

23:16.080 --> 23:17.718
no civilized person
would ever eat

23:17.800 --> 23:19.313
a chocolate cake
for breakfast.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.909
You've lost your mind.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.558
Franklin,
are you getting this?

23:22.640 --> 23:23.920
'Cause I'm really
talking to you.

23:23.960 --> 23:24.995
Huh?

23:25.120 --> 23:26.456
Shmallow Cakes
aren't really cakes.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.152
They're marshmallow
paste sandwiched

23:28.280 --> 23:29.816
between two cookies
covered in chocolate.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.239
And while our tax code
deems cakes

23:31.680 --> 23:33.830
luxury items
and hits them harder,

23:34.160 --> 23:36.469
cookies are obviously
necessities,

23:36.640 --> 23:37.789
and therefore exempt.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.394
- Are you getting this?
- What?

23:39.520 --> 23:41.511
Have Shmallow Cakes
re-designated as cookies,

23:41.640 --> 23:43.915
argue cake in the name
is merely marketing puff.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.513
You'll need evidence in court,

23:45.640 --> 23:47.080
but get a team
of scientists to opine

23:47.160 --> 23:52.632
that they are in fact 80%
cookie and zero percent cake.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.349
That's how you win.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.136
You knew that
all along?

23:56.160 --> 23:57.832
You would have
got there eventually.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.096
Then why are you
telling me this?

23:59.120 --> 24:00.519
In case you're not
coming with me.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.112
What's going on?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.349
All right, everyone.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.496
I called you here
to announce that,

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
effective immediately,

24:09.640 --> 24:11.710
I am leaving Cole Kravitz

24:11.840 --> 24:13.353
and starting work
as lead consultant

24:13.480 --> 24:15.550
for the Brady Campaign
at Peterson Wyatt.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.394
I've secured positions
for everyone in this room

24:18.720 --> 24:20.551
without change to
your current compensation.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.114
So, who's with me on this?

24:23.200 --> 24:26.875
I just spent the last hour
wiping your shit

24:27.200 --> 24:28.428
off Bill Sandford's shoes,

24:29.560 --> 24:31.232
assuring him that
you're the right lady

24:31.320 --> 24:32.719
to broaden his membership!

24:33.520 --> 24:35.556
We're inches from
a green fucking light!

24:35.800 --> 24:37.800
So, you're saying I should
put you down as a maybe?

24:40.240 --> 24:42.470
You can't possibly win this!

24:43.360 --> 24:44.793
Who's with me?

24:52.080 --> 24:53.115
I'm with you.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.835
Whoa, whoa, Ross,
hey, come on, I need you.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.069
She needs me more.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.594
Alex?

24:59.600 --> 25:00.669
Lauren?

25:03.360 --> 25:05.555
The fuck is this?
Jerry Maguire?

25:05.920 --> 25:07.035
You've seen Jerry Maguire?

25:08.560 --> 25:09.754
Guns frighten me.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.273
So, Sloane and Co.
versus Connors and who else?

25:18.360 --> 25:21.670
Mmm. O'Hara, Wickman,
Moore, the God Squad.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.155
Ramirez,

25:25.280 --> 25:26.952
how many Tec-9s
do you own again?

25:27.040 --> 25:28.200
Enough to defend my property.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.433
Plus two more
to piss off the lefties.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
All right, Jane,

25:32.920 --> 25:34.416
contact Rodolfo Schmidt
at Peterson Wyatt,

25:34.440 --> 25:36.320
and tell him there's
a total of six coming over.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.834
I count five.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.279
Mathematician
you are not.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.189
Who said I was coming?

25:44.280 --> 25:45.474
I did. Call Rodolfo.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.269
What if I'm staying?

25:47.960 --> 25:49.712
Jesus, now is not
the time to develop

25:50.120 --> 25:51.519
a sense of humor, Jane.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.591
That's good, 'cause I'm not.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.038
Seriously, kid, go.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.709
I could care less.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.594
You were right before.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.558
About post-grad.
Maybe it is a cop-out.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.437
I'm at one of the best firms
in the city.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.676
Your reputation
might survive a move

26:11.840 --> 26:15.628
to some third-tier outfit
to fight a losing battle.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.153
Mine won't.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.275
No shit.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.319
I take it back.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.992
I've learned a lot from you
these last couple years, Liz.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.159
I'll miss you.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.832
The 3:00 a.m. wake-up calls?

26:31.240 --> 26:32.673
Not so much.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.151
You've obviously learned
more than you let on.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.676
You've shown more ambition
in the last 60 seconds

26:38.760 --> 26:40.990
than I've seen
in the prior two years,

26:41.120 --> 26:42.314
but you are delusional

26:43.000 --> 26:45.036
if you think you can
survive without me.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.519
If we butt heads on this,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.795
don't think I'll show you
any compassion.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.748
And with that in mind,

26:52.880 --> 26:55.553
I will give you a final
opportunity to reconsider.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.198
All right. I'm off to say my goodbye
to the money-man.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.790
When this town guts you
like a trout

27:13.880 --> 27:15.950
and chokes you
with your own entrails,

27:16.040 --> 27:18.110
don't come sniveling to me.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.393
We'll come back

27:21.560 --> 27:23.596
to the Asian Republic
of Indonesia later,

27:25.360 --> 27:27.555
but, you see, what troubles me

27:27.640 --> 27:30.712
is the amount
of influence you had.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.917
We've seen communications

27:33.040 --> 27:35.713
from senior figures
in Washington

27:36.240 --> 27:39.755
who feared that you,
a lobbyist,

27:40.400 --> 27:43.073
could destroy their careers
with a snap of your fingers.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.832
Is this reputation something

27:46.920 --> 27:48.273
you've cultivated,
Miss Sloane?

27:50.240 --> 27:51.468
Upon the advice of counsel,

27:51.560 --> 27:53.600
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

27:53.760 --> 27:55.480
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

27:55.520 --> 27:57.351
to the United States
Constitution.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.272
You see, it's bad enough
one person

27:59.360 --> 28:01.191
having that much influence,

28:01.680 --> 28:05.434
but if they're out of control,
if she has a problem,

28:06.600 --> 28:08.830
an addiction, well,

28:10.120 --> 28:12.315
it would be like the ship
of American politics

28:12.720 --> 28:14.119
is being steered by a drunk.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.797
Do you, or have you ever had,

28:20.200 --> 28:22.111
any problems with
substance abuse?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.119
Upon the advice of counsel,

28:24.200 --> 28:26.634
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

28:26.760 --> 28:28.480
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

28:28.600 --> 28:29.920
to the United States
Constitution.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.120
I understand you have difficulty sleeping?

28:36.120 --> 28:39.112
We subpoenaed medical records.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.638
You're a long-time sufferer
from chronic insomnia.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.471
You regularly work
over 16 hours a day.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.592
But you can't get off
to sleep. Is this accurate?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.309
Upon the advice of counsel,
I respectfully...

28:55.400 --> 28:57.630
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

28:57.760 --> 28:59.637
based on my rights under

28:59.720 --> 29:01.400
the Fifth Amendment
of the United States...

29:01.440 --> 29:02.634
To the Constitution.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.074
Whatever.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.680
You were prescribed

29:06.080 --> 29:10.312
multiple courses
of benzodiazepines,

29:10.960 --> 29:12.096
but according to
the deposition

29:12.120 --> 29:13.394
of one of our witnesses,

29:13.520 --> 29:16.592
you've been procuring,
off-prescription,

29:16.680 --> 29:18.750
a course of psycho-stimulants,

29:19.160 --> 29:23.597
with the aim of keeping you
awake a little longer.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.793
Is this true?

29:26.800 --> 29:28.199
Miss Sloane?

29:30.480 --> 29:31.560
Upon the advice of counsel,

29:31.600 --> 29:33.416
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

29:33.440 --> 29:34.976
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

29:35.000 --> 29:36.672
to the United States
Constitution.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.670
Okay. Getting back
to this business

29:40.760 --> 29:42.352
of the Asian Republic
of Indonesia...

29:42.480 --> 29:43.959
I am not a drug addict,

29:44.040 --> 29:46.190
and this line of questioning
has no revel...

29:46.280 --> 29:47.793
Relevance in this case.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.518
My medication doesn't
affect my judgment

29:49.640 --> 29:51.278
any more than
a double espresso.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.555
And speaking of intoxication,

29:53.680 --> 29:55.113
I can recite from memory

29:55.200 --> 29:57.634
a list of upstanding,
elected Senators

29:57.720 --> 30:01.030
who voted on legislation
while severely inebriated.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.555
And just so you know,
I think, by now,

30:03.880 --> 30:05.029
we are fully aware,

30:05.160 --> 30:07.310
and in no danger
of forgetting,

30:07.400 --> 30:09.630
that Indonesia is a republic,

30:09.720 --> 30:13.554
which happens to be situated
on the continent of Asia.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.869
Miss Sloane.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.073
Welcome to the party.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.913
Five years.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.874
Was it really worth it?

30:32.600 --> 30:34.397
- Five years minimum.
- What's five years?

30:34.560 --> 30:37.757
All for some puerile quip
about Indonesia being in Asia.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.510
Can't you see that whole
construct was designed to...

30:42.600 --> 30:43.600
And it worked.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.072
Are you gonna tell me
what five years is?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.355
You fell for it.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.678
The smartest operative
on the Hill

30:49.760 --> 30:51.352
just got played
by Grampa Simpson!

30:51.440 --> 30:52.536
Is it how long
this conversation's

30:52.560 --> 30:53.595
gonna feel like?

30:53.680 --> 30:56.592
It's the going rate for
perjury before Congress.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.920
Now you've
thrown out the Fifth,

30:57.960 --> 30:59.359
anyone who wants you
in the ground,

30:59.440 --> 31:01.874
and that's a lot of people,
they're hard at work

31:01.960 --> 31:04.190
dedicating their creative
and intellectual efforts

31:04.280 --> 31:05.599
to catching you in a lie.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.109
Well, what if I just
stay silent?

31:08.520 --> 31:10.112
Well, that's a great idea.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.856
Shit, why didn't your lawyer
think of that?

31:11.880 --> 31:13.029
If I refuse to answer...

31:13.120 --> 31:14.189
They'll throw you in jail

31:14.280 --> 31:15.713
- for contempt of Congress!
- Shh!

31:16.440 --> 31:18.351
You've just blown
this thing wide open!

31:18.480 --> 31:19.549
Calm down, Daniel.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.440
You're starting
to look like you care.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.629
No.

31:22.760 --> 31:23.760
I don't care about you

31:23.800 --> 31:25.080
any further than
I can throw you.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.234
I work for the one ethical
lobbying practice on the Hill,

31:28.320 --> 31:30.550
and I wind up defending
the poster child

31:30.640 --> 31:32.039
for the most morally bankrupt

31:32.160 --> 31:33.360
profession since
faith healing.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.296
Your car's downstairs.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.995
Go home, stare at the ceiling,
get ready to be crucified.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.216
I know I don't have
the most stellar record

31:46.240 --> 31:47.309
in heeding your advice...

31:47.440 --> 31:48.998
Don't perjure yourself!

31:56.160 --> 31:58.240
Too bad things didn't
pan out with Elizabeth.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.158
Oh, we have other options.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.831
What the hell is
"Amish chicken"?

32:03.960 --> 32:05.518
A marketing exercise?

32:05.840 --> 32:08.400
No, we'll just try and find
ourselves another lobbyist.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.275
I was talking about
the Amish chicken.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
Oh.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.599
She's your enemy now.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.591
I invited you here
because nobody

32:18.680 --> 32:20.830
is better placed
to neutralize her than us.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.160
We worked together for years.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.518
We know exactly
how she operates.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.873
Oh, that is just
a regular bird

32:29.960 --> 32:31.336
raised in Amish country,
by the way.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.360
Ah.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.120
It tastes better because
it can't use Google, huh?

32:38.880 --> 32:40.176
Look, there's over
five million of us.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.349
And we're armed.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.116
We've beaten
this kind of bill before,

32:44.200 --> 32:45.679
we'll beat it again.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.952
They'll make a lot of noise,

32:48.040 --> 32:51.191
they'll wave their banners,
but in the end

32:51.320 --> 32:52.514
it's so predictable.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.558
She's not predictable.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.231
She aims to surprise.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.280
She'll share things
with her team,

33:02.360 --> 33:03.560
but she won't
share everything.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.638
She'll have a plan
for certain people,

33:05.720 --> 33:07.472
but they won't know
until they're dropped

33:07.560 --> 33:08.680
right into the middle of it.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.896
There's always something
else going on with her.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.069
It's just how she works.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.196
We have a good idea
which Senators she'll go for

33:15.160 --> 33:16.388
and we can get in first.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.752
And they're vulnerable
on other members

33:18.840 --> 33:19.896
they're already counting on.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.035
Badgley, Michigan.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.876
He can bring maybe six votes.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.231
We get to him,
it's a quick win.

33:31.840 --> 33:32.909
All right.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.079
Show me some tradecraft.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.115
- Filet mignon, rare.
- Same, well done.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.954
Well done too.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.355
The Arctic char.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.238
Amish chicken salad, please.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.239
Excuse me.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.114
That kind of insight is
exactly why you're here.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.909
I'm sorry,
who closed him again?

34:16.400 --> 34:17.753
Who the hell are you?

34:18.400 --> 34:19.674
Evening, ma'am.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.798
What happened to
the usual guy? Mark.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.718
If that's his real name.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.718
Mark's moved on.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.474
Call me Forde.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.954
Is that your real name?

34:34.480 --> 34:35.549
Is to you.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.832
- How about you, gorgeous?
- Oh, God.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.151
You a politico, or one of
these corporate-types?

34:42.400 --> 34:44.550
What brings a fine lady
like you to room 904?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.468
Not the conversation.
How much you had to drink?

34:48.640 --> 34:51.074
Well, a free minibar,
I'd say not nearly enough.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.832
You're not allowed
to smoke in here.

34:54.240 --> 34:55.880
You're not allowed
to buy company in here,

34:55.920 --> 34:57.273
yet here you are.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.679
Smoke is detectable.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.831
It could draw attention.
It is unprofessional.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.188
Okay.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.036
Corporate-type. Lawyer, maybe.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.348
If we're going to proceed,

35:06.480 --> 35:08.038
I require
a certain standard of...

35:08.120 --> 35:09.314
Agency rules, lady.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.040
Payment in cash,
I'm the only one

35:11.120 --> 35:12.880
to know this little party
here ever happened.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.116
And that's with half a minibar
down my gullet.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.680
I understand if you were
looking for something else.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.233
You'll do fine.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.989
Let's get to the point.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.628
All right.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.840
Hey, I hope you guys don't
feel like you're slumming.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.553
I thought it'd be weirder.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.631
Bean bags,
couple swings, maybe.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.336
At least tell me you guys
have shower rooms.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.998
Cole Kravitz had shower rooms?

35:50.080 --> 35:51.176
Clients felt like
they needed one

35:51.200 --> 35:52.315
after 30 minutes with him.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.630
We had all the facilities,
and no time to use them.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.720
This'll do fine.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.598
The vending machine
downstairs is weird.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.040
Wouldn't give me my beverage

35:59.080 --> 36:00.640
until I told it my gender
and age range.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.159
The vending machine
company sells

36:02.240 --> 36:03.456
our personal details
to Big Advertising.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.311
I already posted a complaint.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.594
It's okay, I just lied.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.233
You told it you were
an adult male?

36:08.360 --> 36:09.918
Why are you
so horrible to him?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.752
Jacobs just pulled
the Nutella Tax.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.440
- When did that happen?
- I just got it.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.560
The tax on palm oil?
You're the ones who killed it?

36:15.600 --> 36:16.669
Dead with the dodo.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.016
Along with how many
other unique species

36:18.040 --> 36:19.200
in the Indonesian rainforest?

36:19.280 --> 36:20.599
Not your greatest
analogy there.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.480
I guess it should
be up to them,

36:22.520 --> 36:24.192
I mean, it is, after all,
their country.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.256
Do you know how much pollution
their slashing and burning

36:26.280 --> 36:27.429
pumps into the atmosphere?

36:27.520 --> 36:30.353
Less than 0.2% of global
greenhouse emissions.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.590
- So, are the rumors true?
- Yes.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.278
Ross is really a woman.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.035
Is Sloane the personification
of an ice cube?

36:37.120 --> 36:38.519
She pees standing up.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.556
And, like...
I don't even do that.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.199
Do you think before you speak?

36:42.280 --> 36:43.793
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36:43.920 --> 36:44.955
- Morning.
- Morning.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.640
I was thinking, perhaps,
we go around the table,

36:47.760 --> 36:48.954
introduce ourselves.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.632
Let's spare ourselves
the tedium.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.029
If you want to break the ice,
do it with insight.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.712
We're all here to ensure
safe passage

36:54.800 --> 36:56.950
of the Heaton-Harris Bill
into Federal law.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.794
How do we do it?

37:00.600 --> 37:01.919
Realistically, we don't.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.473
We fight as hard as we can,

37:04.600 --> 37:06.158
build a strong base
of support,

37:06.240 --> 37:07.389
so we have a better chance

37:07.480 --> 37:09.056
when they introduce
next year's Heaton-Harris,

37:09.080 --> 37:10.149
or the one after that.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.468
I didn't just move across town

37:11.600 --> 37:13.216
with the aim of losing
as slowly as possible.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.559
Name and seniority?

37:15.280 --> 37:17.316
Esme Manucharian, nine years.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.237
Manucharian,
I've heard that name.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.631
Esme's our authority
on gun control.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.416
When it comes
to facts and figures,

37:23.440 --> 37:24.475
she has no equal.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.999
You led the fight to preserve

37:26.120 --> 37:27.678
the concealed carry ban
in Illinois.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.913
Ultimately unsuccessfully,
but, yes.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.559
Okay, Esme.
Why are we going to lose?

37:33.520 --> 37:35.909
For every dollar Brady spends
on campaign contributions,

37:36.000 --> 37:37.376
you know how much
the gun lobby spends?

37:37.400 --> 37:38.600
- Thirty-eight.
- Thirty-eight.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.750
So, politicians bow
to money. But, why?

37:41.840 --> 37:43.910
It's not going into their
pocket, that'd be bribery.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.080
Like what the Indonesians
just did to Senator Jacobs?

37:46.200 --> 37:47.456
That was legal bribery

37:47.480 --> 37:48.993
for educational purposes.
But, yes.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.634
A senator's priority
isn't representing the people,

37:51.840 --> 37:53.159
it's keeping his ass
in office.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.440
That is so cynical.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.176
"Cynical" is a word
used by Pollyannas

37:56.200 --> 37:58.031
to denote an absence
of the naivety

37:58.160 --> 37:59.991
they so keenly exhibit.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.475
Wow. You settle in fast.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.109
If senators only care about
protecting their position,

38:06.480 --> 38:08.869
wouldn't that make them
slaves to public opinion?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.116
Polling data puts
a majority of Americans

38:11.200 --> 38:12.428
in favor of Heaton-Harris.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.676
And that's exactly why
you keep losing.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.816
Well, this is actually
our first crack at guns,

38:16.840 --> 38:17.875
but I take your point.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.194
What point?

38:19.320 --> 38:20.958
Public opinion is overrated.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.952
Midterm re-election rates
for senators was 82%.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.792
Voter turnout was 36.

38:25.880 --> 38:26.976
And I'll bet most of them were

38:27.000 --> 38:28.319
paid-up members
of the gun lobby.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.469
Thank you.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.312
Our opposition has created
a base of voters,

38:31.400 --> 38:32.879
vast and fanatical,

38:32.960 --> 38:34.234
who go out and vote
exclusively

38:34.360 --> 38:35.395
on the issue of guns.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.600
How do we compete with that?

38:36.680 --> 38:38.238
We build our own base
of supporters,

38:38.320 --> 38:39.456
who demonstrate a willingness

38:39.480 --> 38:42.313
to get their asses into booths
and vote against guns.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.160
What's the best indicator
of voter intention?

38:44.240 --> 38:45.309
- Money!
- Finance!

38:45.400 --> 38:46.753
That's our first prong.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.239
Grassroots action

38:48.320 --> 38:49.840
aimed squarely at
soliciting donations.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.868
Not names on a petition,
not clicks in cyberspace.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.216
Will they know
how much we're raising?

38:54.240 --> 38:56.231
Non-profits have to
report on their finances.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.999
And every
Congressional staffer

38:58.080 --> 38:59.280
watches filing day
like a hawk.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.594
While you're
out there hustling,

39:00.720 --> 39:02.153
I'll be working
influential senators

39:02.240 --> 39:03.912
who can deliver
their colleagues' votes.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.513
That's our second prong.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.158
Our third is to identify

39:07.280 --> 39:09.271
who holds sway
in target states.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.277
Employers, workers' groups.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.749
Don't just waltz into
a senator's office

39:13.840 --> 39:15.114
and make your case.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.792
Find out who they trust,

39:17.040 --> 39:19.508
who they can't afford
to piss off.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.478
Convince that person
to make your case.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.398
That is how we win.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.278
Not a driver?

39:34.840 --> 39:35.909
I can, but I don't.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.359
Well, you got further than me,
I don't even have a license.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.277
My bank account
and liberal conscience

39:41.360 --> 39:42.713
won't justify my own car.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.075
What's your excuse?

39:45.320 --> 39:47.117
To be honest, I suck at it.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.232
I took my test when I was 16.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.878
Only exam I ever failed.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.395
My instructor told me
I was reckless,

39:53.480 --> 39:55.311
I lacked due care
and attention.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.870
Knew then and there
I had a career in politics.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.318
You weren't
messing around in there.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.789
Did you know someone?

40:06.240 --> 40:07.616
Someone who was
a victim of gun violence.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.153
No, why does everyone
assume that?

40:09.840 --> 40:11.159
Strong opinions, maybe?

40:11.280 --> 40:13.056
As if I can only see
the merits of an argument

40:13.080 --> 40:14.991
when I feel the effects
personally.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.233
There was a Congressman,
I don't remember his name,

40:18.320 --> 40:20.629
his whole career
he was against gay rights,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.673
only to do a complete U-turn
when his brother came out.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.360
What a well-reasoned
basis for an opinion.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.477
Give him a gavel,
put him in a courthouse.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.040
Are you hungry?

40:40.800 --> 40:42.836
You eat here
every night?

40:43.920 --> 40:45.717
Pretty much.
Place never closes.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.359
How do you
not get bored of it?

40:48.840 --> 40:49.875
It's a necessity.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.120
It's like asking if I get
bored of going to the toilet.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.636
Okay, this is going to
sound alien to you,

40:55.720 --> 40:58.792
but food takes up an inordinate
amount of space in my head.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.554
How about guns?

41:04.120 --> 41:06.040
In doing my due diligence,
your résumé stood out.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.591
I noticed a lot of your work
pertains to firearms.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.477
I'm guessing that was
a conscious decision

41:10.560 --> 41:12.278
to steer things
in that direction.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.275
It's an issue I feel
strongly about.

41:20.760 --> 41:21.829
It's none of my business,

41:21.920 --> 41:23.320
but there was a gap
in your profile.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.631
Before Berkeley,
you attended high school

41:25.720 --> 41:27.392
in Bloomington, Indiana,
in the late '90s.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.916
The name of the school
isn't listed.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.999
Who else knows about this?

41:40.400 --> 41:42.516
Rodolfo. That's all.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.456
You can imagine
what I'm thinking.

41:46.480 --> 41:50.871
I'm sorry, Elizabeth,
but I earned my reputation.

41:52.280 --> 41:53.336
It didn't come from something

41:53.360 --> 41:54.656
that happened when
I was in high school.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.671
Even if my views did.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.376
Going public could even
weaken my standing.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.879
They'll say I'm too emotional.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.759
Anyway, the shooters
didn't even buy their guns.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.239
Heaton-Harris
wouldn't have made

42:06.320 --> 42:07.520
a shred of
difference that day.

42:08.640 --> 42:12.155
You fear a weakened standing
will damage your ability to effect change.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.471
But if acknowledging it
was the difference

42:14.560 --> 42:16.118
between winning and losing?

42:19.840 --> 42:21.637
I'd appreciate it
if you just treated me

42:21.720 --> 42:22.948
as one of the team.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.515
A highly competent one,
I can tell.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.349
We're lucky to have you.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.029
Sixty is the magic number.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.031
Sixty votes
breaks a filibuster.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.758
So, the gun lobby
wins with 41?

42:39.840 --> 42:41.353
They could win
with fewer.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.159
We need to hit 60.
Anything less doesn't cut it.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.594
Fifty-nine doesn't cut it.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.236
We need 60 senators
to show up and vote.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.392
We don't get that,
they win, period.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.514
As I was saying...

42:54.720 --> 42:56.517
That by my reckoning,
the gun lobby

42:56.600 --> 42:59.273
has 34 votes
pretty much locked.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.874
And that's this side.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.834
I'd say we have 44 locked
over here on this side.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.880
That leaves 22
that are still in play.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.509
These fine ladies and
gentlemen in the middle.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.068
Heaton-Harris, provisionally,

43:11.160 --> 43:13.151
makes it to the floor
in 84 days.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.148
The good news is,

43:15.280 --> 43:17.316
if we can lock 16,
we're over the line.

43:17.560 --> 43:18.834
I'm sorry,
that's the good news?

43:19.120 --> 43:20.678
We need 16 out of 22 votes?

43:21.080 --> 43:22.976
That's like sitting an exam
where the passing grade is...

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
72%.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.680
And the bad news
is that the gun lobby

43:25.720 --> 43:27.233
is rich beyond
our wildest dreams?

43:27.320 --> 43:28.320
There is that.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.136
Or that it's not
a whole lot of time

43:30.160 --> 43:32.256
to steal 16 votes from the
most powerful group in D.C.?

43:32.280 --> 43:33.429
That, too.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.875
What Ross is fumbling for is,
we need 16.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.553
They only need seven.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.435
Shit.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.709
...and the man who did this

43:43.800 --> 43:48.191
robbed us of their smiles,
of their laughter.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.392
And I just can't accept
that we allowed it to happen.

43:55.760 --> 44:00.515
Our beautiful girls,
and we could have stopped it.

44:00.600 --> 44:01.828
We could have taken the gun

44:01.920 --> 44:03.160
out of his hand
and my babies...

44:03.240 --> 44:04.798
Jesus Christ.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.880
We get the idea.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.116
Brenda and Joel Patterson.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.713
The shooting sparked
a new wave

44:10.800 --> 44:12.438
of anti-gun sentiment
in Wisconsin.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.176
And that was
more than a month ago.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.235
It's not dying down.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.151
Brenda's become
a prominent figure

44:17.240 --> 44:18.720
in the Mothers Demand
Action movement.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.758
Public outrage
after a gun attack

44:20.840 --> 44:23.559
lasts maybe
a week per casualty.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.194
This whole Pattinson story
should be in the ground by now.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.316
- Patterson.
- Huh?

44:28.400 --> 44:30.470
Their name.
The Patterson family.

44:30.560 --> 44:32.920
I don't give a shit if they're
the fucking Partridge Family.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.228
This is her.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.560
Sandford
needs to know.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.955
Our delivery must be tailored
for maximum impact.

44:39.040 --> 44:42.032
Support for gun control is up
8% in the last two weeks.

44:42.120 --> 44:43.951
Both Wisconsin senators
are vulnerable.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.758
If they don't declare
for Heaton-Harris,

44:45.840 --> 44:47.456
Kirkpatrick won't make it
through the fall,

44:47.480 --> 44:48.656
and Wallace is toast
in two years...

44:48.680 --> 44:50.113
Who's going to that
medical thing?

44:52.280 --> 44:53.280
Senator Wallace.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.998
He can deliver
two other moderates.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.913
And sure as she was
born screaming,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.639
she'll see that as her chance
to box them in.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.478
No, Carlos,
that's unacceptable.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.552
The media has to be there,
that's the whole point.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.148
It has to be digitally stored
and ready to be trotted out

45:08.240 --> 45:10.674
should he even think
about backing down.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.512
I'm gonna send you a photo
of Clara Thomson.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.999
She'll be front-left,
wearing a...

45:14.080 --> 45:15.136
Clara, what are you wearing?

45:15.160 --> 45:16.256
One-shoulder
black crepe dress.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.111
A one-shoulder
black crepe dress.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.160
If we're lucky, it'll be
the only one in the room.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.394
Thanks, Carlos.

45:21.480 --> 45:23.869
Hey, Alex, tell me
it's feasible that a doctor

45:23.960 --> 45:26.080
wouldn't have time for all
this social media bullshit.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.430
Yeah, if you're pulling
15-hour shifts, I guess.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.635
Great.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.000
But he'd be on
Doximity probably.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.913
The Medical version
of LinkedIn.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.936
Could you not have just
stopped when I said "great"?

45:34.960 --> 45:36.359
Good morning.

45:36.760 --> 45:37.760
Light reading?

45:38.440 --> 45:40.670
Do you even know
what pulmonology is?

45:40.800 --> 45:41.915
Yes, I do.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.919
It's the study of pulmon.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.656
Lungs are asymmetrical.
Right has three lobes, left two.

45:46.680 --> 45:47.680
You know why?

45:47.720 --> 45:48.976
Your heart needs
the real estate?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.069
Bravo.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.673
All right, everybody,
listen up!

45:51.760 --> 45:53.320
Not a problem for you,
I should imagine.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.678
What have they got? Come on!
Arguments and rebuttals.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.159
Let's have it, wake up!

45:59.240 --> 46:02.198
It's the first step toward a
national register of firearms.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.635
Scare mongering.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.976
No one's even come close
to proposing that.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.479
And if they did,

46:06.560 --> 46:08.391
it would have its own day
in Congress. Next.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.435
And it's two steps away
from confiscation.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.736
The gun lobby's rhetoric
is based on the falsehood

46:13.760 --> 46:16.752
that we want to take something
away from people. We don't.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.159
We want to make it
more difficult

46:18.240 --> 46:21.073
for dangerous people
to buy firearms.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.513
If we can't burst
this fallacy,

46:22.600 --> 46:23.999
we may as well go home.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.736
Esme, get me a bio
on Wendy Furniss, please?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.194
- Sure.
- Harwood Norton's CEO?

46:28.280 --> 46:30.016
Mmm-hmm. Second largest
employer in Virginia.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.314
Both senators are teetering,

46:31.400 --> 46:33.120
but if I can get her
to reach out to them...

46:33.360 --> 46:34.360
You don't see the irony

46:34.440 --> 46:36.112
in asking the CEO
of a defense contractor

46:36.200 --> 46:37.400
to advocate for a ban on guns?

46:37.840 --> 46:38.896
We're not banning anything!

46:38.920 --> 46:40.016
Jesus, you sound like
one of them.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.155
I'm in character.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.355
Next!

46:42.440 --> 46:43.640
Uh, the new rules
will increase

46:43.920 --> 46:45.194
wait times by two weeks.

46:45.320 --> 46:46.520
Welcome to America,

46:46.800 --> 46:48.376
where you'll wait
six months for an X-ray,

46:48.400 --> 46:50.072
but, hey, you can buy an AR-15

46:50.200 --> 46:51.872
in five minutes flat.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.120
You going to be
that flippant in public?

46:54.240 --> 46:55.856
Pussyfooting isn't memorable.
Sound bites are.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.110
And the appropriate one
goes like this,

46:58.200 --> 47:01.192
anyone that desperate
to get their hands on a gun

47:01.280 --> 47:03.669
shouldn't be allowed
anywhere near one.

47:03.760 --> 47:06.354
The total number of
MRI machines in Wisconsin...

47:06.440 --> 47:08.680
If the good Senator
ever finishes this speech,

47:08.720 --> 47:09.994
he will open it to the floor.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.360
You'll be question number three.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.278
You think he'll go for it?

47:13.600 --> 47:14.680
He knows the media is here,

47:14.760 --> 47:16.751
won't risk being heckled
at his own fundraiser.

47:16.840 --> 47:19.115
Back him into a corner,
and he'll have no choice.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.031
...of an additional $2 million

47:21.120 --> 47:23.793
for the purchase of
four brand-new machines

47:23.880 --> 47:26.394
within the first year
of my next term.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.232
Thank you.

47:28.320 --> 47:31.357
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.193
All right,
a few more questions

47:33.280 --> 47:34.759
for the Senator,
then we'll wrap up.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.394
Uh, yes, the lady in white.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.677
Mr. Senator, I'm Chair of
the Westfield Center...

47:40.520 --> 47:42.715
He was supposed to go to me third,
what's he doing?

47:43.080 --> 47:44.718
Followi ng orders.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.112
Three tables behind you,
two to the right.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.518
They've been tracking us
through Wisconsin.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.456
They would have had everyone
on that list vetted.

47:51.480 --> 47:52.913
You're blown.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.274
What do you mean?

47:54.520 --> 47:56.954
I mean that it's time
for plan B.

47:58.640 --> 48:03.191
And our final question
goes to Dr. Raj Amarasekara.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.960
I hope
I'm pronouncing that right.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.917
Of the Pulmonary
Associates of America.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.274
Thank you.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.176
Raj Amarasekara
is a working actor

48:11.200 --> 48:12.599
named Matthew Kantaria.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.557
They think he's about to
ask a benign question

48:14.640 --> 48:15.840
about the
clean air initiative.

48:16.160 --> 48:19.152
...it's a safe bet we'll see
three or four gunshot victims.

48:19.840 --> 48:22.400
Some are kids, teenagers.

48:23.480 --> 48:26.040
How do you intend to vote
on the Heaton-Harris Bill

48:26.120 --> 48:28.236
when it's put before Congress?

48:31.720 --> 48:33.358
Well...

48:33.440 --> 48:36.079
As you have experienced, uh,

48:37.160 --> 48:39.310
gun violence
is a real problem...

48:39.640 --> 48:40.959
You decoyed me?

48:41.040 --> 48:43.270
Raj Amarasekara has
personally plagiarized

48:43.360 --> 48:46.557
seven research papers,
all available online.

48:46.640 --> 48:47.993
He even has
a Doximity account.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.548
...financial burden
is the fact that

48:50.640 --> 48:53.200
some of the victims
are the, um...

48:53.680 --> 48:54.715
Kids.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.754
The young.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.513
So, I think it's,
uh, first and foremost,

49:00.600 --> 49:05.390
to put our sympathies with
the families of these victims.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.590
But it's true, gun violence
puts an enormous strain

49:10.680 --> 49:14.150
on our healthcare system
and its work force.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.757
Absolutely, yes.

49:16.840 --> 49:19.877
That's why I intend to give
my whole-hearted support

49:21.240 --> 49:22.753
to the Heaton-Harris Bill.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.719
And that's a wrap.

49:26.600 --> 49:29.637
Thank you.
Absolutely, thank you.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.440
Who else does he bring?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.518
Fascitelli and Garcia.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.239
Hey, Esme, I have a surprise
for you on Wednesday.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.198
We're going to
a new restaurant?

49:48.520 --> 49:50.715
How about a Second Amendment
debate at NYU Law School?

49:52.040 --> 49:53.553
Don't shout this
from the rooftops,

49:53.920 --> 49:55.216
but I trust you
to do a better job

49:55.240 --> 49:56.468
than anyone else on the team.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.913
You can't make it?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.309
I'm including myself
as part of the team.

50:00.520 --> 50:01.873
I wasn't cool enough to relate

50:01.960 --> 50:03.560
to college kids
when I was a college kid.

50:04.360 --> 50:05.588
I'll forward you the details.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.235
You again.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.673
I called them and I
specifically asked for Mark.

50:16.360 --> 50:18.080
And I specifically told you
he skipped town.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.472
Well, what agency
did he move to?

50:20.920 --> 50:22.319
How should I know?

50:22.400 --> 50:24.200
I ain't his parole officer.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.555
He's in trouble?

50:26.640 --> 50:27.709
I was kidding.

50:30.480 --> 50:33.392
Aww, we had so much fun
the other night.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.672
Well, you know
where the door is, lady.

50:37.760 --> 50:38.875
Go run to your Mark.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.553
I've got work to do tonight.

51:24.840 --> 51:26.159
Big case?

51:26.400 --> 51:28.197
Forde, human interaction
is an exchange.

51:28.520 --> 51:29.953
My money for your...

51:30.160 --> 51:31.160
Dick?

51:31.280 --> 51:33.032
I was gonna say "skill set."

51:33.600 --> 51:35.989
But that's the only exchange
I'm willing to make.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.118
Now you sound like a banker.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.759
I got to do prep anyways.

51:40.840 --> 51:41.909
For what?

51:42.400 --> 51:44.675
Another client,
tomorrow night.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.913
You do prep?

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
For functions.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.154
Believe it or not,

51:51.680 --> 51:55.150
not everyone hires me
for my skill set.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.840
Half my clients just
want me on their arm.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.336
Some just want
someone to talk to

51:59.360 --> 52:00.456
from a different neck
of the woods,

52:00.480 --> 52:02.835
- who ain't gonna judge them.
- That is so pathetic.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.035
Functions are different.

52:04.840 --> 52:06.717
The agency gave me
a list of covers.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.719
Insurance exec, marketing guy.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.280
Tomorrow is oil and gas.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.075
I'll be seeing you.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.517
I think you owe me
something more.

52:18.600 --> 52:19.874
No, it's all there. Count it.

52:20.280 --> 52:21.713
This covers my services.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.696
But I just gave you
a whole lot of information

52:24.720 --> 52:25.720
about my line of work.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.336
On your principles
of exchange...

52:27.360 --> 52:28.360
Oh, my God!

52:28.440 --> 52:30.556
Okay, that was a voluntary
donation on your part.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.553
I pay you so I can
imagine a life I chose

52:34.640 --> 52:36.471
to forego in the pursuit
of my career.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.056
So, why don't you
go out and get it?

52:39.080 --> 52:40.160
It's not for me.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.416
Not when I was
in my early 20s,

52:41.440 --> 52:42.509
and sure as hell not now.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.354
So, "no house you call home,

52:44.440 --> 52:45.520
"no folks you call family,"

52:45.640 --> 52:46.914
- sort of thing, huh?
- Uh-uh.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.036
- You ever regret that?
- Not for a second.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.240
At least now
we're peeling a layer.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.273
And that is all my principles
of exchange will allow.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.598
Goodbye, Forde.

53:16.400 --> 53:17.616
If you're a terrorist,

53:17.640 --> 53:19.710
or someone who shouldn't
be allowed on that plane,

53:19.840 --> 53:21.376
which lane are you
going to walk through?

53:21.400 --> 53:22.549
Yeah, well, obviously...

53:22.640 --> 53:23.959
Thursday morning.

53:24.040 --> 53:25.040
Okay, I'll hold.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.874
- Lauren! Boston, Thursday!
- Got it!

53:29.080 --> 53:31.753
I deleted every vestige
of my online existence.

53:31.840 --> 53:32.955
You didn't replace it,

53:33.040 --> 53:34.256
leaving a Clara-sized
hole in Google,

53:34.280 --> 53:35.998
which they flagged
in due diligence.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.399
I did replace it.

53:37.600 --> 53:38.794
Esme!

53:40.560 --> 53:43.028
Clara Thomson just returned
from a 2-year stint

53:43.120 --> 53:45.190
with Médecins Sans Frontières.
It was solid.

53:46.080 --> 53:49.277
Why didn't you tell me
about Raj...

53:49.360 --> 53:50.679
Just call him Matthew.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.193
I checked with Finance.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.456
Your actor wasn't
paid from our account.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.152
You ran him out
of your own pocket.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.400
It's good practice
to keep your circle small.

53:59.760 --> 54:01.136
In this town,
no matter where you are,

54:01.160 --> 54:03.040
you're never more than
two feet away from a rat.

54:04.960 --> 54:08.430
Hey! I want you on the podium
at the ARS dinner.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.599
Wait, that's a huge deal.

54:10.680 --> 54:11.736
You don't think
we should share

54:11.760 --> 54:12.856
the public speaking a little?

54:12.880 --> 54:14.560
And blow all the goodwill
you've racked up?

54:14.640 --> 54:16.949
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
in the spotlight.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.040
Doing all the press.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.600
Get comfortable,
that ship has sailed.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.991
Hey, yes. Thursday morning,
I'll be there.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.056
Every day,
48 children or teens are shot.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.593
That's not across
the world, folks,

54:27.680 --> 54:29.079
that's right here in America.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.496
We are joined right now
by a representative

54:30.520 --> 54:31.635
from the Brady Campaign,

54:31.880 --> 54:35.350
- Esme Manchurian.
- It's Manucharian.

54:35.800 --> 54:38.598
Knocking on doors,
making house calls?

54:40.240 --> 54:41.736
How long did it take you
to even get to this place?

54:41.760 --> 54:43.120
Consider it a sign
of how important

54:43.440 --> 54:44.759
it is that we get you
on board.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.040
Why?

54:46.200 --> 54:47.758
In your long and
distinguished career,

54:47.840 --> 54:49.910
you've done precisely
jack-shit for feminism.

54:50.400 --> 54:51.799
Because gender
doesn't interest me.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.196
The only thing
you're missing is a dick.

54:54.280 --> 54:56.032
I think
your presence in the room

54:56.120 --> 54:57.951
would be a great help

54:58.040 --> 55:00.270
as I make our case
to Senator Hofland.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.640
God willing,
we can help protect

55:01.720 --> 55:04.553
our neighbors from the kind of tragedy
America has endured...

55:04.640 --> 55:08.394
Esme... Manchurian.

55:08.640 --> 55:09.868
Manucharian.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.714
In this country,
nine women are shot

55:13.880 --> 55:15.576
and killed by their intimate
partners every week.

55:15.600 --> 55:18.398
The risk of homicide
goes up 500%...

55:18.480 --> 55:20.710
Don't hurl stats at me,
I'm not a fucking journalist.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.479
You think
I don't know all this?

55:23.560 --> 55:24.595
Does your membership?

55:24.680 --> 55:26.636
Because now would be
a great time to tell them.

55:27.480 --> 55:29.152
Larsson and Parr
have donated

55:29.240 --> 55:30.576
millions of
their personal fortunes.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.511
- Yeah.
- I can't go hat-in-hand for more.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.355
Hey, Manchurian!

55:34.440 --> 55:36.829
Mandel's on the brink,
I need conversational topics.

55:36.920 --> 55:38.638
- What do you mean?
- Small talk.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.950
Idle nonsense of no import
to anything.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.951
You outsource
your social interactions?

55:43.040 --> 55:45.315
Yeah. Interests,
hobbies... Kids!

55:46.680 --> 55:47.776
There's no better way
to butter up a parent

55:47.800 --> 55:49.280
than to tell him
how hot his kids are.

55:49.320 --> 55:50.355
On it.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.960
The last time we met,
your youngest was

55:52.000 --> 55:53.956
knocking on the door
of the Ivy League.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.268
- Yes.
- Logan, was it?

55:55.360 --> 55:57.240
Christ! I can't even remember
that conversation.

55:57.400 --> 55:59.136
Mandy Hamlyn from the American
Nurses Association

55:59.160 --> 56:00.160
- on line three!
- Ah!

56:00.240 --> 56:01.656
I think there are
a great many on the Hill

56:01.680 --> 56:03.696
who have become so accustomed
to your generous support,

56:03.720 --> 56:05.720
it wouldn't hurt to give them
a short, sharp shock.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.914
Your donors, don't ask
for more. Ask for less.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.616
If you feel strongly
about Heaton-Harris,

56:10.640 --> 56:11.834
you could do worse

56:11.920 --> 56:13.496
than to pledge to cut ties
to any senator

56:13.520 --> 56:14.720
who doesn't come out in favor.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.756
So, what, we're
turning the screw,

56:16.840 --> 56:18.637
and saving money
at the same time?

56:19.120 --> 56:20.656
I don't want to
live in a society where there

56:20.680 --> 56:22.511
is a new school shooting
every week!

56:24.640 --> 56:27.438
That is why when put to vote,

56:27.520 --> 56:29.909
I will be supporting
the Heaton-Harris Bill!

56:33.360 --> 56:34.395
It came in anonymously,

56:34.480 --> 56:35.736
but everyone's
thinking Bloomberg.

56:35.760 --> 56:38.558
Five hundred grand?
That's over 12% of our budget!

56:38.640 --> 56:39.736
If you were donating
that much,

56:39.760 --> 56:40.896
why would you do it
anonymously?

56:40.920 --> 56:41.955
Obvious reason.

56:42.040 --> 56:44.395
- What? Privacy?
- No.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.630
It makes you look noble
when you leak your identity.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.075
Oh, my God.
Were you born that cynical?

56:49.160 --> 56:51.116
That is just a word to
denote the absence...

56:51.200 --> 56:55.352
Of the naivety I so keenly
exhibit? Yeah, right.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.713
Back on in three, people.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.472
Since when
were you camera-shy?

57:02.200 --> 57:04.031
What happened?
You find a wrinkle?

57:04.120 --> 57:06.475
If it isn't
Bill Sandford's poodle.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.478
Let me guess,
on a tight leash,

57:08.560 --> 57:10.278
sniffing at his ass
for business?

57:10.840 --> 57:12.068
If you weren't such a joke,

57:12.160 --> 57:13.388
we'd already have
his business.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.598
So how about this?

57:15.680 --> 57:17.033
Give Mini-Me a day off,

57:17.160 --> 57:19.390
and I'll give you
a shot at the title.

57:19.480 --> 57:21.869
Live TV debate, you and me.

57:23.160 --> 57:24.195
You must be desperate

57:24.280 --> 57:25.416
if you're willing
to give me airtime.

57:25.440 --> 57:26.720
I kick your bony ass
hard enough,

57:26.760 --> 57:28.113
Bill Sandford will realize

57:28.200 --> 57:29.640
why he came to us
in the first place.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.871
Uh-uh. You need me strong
to make him worried.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.674
You're not looking so strong
after a head-on with me.

57:37.280 --> 57:39.350
All right. I'll grant you
a job interview

57:39.440 --> 57:40.793
on national television.

57:40.880 --> 57:43.474
You can show your master
what a big, tough dog you are.

57:53.320 --> 57:54.416
What we're about to discuss

57:54.440 --> 57:55.919
should only be
referred to in code

57:56.000 --> 57:57.558
in the office and over e-mail.

57:58.920 --> 58:00.911
My ex-employers aren't
beyond bugging and hacking.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.200
You think our conference room
is wearing a wire?

58:03.280 --> 58:04.880
We're gonna target
a senator from a state

58:05.040 --> 58:06.712
we have zero right to swing.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.280
Oh, please, God, don't say...

58:08.360 --> 58:10.476
Alberto Gomez,
Republican, Florida.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.109
What?

58:12.200 --> 58:13.576
I thought you were
gonna say Missouri.

58:13.600 --> 58:14.635
Florida's preposterous.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.029
I'm being optimistic.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.776
Public opinion runs against
Heaton-Harris in Florida.

58:18.800 --> 58:20.711
- Let's talk later.
- In the office?

58:21.480 --> 58:24.074
How do I register my dissent?
By semaphore?

58:24.280 --> 58:25.456
Alex, you're in charge
of ad banners,

58:25.480 --> 58:26.959
you have a 2:00 at JWT.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.758
I want two phone pitches.

58:28.840 --> 58:30.239
Clara, Brian, Lauren,
you're one.

58:30.360 --> 58:32.669
Cynthia, Esme, Franklin,
you're two.

58:32.760 --> 58:35.399
Ross, get stats to both.
Come on, get to it.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.758
What the hell
are you thinking?

58:41.840 --> 58:43.273
That you should
let me do my job.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.713
This ain't Cole Kravitz,
damn it.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.112
Our client's a non-profit,

58:47.200 --> 58:48.997
not some cashed-up
conglomerate.

58:49.640 --> 58:51.835
I'm hiding in the bushes
with my begging bowl,

58:51.920 --> 58:53.776
waiting to leap out at anyone
who looks like money,

58:53.800 --> 58:55.136
and you're getting ready
to set fire

58:55.160 --> 58:57.390
to half a million dollars
on some hare-brained...

58:59.800 --> 59:02.155
I mean this James Bond
shit's endearingly wacky,

59:02.600 --> 59:04.336
but if you think you're
seriously going to get

59:04.360 --> 59:06.191
any traction out of Florida,
you're way out.

59:06.280 --> 59:09.113
Rodolfo, it was explicit
in your pitch to lure me here

59:09.200 --> 59:10.656
that you held
a certain degree of trust

59:10.680 --> 59:12.272
in my ability
to run this campaign.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.799
George, it's me.

59:13.880 --> 59:15.154
I know what I'm doing.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.271
We need to talk about Florida.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.078
And I don't do hare-brained.

59:35.680 --> 59:37.193
Fucking A right.

59:37.480 --> 59:39.835
From the way you been
kicking my ass all morning,

59:39.920 --> 59:41.069
I'm starting to think

59:41.160 --> 59:43.310
you invited yourself here
just to kick my ass.

59:45.640 --> 59:47.995
I'm personally in favor
of Heaton-Harris.

59:48.560 --> 59:51.233
I've publicly declared,
my voters are behind me.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.956
Did you want to meet
just to kick my ass?

59:55.640 --> 59:57.756
Look,
you're sitting on six votes.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.594
Sandford's not a punk,

59:59.680 --> 1:00:01.716
he knows the opposition's
counting on them.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.198
He also knows
if they don't get them,

1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:05.793
their campaign will be over.

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:08.673
So, what are you gonna do?

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.115
Walk into my club,

1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:11.480
bend me over
a green baize table,

1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:13.551
and give me the spiel
about freedom?

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:16.016
About how,
if the liberals get their way,

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:17.200
in a couple of hundred years,

1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:18.832
the Second Amendment
will enshrine

1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:20.478
our rights to bear
baseball bats?

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:22.678
No, that's the argument
you're gonna make

1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:24.398
to your friends
in the Blue Dog Coalition

1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:26.400
when you tell them
you're changing your position.

1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:32.750
Bill Sandford's thinking about
backing a new candidate.

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:36.194
One of their own.
A real up-and-comer. Hispanic.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:39.393
Got offers from
eight Ivy League schools.

1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:41.068
Ivy League schools?

1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:43.432
Have you seen
my approval ratings, Pat?

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:45.238
No, he's not running
against you.

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:47.920
He's running against your son.

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:57.071
The gun lobby wants
your support, Hank.

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:01.416
They know your boy's
running for Michigan.

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:02.839
They'll handpick an opponent.

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:04.913
Back him to the hilt.

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:07.712
I tried to talk Sandford
out of it, but...

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:08.976
Bullshit, Connors,
you probably

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:10.360
put him up to it,
you motherfucker.

1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:11.839
About those approval ratings.

1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:15.591
You can go either way.

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:20.116
Quietly recant,
protect your son.

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:22.633
Sandford won't forget it.

1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:26.633
You disappoint him...

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:29.753
He won't forget that, either.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.759
So, how was Pittsburgh?

1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:40.033
What are you, a Fed?

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:43.268
The President of the Mid-Atlantic
Association of Women

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:45.715
in Law Enforcement called
to say thanks for lunch.

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:48.920
I wasn't aware they were
part of our plan.

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:50.915
It wasn't expensed.

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:52.274
It was a 30-minute lunch.

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:53.713
They're not
a part of our plan,

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:55.995
which is why
it wasn't expensed.

1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:57.678
Am I not allowed
a social life?

1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:58.949
I didn't know you had one.

1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:00.799
As someone who has
her underlings

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.313
root for
conversational topics.

1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:04.391
I maintain
a small circle of allies.

1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:06.198
Uh-huh. Cops and nurses?

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:09.717
Well, I can provide a list if
you require full disclosure.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:13.597
So, grand unveiling.

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:16.438
- You coming?
- We got a bigger problem.

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:18.456
While you've been jetting
around the country for lunch,

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.040
our opponents have been
doing their job.

1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:22.356
Hank Badgley,
Chairman of the Blue Dog,

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:23.879
who controls the votes of...

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.309
Six Senators, I know who
he is. He's in our pocket.

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:27.992
Really? That what you think?

1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:31.679
He was on board,
but he just did a 180.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:34.118
Says he wants to wait and see.

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:37.672
"Wait and see"
is more like a 90.

1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:39.911
We're chasing Senators
who are in play.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.195
We can't afford to lose
seven votes we had locked.

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:43.588
We won't recover.

1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:45.757
We have him on camera
pledging support?

1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:46.840
Absolutely.

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:49.078
Then we'll have to
make him feel it.

1:02:56.760 --> 1:02:58.079
Thank you.

1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:07.592
Alex, these banners are good.

1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:09.754
Could you say that again

1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:11.200
and sound a little
less surprised?

1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:13.392
Hold on, this can't be right.

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.950
- Senator Gomez...
- We're not going to Florida.

1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:18.160
What?

1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:20.549
Florida's out.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:23.056
But you said that
we were going to Florida

1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:24.080
to swing Gomez...

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:26.469
Everyone turn to Tab 9,
please.

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:33.512
I don't have
anything at Tab 9.

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:49.351
Security, lock down
Cynthia Green's desk.

1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:51.078
Secure her files
and her hard drives,

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:52.400
and escort her
off the premises.

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:54.909
Your Blackberry, now.

1:03:57.240 --> 1:03:58.639
Now!

1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:01.955
Let's go.

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:03.759
He offered me
partnership track.

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:05.399
Good luck with that.

1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:07.273
Clear the office.

1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:09.960
Come on, come on, come on!
Everybody out.

1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:16.640
I'll have the place
swept for taps.

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:19.638
Sounds like James Bond
shit to me.

1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:21.473
We will talk about this later.

1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:25.917
Come on, everybody,
clear the building!

1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:28.951
Let's go! Out! Come on!

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:41.480
I can't believe the whole

1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:43.317
Gomez-Florida thing
was a ruse.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.357
We're coming out of
left field to take Colorado

1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:48.074
before they figure out which
hole they got screwed in.

1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:49.479
How could she do that?

1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:51.912
How does someone
even think like that?

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.274
Maybe in her naivety,

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:54.920
she figured it'd be good
for her career.

1:04:57.400 --> 1:04:58.628
I wasn't talking
about Cynthia.

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:14.749
Morning.

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:19.634
Please take a seat.

1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:21.358
We're not saying
it can't be done.

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:22.920
But it's risky.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.116
- We only get one shot.
- Hey!

1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:28.555
Were you followed?

1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:29.715
Evidently.

1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:32.988
Let him in.

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:34.416
Do you solemnly swear

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:35.496
that you will tell the truth,

1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:37.317
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:39.072
upon pains and penalties
of perjury?

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:42.673
I do.

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:48.438
State your full name, please.

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.233
Well, look at this.

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:52.757
Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt.

1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:57.712
I'm guessing this gear
ain't for tuning my '69 Chevy?

1:05:58.360 --> 1:06:00.715
Rodolfo,
my unofficial support team.

1:06:01.960 --> 1:06:03.109
Big Sam.

1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:04.628
Little Sam.

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:07.753
During the time that you
worked alongside Miss Sloane,

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:09.917
did you hold any discussions

1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:11.040
pertaining to the use

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:12.917
of illegal
surveillance techniques?

1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:17.856
So, how big
is your organization?

1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:20.519
Well, there are six of us,
four are out on assignment.

1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:22.957
- And you're ex...
- NSA.

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:25.354
Badgley is flip-flopping.

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:26.998
But, quickest way
to get him in line

1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:28.354
is to mine for sordid details,

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:30.376
and then let him know
we're in possession of them.

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:33.551
Mr. Schmidt,
did you?

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:35.638
Yes, Senator, we did.

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:37.796
And what means did they have
at their disposal

1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:40.388
to carry out these
surveillance practices?

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:42.948
Standard 24-hour
video and audio surveillance,

1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:44.638
cell phone and online
account hacking,

1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:49.073
location tracking,
and, with our latest tech,

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:52.871
close-quarters audio,
anytime, anyplace.

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:56.920
You ever hear the expression
"Fly on the wall"?

1:06:57.360 --> 1:06:59.396
Well, meet the cutting edge
in eavesdropping.

1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:01.989
It's a cockroach.

1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.872
Which can be retro-fitted

1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:07.509
as a cybernetic
robo-roach with this.

1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:11.395
We glue electrodes
to its antennae,

1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:12.754
perforate the thorax,

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:14.871
and we can control
its movement remotely.

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.632
Don't call PETA, Schmidt.

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:18.233
These guys can
crawl under doors,

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:20.709
into crevices, bags,
completely undetected.

1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:23.635
They can go weeks without food
and still be mobile.

1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:27.829
And how did you react to
the possibility of all this?

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:30.872
I told her it was
mind-boggling, ingenious,

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:33.269
morally repugnant
and completely unacceptable.

1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:35.034
Boo!

1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:36.792
You're talking
about blackmailing

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:38.518
a United States Senator.

1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:42.189
Have you any idea of the
damage if this ever came out?

1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:44.601
No more than the damage done
if we don't get Badgley back.

1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:47.232
Without prejudice
to the undoubtedly

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:48.753
stellar job that you guys do.

1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:51.233
Our firm has certain standards

1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:53.072
below which I'm not
prepared to stoop.

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:56.195
Let me out of here.

1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:58.229
Schmidt.

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:00.514
Find another way.

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:08.736
It was a rude awakening

1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:10.360
for Michigan Senator,
Hank Badgley, today

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.709
as he was tailed from his home
to his workplace by this...

1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:16.559
What the fuck is that?

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:18.432
...organized by gun safety
campaigners

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:19.800
in response
to what they perceive

1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:21.040
as a U-turn on his support...

1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:24.550
Can you believe...
I do not fucking believe!

1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:29.037
...in the shadow
of a giant rat.

1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:33.239
It's on all of
the national news outlets.

1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:35.510
How the hell
did she manage that?

1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:38.160
She didn't. They swing
left all on their own.

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:39.753
It has its own Twitter feed.

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:41.200
Huh?

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:44.839
The rat.

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:47.799
Really, I think that
this whole rat business

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:50.633
is little more than an
unfortunate misunderstanding.

1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:53.076
I was one of the first
members of the senate

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:55.395
to lend my support
to Heaton-Harris.

1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:56.799
I've always maintained that

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.438
the Bill is integral
to public safety,

1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:01.074
and my support for it
is unwavering.

1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:03.117
Now, I sincerely hope that

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:04.878
we can get past
all this silliness...

1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:06.296
Th ree more
Blue Dog Senators

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:08.470
have press conferences
scheduled for next week.

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:09.856
Keep hammering the point

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.871
that we're not arguing
for confiscation.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.353
Heaton-Harris
is about stopping...

1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:14.839
Criminals and psychopaths.

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:16.359
Yeah, I'm a pro
at this now, Liz.

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.237
I'll see you in there.

1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:21.150
So you knew there was
a leak from when?

1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:22.434
- Sorry?
- Cynthia.

1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:24.835
When did you start to
suspect there was a leak?

1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:26.717
Uh, after the UAPD fundraiser.

1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:28.552
And you had her
followed by a PI?

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:30.278
How did you know it was her?

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:31.719
Sorry?

1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:33.836
The leak, you had
Cynthia watched.

1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:35.599
How did you know it was her?

1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:37.838
I didn't.

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:40.753
You had us all watched?

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.079
Howdy.

1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:46.435
Cal Sneider,
banking and actuarial.

1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:49.096
I'm sure we've
been introduced,

1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:50.120
but your name escapes me.

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.760
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong person.

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.149
I'm pretty sure I don't.

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:54.793
Have a good memory for faces.

1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:56.640
This one I wouldn't
readily forget.

1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.112
Really, Mr. Sneider,

1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:01.317
I've no idea
who you think I am.

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:02.839
Excuse me.

1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.038
Uh-huh. You know
we're not really

1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:14.616
supposed to be having
this conversation, right?

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:16.616
Half of Oregon
is protected Federal parkland.

1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:18.039
They can't develop it.

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:19.856
So, state budgets
come from logging revenues.

1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:20.920
- I got it...
- Liz?

1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:23.080
Whatever clearing your head
looks like, this isn't it.

1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.277
So, loggers are
a very influential group.

1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:26.635
Excuse me!

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:28.520
Can someone have her
makeup done, too, please?

1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:29.629
I'm not a part of this!

1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.256
You're a public figure
in a room full of cameras.

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:32.395
Is that her?

1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:35.280
Liz?

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:37.950
Hey, we have to get
Bryan on these loggers.

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:39.256
We're on top of
the goddamn loggers!

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:40.280
Just clear your head!

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:41.320
One moment.

1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:42.993
Clear your head,
like I told you.

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:44.389
Hello?

1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:49.389
- Fine.
- Ms. Sloane, welcome.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.230
Pat. Please, take a seat.

1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:54.114
I know Friday's Filing Day

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:55.336
and your campaign
will be over,

1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:56.496
but if you're thinking
I'm gonna go easy,

1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:57.520
I can't do that.

1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:00.593
This is live TV,
so no colorful language.

1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:02.511
Bullshit
job offers to my staff,

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.079
you've plumbed new depths.

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:05.798
A giant inflatable rodent?
Please.

1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.080
You ruined that girl's career.

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:10.510
All right, shut up,
the both of you. Let's go!

1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:17.836
Hello, America,
I'm Jon O'Neill,

1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:20.872
welcome to a special edition
ofThis Week In Washington.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:23.828
Guns! More or Less?

1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:26.798
There were 372
mass shootings last year,

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:28.393
64 school shootings,

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:31.398
and there are over 300
million guns in our country...

1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:33.160
You used to
work with Connors?

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:34.434
Four years.

1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:39.270
Foul-mouthed, unexpected,
and very effective.

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:42.994
If background checks
are to be of any use,

1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:45.753
they should apply to
all gun sales, not just some.

1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:48.075
Isn't that what Heaton-Harris
is proposing?

1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:51.835
Precisely. The bill expands
the scope of gun regulation,

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:53.239
and it's yet another affront

1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:55.072
to Americans'
Constitutional rights.

1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:57.549
No, the bill closes
an absurd loophole

1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:00.029
which allows people
on terrorist watch-lists

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.315
to buy guns without
any checks whatsoever.

1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:04.356
It's an incursion
into individual liberty

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:05.998
by an all-powerful
government...

1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:08.548
- What, like drivers' licenses?
- Drivers' licenses?

1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:10.273
It's illegal to operate a car

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:11.456
without going through rigorous

1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:13.118
theoretical and practical
assessments.

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:15.470
- That's a clear constraint...
- Fugu chefs.

1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:17.480
...on the freedom of
individuals to drive cars,

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:20.034
- or pilots to fly planes.
- Come on. Fugu chefs.

1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.918
You know, in Japan,
chefs train for seven years

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.274
before they're
allowed to serve

1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:25.720
a poisonous blowfish
called fugu.

1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:26.795
Yes!

1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:27.976
What does any of this

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.320
have to do with
background checks?

1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:30.919
Is a fair question.

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.194
Does anyone in this room

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.400
think the government should
abolish drivers' licenses?

1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:35.954
- That's absurd.
- Why?

1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:38.280
They're a government incursion
into individual liberty.

1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:40.796
We accept them because
they make sense.

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:42.518
The more dangerous
the machinery,

1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.318
the more rigorous
the tests should be.

1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:46.192
I think we can
extend our definition

1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:48.999
of dangerous machinery
to semi-automatic firearms.

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.016
Except that the Second
Amendment to the Constitution

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:53.429
doesn't guarantee
the right to drive cars,

1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:57.115
or operate machinery or serve
blowfish for that matter.

1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.272
It guarantees the right
to keep and bear arms.

1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:02.438
Perhaps you haven't
read it lately.

1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:03.953
Nothing in the bill

1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:06.918
infringes the rights of the
people to keep and bear arms.

1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.496
The Second Amendment
was signed in a time

1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:10.397
where the average
life expectancy was 38,

1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.040
and it was common practice
for our Founding Fathers

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:16.590
to resolve their differences
at dawn in a gunfight.

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:19.638
What may have been perfectly
sensible in those alien times

1:13:20.040 --> 1:13:22.296
is wholly inadequate to solve
the problems of the present.

1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:24.197
That's not the rebuttal,
what's she doing?

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:25.696
The United States
Constitution

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:27.278
has stood the test of time.

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:31.035
It's authored to confer
unimpeachable rights,

1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:32.354
which don't change depending

1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:34.432
on which way
the wind's blowing.

1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:36.398
It's so authored
with the specific intent

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:37.674
of keeping at bay

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:39.478
the Elizabeth Sloanes
of this world,

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:41.496
who wanna wipe their asses
with the Constitution...

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:42.669
Okay, let's...

1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:44.400
...and replace it
with their own judgment,

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:45.873
because she knows better than

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.672
the Founding Fathers
of this great nation.

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.788
Nothing is unimpeachable,
not even the Constitution.

1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:54.075
It's ironic that the very
statement of rights

1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:55.679
you're so quick to invoke

1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:57.671
is in fact an Amendment.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.640
I may not
like it either, Elizabeth,

1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:01.679
but it's the Second Amendment.

1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:05.196
Comes right after freedom of
speech, religion, and press,

1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:07.157
and somewhere before
freedom from search

1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.240
and from having to testify
against yourself.

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:10.880
They're all sort of
bunched together.

1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:12.400
It's called
the Bill of Rights.

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.720
- How do you get around that?
- We don't need to.

1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:16.473
Supreme Court
already made it clear

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:18.118
that the right to own a gun

1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:19.838
is subject to
lawful restriction.

1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:21.478
One of those
is background checks.

1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.717
Universal background checks
are an infringement.

1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:27.277
What part of
"shall not be infringed"

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:28.594
don't you get?

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.632
I get that that's the weakest,
most mind-numbing retort

1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:33.717
in your impoverished arsenal.

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:35.393
Sort of a last refuge
for those

1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:36.640
with no real argument at all.

1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:37.789
You're talking about

1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:39.080
the United States
Constitution.

1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:41.675
If they could produce
a rational winning argument,

1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:43.796
I'd gladly migrate
to their side,

1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:46.758
but "because it says so
in the Constitution,

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:50.953
"the Bible, or my horoscope,"
it's not a winning argument!

1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:52.115
It's a ripcord.

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:54.435
An intellectual equivalent
of a yellow,

1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:57.472
pant-pissing wimp
cowering behind mommy's skirt.

1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:00.074
- Why don't we bring this back.
- No, no, no. Let's not!

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.037
Why don't we ask
all the mothers out there

1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:04.839
who lost their children
to an armed sociopath,

1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:07.229
if they believe
in his unimpeachable

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:09.675
Constitutional right
to bear arms?

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:11.398
Why not ask the terrified girl

1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:13.516
who locked herself
in a janitor's closet

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:14.794
at Bloomington High,

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.069
forced to listen

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:18.355
as her peers were
being massacred?

1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:20.598
Go ahead, ask her!

1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:22.955
Her name is Esme Manucharian.

1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:26.520
She's standing right there!

1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:34.032
Jesus Christ, Liz.

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:36.553
Okay, time out!

1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:38.640
We're going to take a break,
and when we come back,

1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:41.158
maybe these two
will stop playing

1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:43.874
Patty Cake and
the gloves'll really come off.

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.552
Be right back!

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:10.752
I won't insult
your intelligence

1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:12.880
by claiming that came out
in the heat of the moment.

1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:19.193
How far back?

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.390
Once I started getting
used to all the media?

1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.635
Okay. Day one.

1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:31.595
Wow.

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.638
At dinner that night...

1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:42.638
You asked me if I'd go public

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:45.188
if it was the difference
between victory and defeat.

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:50.239
What if I'd said no?

1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:53.633
Would you still have done it?

1:16:54.520 --> 1:16:55.873
Probably.

1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:58.473
I was hired to win,

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:00.393
and I have a responsibility

1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:02.158
to use whatever
resource I have.

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:04.480
The press we're going to
get from this,

1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:06.496
it's practically a dereliction
of duty not to use it.

1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:08.272
That's it? I'm a "resource"?

1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:09.713
Professionally, yes.

1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:15.158
I understand you have
feelings, and a life,

1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:16.878
but I have no duty to them.

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:20.509
I have a duty to the cause,
and if the two conflict,

1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.034
there will only
ever be one winner.

1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:28.072
Well, hooray for
straight talk.

1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:31.593
Okay.

1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:34.792
Get ready, Esme.
Network wants a statement.

1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:38.071
Re-apply your makeup.
We'll walk out arm-in-arm.

1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:39.991
We'll be brief. No questions.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:43.638
Tonight, we'll leave them
wanting more.

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:50.753
First of all,

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:52.920
I want to make it clear
that I have dedicated my life

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:56.748
to gun safety issues because
the current system is broken.

1:17:57.160 --> 1:17:58.513
That's a rational judgment.

1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:00.239
Not an emotional one.

1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:06.319
I am a survivor

1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:10.432
of the Bloomington High School
massacre of 1998.

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:15.237
For years, I sought to hide
the pain and the trauma,

1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:16.594
for fear of having to
relive it.

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:19.273
But I've come to realize

1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:23.431
that the thousands of people
affected by gun violence

1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:25.954
need to stand up
and be counted.

1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:28.953
They need a representative

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:31.995
who can speak out
for what they have endured.

1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:33.868
Let's call Sandford.

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:35.816
Someone who can relate
their experience...

1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:37.159
There might be
life in this yet.

1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:38.554
...to the public at large.

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:15.798
You're a piece of work,
Elizabeth.

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:23.398
If you want to
set yourself on fire

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:27.515
to service your need to win,
I won't protest, but Esme?

1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:30.440
The end is my concern.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:32.954
You liberal goody-goodies
can fret over the means.

1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:34.513
- You need me.
- The end?

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:36.074
It disappeared over the Hill

1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:38.176
when you cocked your leg
and pissed all over the flag!

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:41.158
Comparing the United States
Constitution to a horoscope?

1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:44.270
That's the kind of shit
the gun lobby thrives on.

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:47.336
Or have you realized by now
we're going to lose anyway?

1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:49.430
This is more important
than my career,

1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:51.351
or Esme's unease
at fighting reporters

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:53.040
every time she has to
take out the trash.

1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:55.355
- You're out of control.
- We're not gonna lose.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:19:59.308
What if I told you

1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:03.392
this whole strategy
was a shell game?

1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:08.228
For the benefit of the
Cynthia Greens of this firm.

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:11.148
What are you talking about?

1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:13.799
Bill Sandford was right.

1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:17.872
Women are the
gun lobby's blind spot.

1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:22.598
A massive power base
that they don't speak to

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:24.673
and they can't control.

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:26.560
And?

1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:30.271
Those strange excursions
on my itinerary?

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:35.630
Women's representative bodies,
feminist groups,

1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:37.793
female CEOs.

1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:40.319
I've talked as many as I could

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:42.118
into brow-beating
their membership

1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:43.514
to donate to my PAC.

1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:44.600
You have a PAC?

1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.078
Bill Sandford's getting
a nasty surprise

1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:49.589
come filing day.

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:51.429
How nasty are we talking?

1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:54.718
Fifteen million from over
three million donors-nasty.

1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:57.588
In one quarter?

1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:02.997
Actually, less.

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:06.677
Unbelievable.

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:11.080
Why are you
telling me this now?

1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:13.696
You kept this
from me all along,

1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:14.920
and you're telling me tonight?

1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:16.837
Oh, my God, I tell you
we're back in the game,

1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.109
and all you can say is that?

1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:19.997
You knew you were
gonna screw Esme tonight,

1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:21.656
so you kept this from me
to blindside me

1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:23.000
before I had a chance
to fire you.

1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:26.115
You have unusual insight
for a "boutique" lobbyist.

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:28.640
You've been pulling
all the strings, all along.

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:31.719
Lobbying is about foresight.

1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:34.075
You anticipate your opponent's
moves, you devise...

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.954
I am not your
fucking opponent!

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:42.714
Were you ever normal?

1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:45.635
As a child?

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:49.268
Or were the twisted
thought processes in your mind

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:50.475
hard-wired in the womb?

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.558
Because I'm having
a really hard time

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:55.357
understanding how
somebody gets to this.

1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:01.833
Guess I'm just
a piece of work.

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.399
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:42.712
You're Madeline
Elizabeth Sloane.

1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:45.915
You work in government affairs
at a communications company.

1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:47.713
Well googled.

1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:50.876
So what was that?
At the fundraiser?

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:53.240
You pretended
like we're strangers.

1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:54.919
What did you expect?

1:22:56.840 --> 1:22:58.034
You all right?

1:22:58.600 --> 1:22:59.600
Mmm...

1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:04.310
The only person to call me
Madeline was my mother.

1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:08.835
Government affairs
and communications

1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:10.757
are just fancy words
for lobbying.

1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:13.550
And lobbying's a fancy word
for what, exactly?

1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:15.272
Outside this room,
we're strangers.

1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:18.000
Those were the rules
of this engagement.

1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:19.109
We were alone...

1:23:19.240 --> 1:23:21.151
In a public place.

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:23.392
I can't be associated
with you there.

1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:25.917
At least one other person
knew who you were.

1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:28.069
Who was she, anyway?

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:30.518
I never reveal
my clients. Ever.

1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.750
You just, uh, pry into
their personal lives,

1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:34.074
google for the truth.

1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:36.376
Yeah, I hear you lobbyists
ain't so good with the truth.

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:37.753
Says the guy
with four identities,

1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:39.280
who sleeps with
strangers for money?

1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:41.560
I'm just surprised by what
a natural bullshitter you are.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:43.511
I grew up lying, Forde.

1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:45.272
Didn't want to. I had to.

1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:47.279
That's why I excel at it.

1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:50.158
It's a skill I would've
happily traded

1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:51.280
for a normal life.

1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:55.079
Normal's overrated.

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:38.480
I'm sorry.

1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:40.435
I'm sorry.

1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:44.679
But I can't.

1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:46.834
What's wrong?

1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:54.632
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about tonight.

1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:57.238
Why? I do somethin'?

1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:59.032
No, it's, um...

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:02.511
I'm not in
the right frame of mind.

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:05.514
Here.

1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:08.834
- Easiest money you ever made.
- I didn't do anything.

1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:12.592
Well, you showed up,
I wasted your time, so, yeah.

1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:14.880
You know, we could just
sit and talk, and...

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.480
Take the fucking money,
Forde!

1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:24.194
Get out, please.

1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:32.079
Suit yourself.

1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:49.754
Neumark.

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:51.758
- Milner.
- Two hands here, come on.

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.950
- Carlson...
- Wade Powell, Virginia.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.080
Hackman's come over too.

1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:57.270
We've lost Milner, Neumark,
Carlson, Hackman.

1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:59.256
Adamou's chief of staff said
he's softening his position.

1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:00.952
- Alex?
- I'll soften his fuckin'...

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:02.433
Bill Sandford's on line 3.

1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:03.993
Closing Adamou
right the fuck now.

1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:07.715
She takes my own idea

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:09.000
and goes up
against us with it.

1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:10.520
We did try
to warn you, Bill.

1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:13.474
Fifteen million.
From three million donors.

1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:14.749
In less than a quarter.

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:17.110
You stop her,
you stop Heaton-Harris.

1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:18.593
We have to
make it personal now.

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:19.835
She becomes the story.

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:22.116
We can use our
media relationships, Bill,

1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:23.429
put her on the defensive.

1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:25.198
I don't just want her
on the defensive.

1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:27.675
I don't just want her
off the campaign.

1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:30.793
I want her to be the reason
that people think twice

1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:33.480
before taking on the guardians
of the Second Amendment.

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:36.071
I want her career.

1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:40.437
Hey, Alex, it's me.
I just landed.

1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:43.400
Philadelphia was as good as
what we could have hoped for.

1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:45.710
- So how are we doing?
- That's four to go, people.

1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:48.839
You're kidding me.

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:52.712
Wow, that's amazing.

1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:53.856
All right.

1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:55.320
We're joined now
by Esme Manucharian.

1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:57.079
Esme, thanks for joining us.

1:26:57.160 --> 1:26:58.957
Would you say that
the gun debate is now

1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:00.320
largely become
a women's issue?

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.998
You need only
look at the numbers

1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:03.758
to see that gun safety
has become

1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:05.432
a deciding issue
for American women.

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:08.032
If their representative
isn't listening,

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.160
they'll go to the polls
and elect someone who will.

1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:22.114
What do you want?

1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:24.068
I got 15 million to blow.

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:27.158
Lauren was going
through your letters.

1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:30.154
Between the death threats and
the hate mail, she found this.

1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:33.113
Pru Walsh
of The Sentinel is doing

1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:34.456
a feature on
the lobbying industry.

1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:35.549
That means you.

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:37.920
Well, if she wants to meet me,
why did she send a letter?

1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:39.656
Because she doesn't really
want to meet you.

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:40.976
She wants to say
she reached out to you

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.520
for an interview,
but didn't hear back.

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.000
It's a takedown.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.840
Well, the least we can do
is disappoint her.

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:48.360
Set it up.

1:27:49.400 --> 1:27:50.799
I've canceled your 10:00 a.m.

1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:52.400
You're gonna see
our in-house attorney.

1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:54.480
I don't believe
you two have met.

1:27:56.400 --> 1:27:57.628
You know how
I feel about this.

1:27:57.720 --> 1:27:59.040
I was against you
ever hiring her.

1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:01.550
Because your job is not
winning lobbying fights,

1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.598
your job is
to stop us from getting...

1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:08.960
Quite independently of her
being utterly contemptible.

1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:10.793
What the hell
were you thinking?

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.233
You know, whatever it was,

1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.157
I guess it seems
pretty stupid now.

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:17.156
Liz, meet your protection.

1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:30.238
Daniel Posner, Head of Legal.

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:32.271
Liz Sloane,
contemptible liability.

1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:33.554
And amateur lip-reader.

1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:37.111
Whose idea were
the glass walls? Seriously?

1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:40.557
Two TV slots tomorrow,

1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:44.076
then a radio thing, and
finally I'm done in Illinois.

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:45.879
Where are you?

1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:47.336
Gold Stone,
waiting for them to hurry up

1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:48.429
and invent the food pill.

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.478
That may take a while.

1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:53.320
And plotting to ensnare
our last four senators.

1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:56.074
Fifty-six down, four to go.
We're actually doing... Oh!

1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:58.830
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry. My fault.

1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:04.272
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Here you go.

1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:06.040
Okay.

1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:09.714
Sorry about that.

1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:11.916
Remember that first day when
I asked how do we win,

1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:13.758
and you said
"Realistically, we don't"?

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.437
I stand by every word of that.

1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:17.829
Excuse me?

1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:19.896
So you're going to downplay
the 15 million?

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:21.056
Yeah, 'cause
we can't sound like

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.275
we're bragging about
how much we're pulling in.

1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:27.160
Senators link donations
to voting intention,

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:28.872
we can't say anything
that might stop...

1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:30.313
You wanna take this, bitch?

1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:32.960
Huh?

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:35.720
Esme, you're still there?

1:29:35.840 --> 1:29:37.034
Come on.

1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:40.069
Take it.

1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:45.480
Esme? What the hell was that?

1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:47.269
You been here before, right?

1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:49.080
Esme?

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:50.714
Look at me!

1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:52.589
Esme?

1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:54.640
Except I'm gonna
do it right this time.

1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:17.976
I'm standing at the scene

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:19.228
of last night's shooting.

1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:20.799
We understand
that the assailant

1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:23.953
was targeting a leading figure
in the gun control movement,

1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:26.349
and was then shot dead
by a civilian

1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:28.994
carrying a registered,
concealed firearm.

1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:32.399
The name of the vigilante
has yet to be revealed...

1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:35.875
George?

1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:37.519
You're watching the news?

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:39.672
Yeah, whole bunch of
Christmases

1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:41.233
just came early
for Bill Sandford.

1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.157
I'm headed to the airport.
Get ready to spend some money.

1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:48.360
Police have confirmed his
identity as Frank McGill.

1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:52.510
McGill was a legal owner
of a registered weapon.

1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:54.876
Heaton-Harris wouldn't have
touched him.

1:30:55.480 --> 1:30:56.913
But it might
have made it harder

1:30:57.040 --> 1:30:58.359
for the other son of a bitch.

1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:01.438
What do we know about him?
Where'd he get his piece?

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:03.596
Did he have an arsenal
stashed in his basement...

1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:05.869
For the Second Amendment,

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.195
which guaranteed her right
to be protected

1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:09.673
from a sick individual.

1:31:09.760 --> 1:31:11.990
And most of all,
for Frank McGill.

1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:15.311
Model citizen,
vigilant, responsible,

1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:16.913
and his aim is true.

1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:47.913
How are you doing?

1:31:58.040 --> 1:31:59.268
You heading home?

1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:03.793
You make a round-trip
from D.C.

1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:05.273
to pin me
in a departure lounge?

1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:08.638
So you can
check me off your list?

1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:14.589
I betrayed your confidence.
I set you down this path.

1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:17.680
"Don't worry, Liz,
it's not your fault."

1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:19.113
Is that what you wanna hear?

1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:21.878
"How could you
possibly have known?"

1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:24.999
You're not gonna get it.

1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:28.279
He wanted to kill me.

1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:38.835
I didn't know
where the line was, Esme.

1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:47.958
I never, never know
where the line is.

1:32:57.320 --> 1:32:58.800
Obviously,
take all the time you want.

1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:00.195
And when you're ready,

1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:02.000
we'd love to have you
back on the campaign.

1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.108
Your own terms.

1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:05.800
No media, you can work
behind the scenes.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:10.479
If you don't want
to work with me,

1:33:12.680 --> 1:33:14.079
I'll resign from the campaign.

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:17.993
If that's what you want.

1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:20.836
Is that your move
to get me back at my desk?

1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:23.759
You want me
in front of a camera

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:25.159
to counter Frank McGill?

1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:34.355
It even crossed my mind
that this was all you.

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.228
You just didn't account

1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:38.840
for an armed civilian
right behind me.

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:41.200
Esme...

1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:42.753
I'll keep fighting, Elizabeth.

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:45.353
Wherever I can
make a difference.

1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:50.232
But as far as possible
away from you.

1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:56.078
You crossed the line
when you stopped

1:33:56.200 --> 1:33:57.394
treating people with respect.

1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:00.160
You're smart enough
to know that.

1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:03.029
You just don't care.

1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.880
Thank you,
thank you. Welcome back.

1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:12.399
Our next guest this morning is

1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:13.696
the kind of guy
you'd want to have around

1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:15.551
when you're walking home
from work one night

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:17.671
and some dude sticks
a gun in your face.

1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:19.016
After his military career,

1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:20.632
McGill worked
as a commercial pilot...

1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:22.576
Let's face it,
folks, the streets ain 't safe.

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.318
And if it wasn't for
the courage, bravery,

1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:26.470
and damn fine aim
of our next guest,

1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:30.075
we'd be reflecting
on yet another tragedy.

1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:32.237
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:34.954
the man of the moment,
Frank McGill.

1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:41.670
So, Frank McGill,
all-American hero.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:43.512
Not at all.
An ordinary guy

1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:45.113
in the right place
at the right time.

1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:47.120
With
a 9 milli. under his belt.

1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:51.353
I'm curious. The person whose
life you saved once campaigned

1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:53.670
for a ban on concealed carry.

1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:55.273
How do you feel about that?

1:34:55.400 --> 1:34:57.436
I respectfully disagree
with those views.

1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:59.320
But the young lady is
entitled to her opinion

1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:01.360
and nobody should be
attacking her for that,

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:03.153
much less holding her
at gunpoint.

1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:05.792
McGill's a gift from God.

1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:08.953
But it won't last forever.

1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:11.518
We're looking to parlay that

1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:13.278
into a closer examination
of Sloane.

1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:15.476
I'm thinking of
a Congressional hearing

1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:19.070
into her unorthodox
lobbying practices.

1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:23.955
I'm sure we can find a senator
who may be open to the idea.

1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:26.056
You want to talk trash
about her in the press,

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:27.080
that's one thing.

1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:28.872
A Congressional hearing
requires

1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:31.599
a convincing allegation
of impropriety.

1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:34.194
I'd give my left nut to drag
her rep through the dirt,

1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:35.594
but you're not gonna get it.

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:37.557
She's a CYA specialist.

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:40.989
I've never met
anyone so pedantic...

1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:42.473
Start an inquisition.

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.594
Let's see how well-covered
her ass really is.

1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:50.675
Hi.

1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:54.031
Pru Walsh. Thanks so much
for coming over.

1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:56.080
This is Mike Gordon
from our legal department.

1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:57.714
Daniel Posner from ours.

1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:00.110
Miss Sloane,
you're at the forefront

1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:02.395
of an industry
with a terrible reputation.

1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:03.840
Do you think that's deserved?

1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:07.336
The only reason this bill
wasn't passed decades ago

1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:09.120
is because of the power
of special interests.

1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:10.673
When a lobbyist
raises finance...

1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:12.536
We haven't heard
from Esme Manucharian

1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:14.915
since the attack.
Are you in contact with her?

1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:17.439
That's a private matter.

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:19.136
I think what's important
to remember...

1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:20.639
So have you
talked to her at all?

1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:23.355
What is important to remember
here is that Frank McGill

1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:25.278
is exactly
the kind of law-abiding,

1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:27.079
responsible gun owner

1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:29.191
whose rights the
Heaton-Harris Bill protects.

1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:30.960
Do you feel any guilt
about what happened?

1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:32.514
Why would I feel guilt?

1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:34.916
You made Esme the face
of your campaign.

1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:36.599
You thrust her
into the limelight

1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:37.795
that night on the debate.

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.536
- I'm not talking about this.
- You don't have to.

1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:40.576
Did she know
that you were going to

1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:42.556
out her on national TV?
Did she agree to that?

1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:45.229
Why not report that
the majority of gun owners

1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:47.118
favor more extensive
background checks?

1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:48.536
She probably went
her entire career

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:49.736
trying to keep that
a carefully guarded secret.

1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:50.936
That the gun lobby's
fear-mongering rhetoric

1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:53.200
is trying to paint Heaton-Harris
into something it's not.

1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:55.280
Do you think
that your little revelation

1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:57.272
is what made her a target?

1:36:57.400 --> 1:36:58.435
It's clear Miss Sloane

1:36:58.560 --> 1:36:59.696
doesn't wish to discuss
Ms. Manucharian.

1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:00.800
What's really clear is that

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:02.080
your article's
already written.

1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:03.376
Don't respond to that.

1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:04.920
That's purely speculative
on your part.

1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:06.957
- Who's controlling you?
- Let's not do this.

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:08.840
Look, the fact is,
you have no way of knowing

1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:10.120
what Ms. Walsh
intends to do...

1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:11.536
The fact is that
you have no interest

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:12.834
in what Miss Sloane
has to say.

1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:15.360
- And how would you know that?
- Your Dictaphone's off.

1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:22.079
Takedown.

1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:23.800
It could've been worse.

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:25.990
I've got four
factual errors so far.

1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:27.788
This is not good, Liz.

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.399
Dump it in the recycling.

1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:30.680
They'll make
pencils out of it.

1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:32.480
Maybe one will
find its way into

1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:34.272
the hands of a reporter
with some integrity.

1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:35.749
It will go away.

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:39.474
Okay, thank you.

1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:42.120
Bye.

1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:47.509
Funny how all these senators
are suddenly very busy.

1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:51.438
We all know why that is.

1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:57.073
Okay, so it's not great.

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.071
The 15 million
helped us get this far,

1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:01.920
but it doesn't last long
when you're fighting

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.228
the richest group on the Hill.

1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:04.589
Let's get to the point.

1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:06.136
How does it shake out
when it comes to the vote?

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:08.993
We'd run them close.
But by latest projections,

1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:11.790
we'll be between four
to seven votes short.

1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:14.880
There's nothing more
we can do tonight.

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:17.388
Liz, we don't have to leave.

1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:19.153
The West Coast is still awake.

1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:20.616
We can
connect with Oregon.

1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:21.993
If we close those
goddamn loggers,

1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:23.496
we could get it
to five votes tonight.

1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:25.511
Go home
and get some rest, guys.

1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:26.800
You've done enough for today.

1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:29.136
I'll take to the streets
and rip down those

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.720
fucking Frank McGill posters
one at a time if I have to.

1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:33.991
Go home,
sharpen your knives.

1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:35.759
It'll still be on tomorrow.

1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:10.639
So we keep on fighting.

1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:12.873
That's all we can do.

1:39:13.680 --> 1:39:15.159
As my ex-wife used to say.

1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:21.480
I met you running
from a fundraiser.

1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:24.440
You could be done
with all this.

1:39:25.920 --> 1:39:27.194
Why don't you quit?

1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:33.193
And do what?

1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:49.519
Good night.

1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:26.269
Hello?

1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:29.353
I'm surprised you picked up.

1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:33.473
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.

1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:52.760
She'd ply Congressmen
with benefits,

1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:56.676
free meals, tickets to events,
golfing weekends.

1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:59.194
All paid for by our clients,
via the firm.

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:00.759
Well, that right there's
enough.

1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:02.592
She'd make a point
of invoicing them,

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:04.517
though they were never
expected to pay.

1:42:05.040 --> 1:42:06.896
The debt shows as an asset
on our balance sheet.

1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:08.797
We can call it in
any time we want.

1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:10.916
You were her
right hand for two years.

1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:15.030
There's got to be something.

1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:18.953
Why's nobody
on her files?

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:21.376
There were a ton of us,
but the others got pulled out.

1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:23.136
It's not like we're in danger
of finding anything.

1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:24.354
Well, how far d'you get?

1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:25.998
We worked backwards
from her last deal

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:27.229
before she jumped ship.

1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:28.536
They said it'd
be better if we can

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:29.720
nail her on something recent.

1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:31.955
- Which was?
- Shmallow Cakes.

1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:33.115
Some tax thing.

1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:35.111
She left halfway through.

1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:36.792
I thought it was
the palm oil thing.

1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:37.955
Palm oil?

1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:39.268
Nutella Tax.

1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:41.829
Hold on.

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:44.838
The Indonesians?

1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:46.400
I don't
remember seeing that.

1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:55.394
What are you looking for?

1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:00.428
Mr. Dupont,

1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:02.758
she's in breach of
Senate Ethics rules.

1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:04.549
We can prove it.

1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:27.119
Things not looking so good
for you this cycle, Ron.

1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:32.438
You ask me, you're gonna need
a lot more paid media.

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:34.040
I didn't ask you.

1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:38.949
Now, who might just be able to
fund those coveted TV spots?

1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:41.038
I'm committed
to Heaton-Harris,

1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:42.998
I can't vote for it
with one hand

1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:44.879
and choke it with the other.

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:46.951
Under cover of impartiality,
sure you can.

1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:50.512
You've been a vocal critic
of lobbyists in the past.

1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:53.553
You'll lead an inquiry
into Sloane's affairs

1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:55.915
in response to
growing media pressure

1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:58.310
regarding her
litany of misdeeds.

1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:03.311
The cost of hearings
is paid from the public purse.

1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:06.389
Ron, our clients
have identified you

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:08.596
as the man to pull this off.

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:09.755
If you decline,

1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:11.273
I can't stop them from

1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:13.715
blitzing you
with negative finance.

1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:17.631
They won't stop
until they annihilate you.

1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:21.600
You know the root
of the word "annihilate"?

1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:23.795
It's Latin.

1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:27.470
It means, "reduce to nothing."

1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:31.470
That's what they're
going to do to you, Ron.

1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:34.632
So, what? I'll be taking
a wedge from Bill Sandford

1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:36.748
and leading the attack

1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:39.070
on Heaton-Harris'
most visible advocate?

1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:41.276
A 6th grader could
connect the dots.

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:44.909
We can create a structure
to obfuscate the source.

1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:46.958
Your big wedge will arrive

1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:50.077
courtesy of eight to 12 smaller entities

1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:52.116
with no affiliation to guns.

1:44:55.600 --> 1:44:56.999
How big a wedge we talking?

1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:01.233
Big enough

1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:03.593
to be the difference between

1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:05.398
the continuation
of your duties

1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:07.152
as a United States Senator

1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:10.354
and the reduction
of your career to nothing.

1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:27.474
This is every hit since

1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:29.915
the original Pru Walsh
hack-job two weeks ago.

1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:32.279
My personal favorite
is the one

1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:33.429
about how you toppled

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:34.896
the head of the High School
Student Council

1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:36.831
with a fabricated
plagiarism scandal.

1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:39.278
I'm assuming
that's not libelous

1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:40.793
'cause I can totally see it.

1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:42.718
That witch was insufferable.

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:45.360
I'm taking you
off the campaign.

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:46.600
What?

1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:49.033
Not you, her.

1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:51.235
I'll be outside.

1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:54.193
What are you talking about?

1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:55.474
Heaton-Harris gets colder

1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:56.960
every day you're
associated with it.

1:45:57.960 --> 1:45:59.200
Sperling's got
the hots for you.

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:01.478
I haven't even met him,
this is a setup.

1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:03.319
If they're orchestrating it,

1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:05.080
it's because they want me
off the campaign.

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:09.040
Right now, you're lawyering up
for a hearing.

1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:15.136
Regarding your representation

1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:16.354
of the Indonesian government.

1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:17.714
Dan, are you busy?

1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:19.000
Senator Allen Jacobs,

1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:22.636
the sponsor of the bill
you dubbed the Nutella Tax,

1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:26.990
was flown to Indonesia
first-class with his family,

1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:29.430
and put up at a 5-star hotel.

1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:34.119
Our audit puts the cost
of this trip at over $30,000.

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:36.152
Shortly after his return,

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:38.913
the bill was pulled
from consideration.

1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:42.796
Now, why do you suppose
this happened?

1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:45.678
I understand the trip was
for educational purposes.

1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:48.354
I can surmise that
he learned how his bill

1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:49.953
would have strangled
a key industry,

1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:51.553
and confined thousands

1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:54.279
of impoverished farmers
to destitution.

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:56.078
From his private beach?

1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:00.470
No. The truth is,
your client funded this trip

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:03.797
as an inducement for the
senator to withdraw his bill.

1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:05.513
- Isn't that right?
- Not at all.

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:07.318
My client was
the Indonesian Government.

1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:08.634
The trip was sponsored

1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:10.392
by the Institute of
Environmental Studies,

1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:13.552
a 501 C-3
non-profit organization.

1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:14.755
Travel was pre-approved

1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:16.671
by the Senate Ethics
Committee.

1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:19.558
Has your client ever
donated to this non-profit?

1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:21.228
I wouldn't know that.

1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:22.958
I'm not privy
to their list of donors.

1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:26.072
Nor had I any role
in arranging funding for this.

1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:28.313
- No role?
- Mmm.

1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:31.349
Of course,
you couldn't have any role

1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:34.912
because the Senate Ethics
rules prevent lobbyists

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:38.073
from arranging overseas travel
for members of Congress.

1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:39.388
Indeed.

1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:44.268
Do you know what this is?

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:47.600
Perhaps we can get you a copy.

1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:56.879
Are you familiar
with that form?

1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:00.197
Yes. It's a Private Sponsor
Certification Form.

1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:01.918
It's a copy of the same

1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:03.718
Private Sponsor
Certification Form

1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:06.075
that was submitted
to the Senate Ethics Committee

1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:08.879
to pre-authorize
Senator Jacobs' travel

1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:10.149
to Indonesia.

1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:13.274
Look at the handwriting
on that form, Miss Sloane.

1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:16.878
Do you recognize
that handwriting?

1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:18.755
Yes, I do.

1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:20.120
Is it your handwriting?

1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:24.269
It is.

1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:28.078
Well, it seems
we have a problem.

1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:30.956
Even though
the form was signed

1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:32.189
and filed by the non-profit,

1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:33.998
you were the one
who filled it out.

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:36.198
This is prima facie evidence

1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:38.311
that you were involved
in arranging

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:40.391
overseas travel for
a member of Congress.

1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:44.994
Constituting a clear breach
of Senate Ethics rules.

1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:46.639
Is that your trump card?

1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:49.474
You drag me in here,

1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:51.710
wedge an endoscope
up my posterior,

1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:54.554
and all this time,
the only incriminating item

1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:57.279
you have in your possession
is a filing snafu?

1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:59.237
How about surveillance,
Miss Sloane?

1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:02.557
Mr. Rodolfo Schmidt
has stated in deposition

1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:05.235
that you intended
to use methods

1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:07.038
such as bugging and tapping

1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:10.351
to entrap Senator
Hank Badgley. Is this true?

1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:13.870
I did, for a brief moment,
intend to use such methods.

1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:15.996
But that intention
was never acted upon.

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:17.229
And why was that?

1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:19.271
Mr. Schmidt
expressly forbade it,

1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:21.316
as he no doubt told you
in his deposition.

1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:22.536
But you were clearly
comfortable

1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:23.595
with these methods.

1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:27.316
Did you employ the tactics
of espionage

1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:29.595
regularly throughout
your lobbying career?

1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:30.954
No, I did not.

1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:32.136
Then let me ask you this.

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:34.071
Have you ever authorized,
ordered,

1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:35.752
or otherwise brought about

1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:38.917
any kind of unlawful
surveillance on any person?

1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:41.951
Let me remind you that perjury

1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:43.758
before Congress
is a felony, which...

1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:44.875
The answer is no.

1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:49.597
I have never authorized
illegal surveillance.

1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:55.151
This concludes my questioning
of the witness.

1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:56.559
Thank you, Miss Sloane.

1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:07.199
We have one further witness.

1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:10.751
Either you just
perjured yourself,

1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:12.671
or you're not
so sleazy after all.

1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:15.280
The Committee
calls Mr. Robert Forde.

1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:17.439
I wouldn't count on that.

1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:20.628
Mr. Chairman, I don't recall

1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:22.200
being notified
of your intention to...

1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:23.275
We were only recently

1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:24.696
able to locate
the witness, Mr. Posner.

1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:25.755
Let it play.

1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.192
A moment
with my client, please?

1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:30.871
What is this?
Who's Robert Forde?

1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:33.639
Look, I can make
a public appeal...

1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:34.755
Let it play, damn it.

1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:36.920
They're going to get it
out there one way or another.

1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:52.715
Mr. Forde,
please raise your right hand.

1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:56.076
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

1:50:56.160 --> 1:50:58.071
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:00.192
under pains and penalties
of perjury?

1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:02.078
- I swear.
- Please sit.

1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:10.314
Mr. Forde,
could you please describe

1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:11.992
the nature of your work?

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:15.879
I got many jobs.

1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:21.077
What would you say earns you
the most income at present?

1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:24.000
I work as an escort in D.C.

1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.432
You sleep
with women for money?

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:33.479
I meet the clients' needs.

1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:35.674
Whatever they may be.

1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:39.359
Sometimes, the client don't
even know what they need.

1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:42.071
Part of my job's
to figure that out.

1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:43.798
But, sometimes,
your job entails

1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:46.237
having intercourse
for payment?

1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:49.194
Yes, sir.

1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:52.036
Have you ever met
Elizabeth Sloane?

1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:53.656
Mr. Chairman, the Senate
has no business

1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:55.560
prying into the personal
affairs of Miss Sloane.

1:51:55.640 --> 1:51:57.000
Solicitation
is a criminal offense.

1:51:57.040 --> 1:51:59.395
It's well within the remit
of this hearing

1:51:59.480 --> 1:52:00.799
to establish
whether Miss Sloane

1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:01.949
has broken any laws.

1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:03.835
Mr. Forde.

1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:06.715
Have you ever met Miss Sloane?

1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:09.395
Yep.

1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:11.398
Could you
identify her, please?

1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:14.869
Sittin' right there.

1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:18.029
What was the nature
of your relationship?

1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.150
I was attendin'
a function with a client.

1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000
I tried to introduce myself,
but she bucked me off.

1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:29.833
Mr. Forde, have you ever

1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:31.320
entertained Miss Sloane
as a client?

1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:37.509
No, sir.

1:52:39.280 --> 1:52:41.157
I can produce sworn statements

1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:43.674
from two employees
of the Carver Hotel,

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:46.672
to the effect that they saw
Miss Sloane in the lobby

1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:48.917
on the same day
that you, Mr. Forde,

1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.513
held a reservation there.

1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:52.029
I ask again.

1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:56.073
Did you entertain Miss Sloane
in any capacity, for profit?

1:52:56.280 --> 1:52:57.508
No, sir. I did not.

1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:02.752
Thank you,
Mr. Forde.

1:53:03.560 --> 1:53:04.879
You're dismissed.

1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:12.277
These proceedings
will conclude tomorrow,

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:16.955
when Miss Sloane is referred
to the Senate Ethics Committee

1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:18.439
for their judgment.

1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:31.315
I can't believe those fuckers
dragged that guy...

1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:32.549
Ross?

1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:37.800
How's our old friend
Heaton-Harris?

1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:42.829
Comatose. The whole
issue's gone cold.

1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:46.313
That is what they wanted.

1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:49.680
We all know what
it would take to revive it.

1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:52.910
Seriously, an earthquake.

1:53:55.400 --> 1:53:57.231
We got closer than
we had any right to.

1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:07.599
We'll all be there tomorrow.

1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:43.336
Excuse me,
Miss Sloane, over here.

1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:44.475
May I have a comment?

1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:03.709
Good morning.

1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:12.309
Before referring
the witness's testimony

1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:14.436
to the Office
of Congressional Ethics,

1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:16.158
she is entitled
to make a statement.

1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:22.436
Miss Sloane, is there
something you'd like to say?

1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:37.961
Mr. Chairman, my client does
not wish to make a statement.

1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:40.875
Very well.

1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:42.473
I will now read the referral

1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:44.312
to the office of
Congressional Ethics...

1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:46.197
There is something
I'd like to say, Senator.

1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:18.553
I have been censured by
the press and by this hearing

1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:20.799
as a parasite

1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:23.398
on American democracy.

1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:27.200
It's insinuated
that I led the fight

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:32.438
for increased gun regulation
in the interest of my career.

1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:37.196
Sometimes we act,
not for ourselves,

1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:41.955
but because we believe
plainly and simply

1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:43.433
it is the right thing to do.

1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:46.068
Miss Sloane, is this pertinent
to the discussions we...

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:49.277
I understand I have the right
to say what I wish, Senator.

1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:51.440
Proceed.

1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:55.192
I believe
the Heaton-Harris Bill

1:56:55.320 --> 1:56:56.594
is the right thing to do.

1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:00.874
But I also recognize

1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:05.479
that this wasn't
what motivated me.

1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:10.515
When I was offered a position
on the campaign,

1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:12.591
I was in thrall
to the challenge.

1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:19.830
My decision to accept
was based on my desire to win.

1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:25.631
And to win bigger
than I ever had before.

1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:32.758
It's clear that my behavior
has fallen well short

1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:37.471
of acceptable
ethical standards.

1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:43.359
I've crossed lines
with devastating consequences

1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:46.391
in the service
of my obsession.

1:57:48.840 --> 1:57:50.910
I've betrayed the people
closest to me.

1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:55.873
I've endangered lives.

1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:00.512
I deserve censure for this

1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:04.677
far more than for
any filing irregularity.

1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:10.154
When they consider
the Heaton-Harris Bill, I wish

1:58:11.520 --> 1:58:13.192
that each member of Congress

1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:15.595
would follow the example set,
not by me,

1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:19.873
but by the group of people
that sit behind me.

1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:24.075
Who have made great sacrifices

1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:28.195
in the name of doing
what they believe is right.

1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:33.958
I wish that those members
would use their votes,

1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:37.953
not in the interest of
their political advancement,

1:58:38.760 --> 1:58:43.197
but for what they believe
is right for their country.

1:58:45.400 --> 1:58:46.958
But I know my wishes
are wasted.

1:58:48.440 --> 1:58:50.112
And that this will
never happen.

1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:54.870
Because our system is rotten.

1:58:57.400 --> 1:58:59.675
It doesn't reward
honest politicians,

1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:01.034
who vote with
their conscience.

1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:04.233
It rewards

1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:06.469
rats

1:59:07.560 --> 1:59:09.357
who are willing to
sell out their country

1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:10.760
to keep their noses
in the trough.

1:59:12.720 --> 1:59:14.278
Make no mistake.

1:59:15.240 --> 1:59:18.357
These rats are
the real parasites

1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:20.992
on American democracy.

1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:36.913
I anticipated if we had
sufficient success

1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:38.991
in lobbying for
the Heaton-Harris Bill,

1:59:39.080 --> 1:59:40.479
there may be

1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:43.591
an assault
against me personally,

1:59:45.280 --> 1:59:49.512
to stall our momentum
and to damage our credibility.

1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:54.273
Lobbying is about foresight.

1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:58.111
About anticipating
your opponent's moves

2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:01.508
and devising counter-measures.

2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:03.833
I'd like to discuss my future.

2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:06.472
This is hardly
the time, cookie.

2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:10.636
The winner plots one step
ahead of the opposition,

2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:15.829
and plays a trump card
just after they play theirs.

2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:18.073
Actually, it is the time.

2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:20.240
It's about making sure

2:00:20.280 --> 2:00:21.508
you surprise them.

2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:24.039
The fuck is this?

2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:26.199
And that they don't
surprise you.

2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:28.399
My resignation.

2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:30.632
Academia's more my scene.

2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:38.632
When I left Cole, Kravitz,
and Waterman,

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:43.196
I retained an operative
of mine in their ranks.

2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:46.233
All right, Jane.

2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:47.616
Contact Rodolfo Schmidt
and tell him

2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:49.016
there is a total
of six coming over.

2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:50.075
Who says I'm coming?

2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:52.280
A plan was hatched to

2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:53.480
bankroll a trumped-up hearing

2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.837
at the behest
of the gun lobby.

2:00:55.920 --> 2:00:57.433
There's got to be something.

2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:00.480
I'm surprised you picked up.

2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:02.040
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:05.280
She's in breach
of Senate Ethics rules.

2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:07.509
We can prove it.

2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:10.350
I placed George Dupont
under surveillance

2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:13.357
until he met with
a member of Congress

2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:15.950
who exhibited sufficient
moral bankruptcy

2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:18.715
to collude with such a plan.

2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:20.034
And go.

2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:25.557
That member was

2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:28.035
Senator
Ronald Michael Sperling.

2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:31.275
Order.

2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:33.351
This is not a platform
you can use

2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:35.160
to make malicious,
defamatory accusations...

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:37.040
Input the following address
into your browser.

2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:42.870
193-dot-184

2:01:43.640 --> 2:01:48.873
dot-216-dot-449.

2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:52.756
Download a file
named "Earthquake."

2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:56.516
I can't
vote for it with one hand

2:01:56.600 --> 2:01:58.238
and choke it with the other...

2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:08.634
Get the car.

2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:20.748
In light of these allegations,
this hearing is adjourned.

2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:30.839
Back up, please.
Back up. Back up.

2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:09.279
I'm surprised you showed.

2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:11.160
I hear I'm not the only one

2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:12.520
whose visits
you've been refusing.

2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:16.873
You look good.

2:04:17.720 --> 2:04:19.711
Prison's not so bad
if you don't have a penis.

2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:22.509
We don't shank each other,
we form self-help groups.

2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:25.440
There's a black market
in lip gloss.

2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:26.720
Hmm.

2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:29.029
Why this time?

2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:32.873
They told me it was business.

2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:34.714
Yeah. Um...

2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:36.856
Now that the Sperling
and Dupont hearings

2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:37.949
are on the schedule,

2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:39.519
I'm petitioning
for an early release.

2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:41.554
You look good, too,
by the way.

2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:43.393
Thank you.

2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:48.235
I think we are looking
at four, maybe six months.

2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:55.113
You instigated
the whole thing.

2:04:58.280 --> 2:04:59.793
You weaponized yourself,

2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:02.678
brought the roof
of the US Capitol

2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:04.079
crashing down on your head.

2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.150
For what, a gun bill?

2:05:09.160 --> 2:05:11.469
- Worked, didn't it?
- Well, congrats.

2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:13.840
Criminals must now
endure the hassle

2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:15.672
of procuring their guns
on the black market.

2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:19.158
Was that really
worth your career?

2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:23.272
Career suicide is
not so bad when you

2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:26.000
consider the alternative
is suicide by career.

2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:29.114
My doctor would tell you

2:05:29.640 --> 2:05:31.437
I've served
my interest very well.

2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:35.200
Hmm.

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:39.434
Thanks for coming, Daniel.

2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:43.388
I'm curious.

2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:47.553
Your little filing snafu?

2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:50.920
You filled out
that form deliberately.

2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:52.360
That was you,
throwing them a bone.

2:05:53.680 --> 2:05:55.961
Without it, they would have
nothing to incite the hearing.

2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:59.116
And you're under no obligation
to answer that.

2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:06.839
And you neglected
to mention this

2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:08.160
to any of your team because...

2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:09.315
Five years minimum.

2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:17.434
I'll be seeing you.
