00:07.926 --> 00:09.260
A famous man once said,

00:09.427 --> 00:12.097
"We create our own demons."

00:13.640 --> 00:15.642
Who said that? What does that even mean?

00:15.809 --> 00:17.602
It doesn't matter. I said it because he said it.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.312
So, now, he was famous

00:19.479 --> 00:21.898
and it's basically getting said by two well-known guys.

00:22.232 --> 00:23.608
I don't...

00:23.817 --> 00:25.819
I'm going to start again.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.489
Let's track this from the beginning.

01:06.651 --> 01:07.861
Half hour till the ball drops.

01:09.195 --> 01:10.196
- Hey, do you wanna...  - Tony Stark?

01:10.280 --> 01:11.531
- Great speech, man!  - I got you, pal.

01:11.781 --> 01:13.408
I gave a speech? How was it?

01:14.075 --> 01:15.076
- Edifying.  - Unintelligible.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.911
Really? It's my favourite kind. A winning combo.

01:16.995 --> 01:18.788
- Where are we going?  - To town, on each other.

01:18.872 --> 01:19.914
Probably back in your room

01:19.998 --> 01:21.124
because I also want to see your research.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.208
Okay, you can see my research,

01:22.292 --> 01:24.252
but that's... I'm not gonna show you my "town."

01:24.335 --> 01:25.545
Mr Stark.

01:25.628 --> 01:26.588
Ho Yinsen.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.673
I finally met a man called "Ho."

01:28.840 --> 01:32.093
I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.

01:32.343 --> 01:33.636
- Oh, this guy.  - Mr Stark.

01:34.846 --> 01:38.057
You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I...

01:40.977 --> 01:42.771
Perhaps another time?

01:43.354 --> 01:47.192
It started in Bern, Switzerland. 1999.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.361
- The old days.  - Mr Stark!

01:50.653 --> 01:52.822
I never thought they would come back to bite me.

01:52.906 --> 01:53.907
Why would they?

01:53.990 --> 01:55.700
Wow! Hey, Tony!

01:56.534 --> 01:59.370
Aldrich Killian. I'm a big fan of your work.

01:59.621 --> 02:00.622
- My work?  - Who isn't? He means me.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.249
Of course, but Ms Hansen,

02:03.416 --> 02:06.753
my organisation's been tracking your research since year two of MIT.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.921
Yeah, we're full.

02:08.755 --> 02:10.381
Wow, he made it. He made the cut.

02:10.548 --> 02:11.633
What floor you going to, pal?

02:11.716 --> 02:13.218
Well, now, that is an appropriate question.

02:13.384 --> 02:14.385
The ground floor, actually,

02:14.552 --> 02:16.471
of a proposal I'm putting together myself.

02:16.679 --> 02:20.391
It's a privately funded think tank called.

02:20.642 --> 02:24.395
She'll take both. One to throw away and one to not call.

02:24.562 --> 02:28.149
"Advanced Idea Mechanics," or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

02:28.233 --> 02:29.651
I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.404
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.198
Thank you, I'll call you.

02:37.909 --> 02:40.119
I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.454
- Yeah?  - I'll ditch these clowns.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.248
I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.874
Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.042
You know what I'm talking about?

02:46.125 --> 02:47.126
I'll see you up there.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.586
Damn betcha.

02:48.878 --> 02:51.339
Come on! I thought that was just a theory.

02:51.506 --> 02:52.715
Well, it was.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.509
If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain

02:54.592 --> 02:55.593
- that governs repair...  - Wow.

02:55.677 --> 02:57.011
and chemically recode it.

02:57.095 --> 02:59.514
That's incredible. Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic...

02:59.597 --> 03:01.682
operating system of a living organism

03:01.765 --> 03:02.141
Exactly.

03:02.475 --> 03:03.518
- Yes.  - Wow.

03:03.601 --> 03:04.644
Is that... Can you...

03:04.727 --> 03:06.229
- What?  - Can you not touch my plant?

03:06.396 --> 03:08.022
It's not... She doesn't like it. She prefers...

03:08.231 --> 03:10.108
She's not like the others. Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

03:10.483 --> 03:12.235
- Happy...  - That's cute...

03:12.318 --> 03:13.778
Leave her ficus alone.

03:13.862 --> 03:14.904
Because. And, no, seriously, don't.

03:14.988 --> 03:17.115
- And you're starting with plants.  - For now, yeah.

03:17.282 --> 03:19.450
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.161
- Well, it's...  - Human application.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.454
Exactly, exactly.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.582
- Dendritic revitalisation.  - It's revolutionary.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.041
- Disease prevention...  - Change the world.

03:27.125 --> 03:28.585
even limb regrowth.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.462
You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.

03:31.629 --> 03:32.797
Wow.

03:32.881 --> 03:35.425
- In Switzerland.  - That's better.

03:35.508 --> 03:37.552
- You're seeing things.  - This week.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.679
You almost bought it, didn't you?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.317
This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.693
Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?

03:53.860 --> 03:54.861
- The what?  - Down!

03:55.403 --> 03:57.322
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

03:57.488 --> 03:58.948
- We're good.  - Stay down.

03:59.115 --> 04:01.159
You're right on me. I made it.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.828
What the hell was that?

04:05.079 --> 04:06.789
- What was that?  - It's a glitch in my work. It's...

04:07.123 --> 04:08.458
She was just talking about it. Glitches happen.

04:08.625 --> 04:09.667
It's not Y2K.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.502
Hey! Happy New Year!

04:11.669 --> 04:12.837
- Happy New Year.  - Happy New Year.

04:13.004 --> 04:14.297
All right. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.423
- You good?  - Yeah.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.467
- I'll be right outside.  - Okay, cool.

04:37.028 --> 04:38.905
So, why am I telling you this?

04:39.614 --> 04:42.784
Because I had just created demons

04:43.618 --> 04:45.370
and I didn't even know it.

04:47.914 --> 04:49.749
Yeah, those were good times.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.460
Then I moved on.

04:52.919 --> 04:55.213
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.216
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.302
- These days, I'm a changed man.  - Forty-six.

05:01.386 --> 05:03.763
I'm different now.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.014
I'm... Well...

05:05.098 --> 05:07.600
- Forty-seven.  - You know who I am.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.603
Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...

05:10.770 --> 05:12.105
No. Forty-eight.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.151
Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.

05:17.235 --> 05:18.236
As you wish, sir.

05:18.528 --> 05:21.364
I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.

05:21.531 --> 05:23.074
Which I will.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.659
All right, let's do this.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.703
DUM-E.

05:26.786 --> 05:27.787
Hi, DUM-E.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.206
How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.208
Hey. Hey!

05:33.710 --> 05:35.712
What are you doing out of the corner? You know what you did.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.089
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

05:38.381 --> 05:42.176
Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly 72 hours?

05:43.011 --> 05:44.012
Focus up, ladies.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.931
Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite.

05:47.140 --> 05:49.392
I am pleased to announce the imminent arrival

05:49.600 --> 05:52.437
of your bouncing, bad-ass baby brother.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.480
Start tight and then go wide.

05:54.647 --> 05:56.024
Stamp date and time.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.193
Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.112
lnitialise sequence.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.491
Jarvis, drop my needle.

06:29.682 --> 06:30.975
Crap.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.787
All right, I think we got this. Send them all.

06:59.504 --> 07:00.671
Probably a little fast. Slow it down.

07:00.755 --> 07:01.798
Slow it down just a...

07:02.173 --> 07:03.174
little bit.

07:11.099 --> 07:12.517
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

07:23.361 --> 07:25.613
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

07:33.246 --> 07:34.247
I'm the best.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.840
As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.802
I guess 72 hours is a long time between siestas.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.888
I didn't think it could get any worse.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.268
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.606
That's when he happened.

08:09.157 --> 08:11.534
Some people call me a terrorist.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.914
I consider myself a teacher.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.751
America.

08:22.545 --> 08:25.047
Ready for another lesson?

08:25.756 --> 08:30.344
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado, the US military waited

08:30.636 --> 08:33.681
until the friendly Cheyenne braves had all gone hunting.

08:33.848 --> 08:38.060
Waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind

08:38.436 --> 08:41.439
and claim their land.

08:41.814 --> 08:43.399
39 hours ago,

08:44.025 --> 08:48.362
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.698
I... I... I did that.

08:50.907 --> 08:52.116
A quaint military church

08:52.283 --> 08:55.661
filled with wives and children, of course.

08:57.455 --> 09:00.708
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.

09:01.626 --> 09:04.045
The braves were away.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.589
President Ellis.

09:06.756 --> 09:10.051
You continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir.

09:10.218 --> 09:12.845
And now you've missed me again.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.808
You know who I am.

09:18.142 --> 09:19.977
You don't know where I am.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.981
And you'll never see me coming.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.611
Now that we seem to be back,

09:28.694 --> 09:30.196
let's recap some of the frightening developments...

09:30.446 --> 09:32.156
American airwaves were hijacked...

09:32.448 --> 09:33.824
The nation remains on high alert.

09:34.033 --> 09:36.535
All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.997
Central to my administration's response to this terrorist event

09:40.289 --> 09:42.208
is a newly minted resource.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.544
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.797
The American people will soon know him

09:47.964 --> 09:49.507
as the Iron Patriot.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.468
And how is President Ellis responding?

09:52.551 --> 09:54.720
By taking the guy they call War Machine

09:54.804 --> 09:56.430
and giving him a paint job.

09:56.597 --> 10:00.184
The same suit, but painted red, white and blue.

10:00.268 --> 10:04.146
Look at that. And they also renamed him, "lron Patriot."

10:04.230 --> 10:07.149
You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.

10:07.483 --> 10:09.318
It tested well with focus groups, all right?

10:09.485 --> 10:11.112
"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.

10:11.279 --> 10:12.613
"War Machine" was a little too aggressive.

10:12.697 --> 10:14.115
All right? This sends a better message.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.537
So, what's really going on? With the Mandarin.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.040
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

10:26.002 --> 10:28.671
It's classified information, Tony.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.257
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.551
- Nine.  - The public only knows about three.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.721
But here's the thing, nobody can ID a device.

10:36.887 --> 10:37.930
There's no bomb casings.

10:38.264 --> 10:40.308
You know I can help. Just ask.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.101
I got a ton of new tech. I got a prehensile suit.

10:42.393 --> 10:45.563
I got bomb disposal. It catches explosions in mid-air.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.148
When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?

10:47.315 --> 10:49.900
Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did.

10:50.109 --> 10:52.403
People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.

10:52.737 --> 10:53.738
You're going to come at me like that?

10:53.946 --> 10:55.448
I'm not trying to be a dick...

10:56.157 --> 10:57.158
Tator.

10:57.408 --> 10:58.743
Do you mind signing my drawing?

10:59.035 --> 11:01.203
If Richard doesn't mind. Are you all right with this, Dick?

11:01.287 --> 11:02.872
Yeah. Fine with me.

11:04.415 --> 11:06.334
- What's your name?  - Erin.

11:07.585 --> 11:10.421
I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.090
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

11:13.257 --> 11:16.010
After New York, aliens... Come on.

11:16.177 --> 11:17.762
They need to look strong.

11:18.012 --> 11:21.015
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it's not...

11:21.182 --> 11:22.892
- it's not superhero business.  - No, it's not, quite frankly.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.518
- I get it.  - It's American business.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.437
That's why I said I got it.

11:27.188 --> 11:28.606
Are you okay?

11:29.273 --> 11:30.316
I broke the crayon.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.109
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

11:32.276 --> 11:34.028
Take it easy. Tony.

11:35.196 --> 11:37.198
How did you get out of the Wormhole?

11:37.907 --> 11:38.949
Wait a minute. Tony!

11:39.075 --> 11:40.076
- What did you say?  - Tony.

11:41.744 --> 11:42.745
Sorry.

11:42.912 --> 11:44.372
I'm just checking on the suit.

11:45.456 --> 11:46.457
Okay.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.128
Check the heart.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.630
Is it the brain?

11:52.797 --> 11:55.633
No sign of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.551
Okay, so I was poisoned?

11:58.302 --> 12:02.973
My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.602
Me?

12:07.144 --> 12:08.771
Come on, man, this isn't a good look. Open up.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.940
Sorry, I gotta split.

12:13.234 --> 12:14.276
Badge.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.736
Badge.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.197
Come on, badge.

12:19.490 --> 12:22.118
Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.495
Tony has got them in his basement. They're wearing party hats.

12:24.662 --> 12:26.664
This is an asset that we can put to use.

12:26.831 --> 12:30.793
So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.461
- Thank you.  - What I'm saying is that

12:32.628 --> 12:35.631
the human element of human resources is our biggest point of vulnerability.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.050
We should start phasing it out immediately.

12:38.217 --> 12:39.593
- What?  - Excuse me, Bambi,

12:39.677 --> 12:40.970
- you should be wearing...  - Did you just say that?

12:41.178 --> 12:42.638
- Security? Yes?  - Happy? Okay.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.433
I am thrilled that you are now the Head Of Security. Okay?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.226
- It is the perfect position for you.  - Thank you.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.853
- However...  - I do appreciate it.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.855
- since you've taken the post...  - You don't have to thank me.

12:51.021 --> 12:54.442
we've had a rise in staff complaints of 300%.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.609
Thank you.

12:56.152 --> 12:57.236
It's not a compliment.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.571
It's not... It is a compliment.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.197
Clearly, somebody's trying to hide something.

13:00.406 --> 13:01.490
- I... Yes.  - Excuse me.

13:01.574 --> 13:03.534
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.035
- Thank you.  - Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

13:05.202 --> 13:06.912
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

13:06.996 --> 13:09.373
but right now, I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.833
How so?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.335
I used to work with him and he used to ask me out all the time,

13:13.502 --> 13:14.545
so it's a little awkward.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.464
I don't like the sound of that.

13:21.469 --> 13:22.470
Pepper

13:23.429 --> 13:24.430
Killian?

13:24.597 --> 13:26.265
You look great.

13:26.599 --> 13:27.975
You look really great.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.311
God, you look great.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.604
I... I... I...

13:32.188 --> 13:33.439
What on earth have you been doing?

13:33.898 --> 13:34.899
Nothing fancy.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.276
Just five years in the hands of physical therapists.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.320
And please, call me Aldrich.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.572
You were supposed to be issued a security badge.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.116
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.  - Yes.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.744
- Are you sure? Okay.  - Yes. Stand down.

13:46.911 --> 13:48.537
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.  - Thank you.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.832
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

13:58.047 --> 13:59.548
Hey, guy

14:07.223 --> 14:08.224
Merry Christmas.

14:08.557 --> 14:13.562
After years dodging the President's ban on "immoral" biotech research,

14:13.646 --> 14:14.980
my think tank

14:16.607 --> 14:19.109
now has a little something in the pipeline.

14:19.985 --> 14:24.073
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.325
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.121
Regard the human brain.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.504
Wait, hold on, hold on.

14:38.671 --> 14:40.548
That's... That's the universe. My bad.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.508
But if I do that...

14:47.513 --> 14:49.139
That's the brain.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.642
Strangely mimetic, though, wouldn't you say?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.060
Wow, that's amazing.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.812
Thanks, it's mine.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.146
What?

14:56.814 --> 14:58.107
This. You're inside my head.

14:58.399 --> 15:00.276
It's a... It's a live feed.

15:00.568 --> 15:02.194
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

15:03.821 --> 15:04.989
Come on.

15:07.992 --> 15:08.993
Now, pinch my arm.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.162
I can take it. Pinch me.

15:13.372 --> 15:14.582
What is that?

15:14.873 --> 15:18.002
It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain centre.

15:18.669 --> 15:21.589
But this is what I wanted to show you.

15:24.216 --> 15:28.345
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses our bioelectrical potential

15:28.512 --> 15:31.348
and it goes here.

15:31.515 --> 15:34.643
This is essentially an empty slot and what this tells us

15:34.893 --> 15:36.520
is that our mind,

15:36.604 --> 15:38.105
our entire DNA, in fact,

15:38.272 --> 15:40.107
is destined to be upgraded.

15:40.274 --> 15:41.358
Wow.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.153
Wait...

15:50.409 --> 15:51.410
Hello?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.370
- Is this Forehead Of Security?  - What?

15:53.746 --> 15:55.205
You know, look... I got a real job. What do you want?

15:55.372 --> 15:56.582
I'm working. I've got something going on, here.

15:56.749 --> 15:57.791
What, harassing interns?

15:57.875 --> 15:59.168
Let me tell you something. Do you know what happened

15:59.251 --> 16:00.252
when I told people I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

16:00.336 --> 16:02.296
They would laugh in my face.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.757
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.675
Now I got a real job. I'm watching Pepper.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.552
What's going on? Fill me in.

16:08.719 --> 16:09.845
- For real?  - Yeah.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.513
All right. She's meeting up with this scientist.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.223
- Rich guy. Handsome.  - Right.

16:13.349 --> 16:15.726
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right? You know I'm good with faces.

16:15.809 --> 16:16.810
- Yeah, you're the best.  - Yeah.

16:16.894 --> 16:18.228
Well, so I run his credentials. I make him.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.856
Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in...

16:21.023 --> 16:23.567
Where were we in '99? The science conference?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.195
- Switzerland.  - Right, right, exactly.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.780
Killian. No... I don't remember that guy.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.365
Of course you don't remember him. He's not a blond with a big rack.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.075
At first, it was fine. They were talking business.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.328
But now it's getting weird. He's showing her his big brain.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.163
- His what?  - Big brain.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.665
And she likes it. Here, let me show you.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.875
Hold on. See?

16:40.459 --> 16:41.460
Look at what? You, watching them?

16:41.794 --> 16:43.545
Flip the screen, and then we can get started.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.465
I'm not a tech genius like you. Just trust me. Get down here.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.300
Flip the screen. Then I can see what they're doing.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.593
I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen!

16:49.927 --> 16:52.429
Don't talk to me like that any more. You're not my boss.

16:52.888 --> 16:53.931
All right? I don't work for you.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.642
And I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him.

16:56.725 --> 16:57.768
He's shifty.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.852
- Relax.  - Seriously?

16:58.936 --> 17:00.437
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.855
Tell them to go out for a drink or something.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.607
You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.442
This woman's the best thing that ever happened to you

17:05.526 --> 17:06.944
and you're just ignoring her.

17:07.111 --> 17:08.112
- A giant brain?  - Yeah.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.530
There's a giant brain. There's a shifty character.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.157
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and I'm gonna...

17:12.449 --> 17:13.784
You know, if it gets rough, so be it.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.619
I miss you, Happy...

17:15.786 --> 17:17.788
Yeah, I miss you, too. But the way it used to be.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.123
Now you're off with the super-friends.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.416
I don't know what's going on with you any more.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.542
- The world's getting weird.  - Hey!

17:21.625 --> 17:22.626
I hate to cut you off.

17:22.710 --> 17:23.711
- Do you have your Taser on you?  - Why?

17:23.794 --> 17:26.004
I think there's a gal in H.R. who's trying to steal some printer ink.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.173
You should probably go over there and zap her.

17:28.257 --> 17:29.550
Yeah, nice.

17:30.050 --> 17:34.471
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism

17:34.638 --> 17:36.598
and recode its DNA.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.684
That would be incredible.

17:38.851 --> 17:42.479
Unfortunately, to my ears, it also sounds highly weaponisable.

17:42.646 --> 17:46.233
As in, enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is...

17:46.400 --> 17:47.985
Tony, Tony.

17:49.027 --> 17:53.782
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM 13 years ago.

17:53.866 --> 17:54.908
He turned me down.

17:55.993 --> 17:59.455
But something tells me, now there's a new genius on the throne

17:59.538 --> 18:02.791
who doesn't have to answer to Tony any more

18:02.875 --> 18:04.835
and who has slightly less of an ego.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.922
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.384
As much as I'd like to help you.

18:13.677 --> 18:17.014
Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.807
But then, as my father used to say,

18:18.891 --> 18:21.643
"Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph."

18:21.852 --> 18:23.187
That's very deep.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.688
And I have no idea what it means.

18:24.897 --> 18:28.650
No, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.695
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.456
Happy...

18:43.874 --> 18:45.626
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.463
Yes, I just...

18:49.546 --> 18:52.966
God, I forgot my other things, so...

18:53.801 --> 18:55.177
I'm just gonna...

19:22.746 --> 19:23.914
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

19:23.997 --> 19:25.374
What the... What is that?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.961
You're wearing this in the house now?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.629
What is that, like, Mark 15?

19:32.631 --> 19:34.508
Yeah. Something like that. You know, everybody needs a hobby.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.802
And you have to wear your hobby in the living room?

19:36.885 --> 19:38.595
Just breaking it in.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.807
You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so...

19:41.890 --> 19:44.059
Well, hey, did you see your Christmas present?

19:44.268 --> 19:45.477
Yes, I did. I...

19:45.561 --> 19:48.063
I don't know how I could've missed that Christmas present.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.190
Is it gonna fit through the door?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.608
Well, actually, it's a good question.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.236
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna blow out that wall.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.779
- Okay.  - So...

19:55.863 --> 19:57.531
Tense? Good day? Huh?

19:57.614 --> 20:00.284
Shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.954
I don't want to harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?

20:04.162 --> 20:05.163
Did I like it?

20:05.581 --> 20:06.999
- Nailed it, right?  - Wow.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.877
I appreciate the thought very much.

20:11.086 --> 20:14.548
So, why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?

20:16.842 --> 20:19.344
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

20:19.428 --> 20:23.307
You want to just kiss it on the... The facial slit?

20:23.390 --> 20:25.392
Well, why don't I run down to the garage

20:25.475 --> 20:28.061
and see if I can't find a crowbar to jimmy that thing open?

20:28.145 --> 20:29.813
Crowbar, yeah.

20:29.897 --> 20:32.232
Except there's been a radiation leak.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.234
- I'll take my chances.  - That's risky.

20:34.568 --> 20:37.446
At least, let me get you, like, a hazmat suit.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.908
A Geiger counter or something like that.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.118
Busted.

20:43.619 --> 20:46.788
- This is a new level of lame.  - Sorry.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.333
You ate without me already? On date night?

20:50.208 --> 20:51.418
- He was just...  - You mean you.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.171
Well, yeah, I just mean we were hosting you...

20:55.172 --> 20:57.174
while I finished up a little work.

20:57.341 --> 20:58.550
And yes, I had a quick bite.

20:58.634 --> 20:59.593
I didn't know if you were coming home

20:59.676 --> 21:01.428
or you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.558
- What?  - What?

21:06.642 --> 21:09.227
Aldrich Killian? What, are you checking up on me?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.312
Happy was concerned.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.521
- You're spying on me.  - I wasn't.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.731
- I'm going to bed.  - Hold on.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.275
Come on. Pep?

21:15.359 --> 21:16.360
Hey, I admit it.

21:16.526 --> 21:19.488
My fault. Sorry.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.699
I'm a piping hot mess.

21:23.909 --> 21:27.871
It's been going on for a while. I haven't said anything.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.457
Nothing's been the same since New York.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.003
Really? I didn't notice that at all.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.673
You experience things

21:37.756 --> 21:39.383
and then they're over, and you still can't explain them.

21:40.634 --> 21:44.638
Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I'm just a man in a can.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.098
The only reason I haven't cracked up

21:46.390 --> 21:48.141
is probably because you moved in.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.643
Which is great.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.269
I love you. I'm lucky.

21:51.561 --> 21:54.314
But honey, I can't sleep.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.735
You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.570
I tinker. I....

22:01.571 --> 22:03.490
Threat is imminent.

22:03.573 --> 22:07.202
And I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.

22:07.285 --> 22:08.996
That's you.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.331
And my suits, they're...

22:11.415 --> 22:12.416
Machines.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.251
They're part of me.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.503
A distraction.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.672
Maybe.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.358
I'm gonna take a shower.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.152
Okay.

22:42.612 --> 22:43.613
And you're gonna join me.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.742
Better.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.511
Tony.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.639
Tony. Tony.

23:10.474 --> 23:12.100
To...

23:15.145 --> 23:16.521
Power down!

23:23.904 --> 23:26.323
I must have called it in my sleep.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.700
That's not supposed to happen.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.205
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

23:35.082 --> 23:38.085
Can we just... Just let me...

23:38.168 --> 23:40.587
Just let me catch my breath. Hey, don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

23:40.670 --> 23:42.798
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.133
Tinker with that.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.828
Can you regulate?

24:12.994 --> 24:13.954
Yes, I can regulate.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.163
- You sure about that?  - Yes.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.134
It's a decent batch.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.554
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.  - Thank you.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.142
I mean, for understanding.

24:43.733 --> 24:44.734
I'm sorry, buddy.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.127
What are you doing, buddy?

25:02.210 --> 25:03.545
You out by yourself? A little date night?

25:03.628 --> 25:04.713
Seeing your favourite chick flick, maybe?

25:05.255 --> 25:07.007
Yeah, a little movie called The Party's Over,

25:07.090 --> 25:08.967
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.051
Here's the ticket.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.429
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

25:38.914 --> 25:39.956
Savin!

25:40.957 --> 25:42.125
Help!

25:42.292 --> 25:44.002
Help me!

27:09.379 --> 27:12.173
True story about fortune cookies.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.591
They look Chinese.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.553
They sound Chinese.

27:17.012 --> 27:20.765
But they're actually an American invention.

27:20.849 --> 27:25.645
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies

27:25.729 --> 27:27.897
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

27:29.065 --> 27:33.737
My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff.

27:34.571 --> 27:37.115
The Chinese Theatre.

27:37.532 --> 27:39.701
Mr President,

27:39.784 --> 27:42.078
I know this must be getting frustrating.

27:42.746 --> 27:47.500
But this season of terror is drawing to a close.

27:47.584 --> 27:51.588
And don't worry, the big one is coming.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.048
Your graduation.

28:07.729 --> 28:08.855
Hi.

28:09.773 --> 28:10.815
Do you mind leaving that on?

28:11.524 --> 28:12.692
Sure.

28:18.782 --> 28:23.119
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.

28:23.912 --> 28:26.831
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.544
One more thing. Make sure everyone wears their badges.

28:31.628 --> 28:32.837
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

28:32.921 --> 28:36.049
Plus, my guys won't let anyone in without them.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.176
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.803
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...

28:39.928 --> 28:41.513
His reaction to the latest attack.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.182
Mr Stark, hi there.

28:44.265 --> 28:47.519
Our sources are telling us that all signs are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.729
Anything else you can tell us?

28:49.813 --> 28:52.816
Hey, Mr Stark. When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

28:53.650 --> 28:54.651
I'm just saying.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.781
Is that what you want?

29:01.991 --> 29:03.660
Here's a little holiday greeting

29:03.743 --> 29:06.162
I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.623
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.

29:09.332 --> 29:12.377
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.505
I know you're a coward. So I've decided

29:16.339 --> 29:17.841
that you just died, pal.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.051
I'm gonna come get the body.

29:20.343 --> 29:22.887
There's no politics here. It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

29:23.513 --> 29:26.182
There's no Pentagon, it's just you and me.

29:26.516 --> 29:30.103
And on the off chance you're a man, here's my home address.

29:30.186 --> 29:33.690
10880 Malibu Point.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.942
90265.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.861
I'll leave the door unlocked.

29:37.944 --> 29:38.945
That's what you wanted, right?

29:42.449 --> 29:44.033
Bill me.

29:48.246 --> 29:51.458
I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir,

29:51.541 --> 29:55.753
drawn from S.H.l.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.381
Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.

30:00.550 --> 30:04.345
Okay. What have we got here?

30:04.429 --> 30:08.766
The name is an ancient Chinese war mantle meaning "adviser to the king."

30:08.850 --> 30:12.145
South American insurgency tactics.

30:12.228 --> 30:14.689
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

30:14.772 --> 30:19.110
There's lots of pageantry going on here. Lots of theatre. Close.

30:19.194 --> 30:22.780
The heat from the blast was in excess of 3,000 degrees Celsius.

30:22.864 --> 30:26.493
Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporised instantly.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.245
No bomb parts found in a three-mile radius of the Chinese Theatre?

30:29.329 --> 30:30.330
No, sir.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.374
Talk to me, Happy.

30:52.143 --> 30:54.020
When is a bomb not a bomb?

31:05.406 --> 31:06.449
Any military victims?

31:07.659 --> 31:09.077
Not according to public record, sir.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.287
Bring up the thermogenic signatures again.

31:11.371 --> 31:13.081
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

31:13.164 --> 31:15.875
The Oracle cloud has completed analysis.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.043
Accessing satellites

31:17.126 --> 31:21.005
and plotting the last 12 months of thermogenic occurrences now.

31:21.673 --> 31:24.133
Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.

31:29.514 --> 31:30.598
Nope.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.731
That. Are you sure that's not one of his?

31:38.815 --> 31:41.276
It predates any known Mandarin attack.

31:41.359 --> 31:44.195
The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.114
Bring her around.

31:46.823 --> 31:49.200
The heat signature is remarkably similar.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.327
3,000 degree Celsius.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.206
That's two military guys.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.166
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

31:57.667 --> 32:00.169
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.260
Are we still at ding-dong?

32:07.343 --> 32:09.762
We're supposed to be on total...

32:09.846 --> 32:10.972
security lockdown.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.807
Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.602
There's only so much I can do, sir,

32:15.685 --> 32:19.606
when you give the world's press your home address.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.867
Right there is fine.

32:34.746 --> 32:36.581
You're not the Mandarin.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.750
Are you? Are you?

32:40.293 --> 32:41.919
You don't remember.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.129
Why am I not surprised?

32:43.338 --> 32:45.465
Don't take it personally. I don't remember what I had for breakfast.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.008
Gluten-free waffles, sir.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.384
That's right.

32:48.593 --> 32:51.387
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you, someplace not here.

32:51.471 --> 32:52.472
It's urgent.

32:54.432 --> 32:58.770
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.

32:58.853 --> 32:59.896
It's...

33:01.230 --> 33:02.732
- With her.  - Tony?

33:04.067 --> 33:07.278
- Is somebody there?  - Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.405
Old botanist pal

33:09.489 --> 33:11.866
that I used to know, barely.

33:12.075 --> 33:13.660
Please don't tell me there's a 12-year-old kid

33:13.743 --> 33:14.827
waiting in the car that I've never met.

33:14.911 --> 33:15.912
He's 13.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.789
No, I need your help.

33:17.872 --> 33:19.457
But, what for? Why now?

33:19.540 --> 33:22.794
Because I read the papers, and frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.

33:22.877 --> 33:23.920
I'll be fine.

33:24.337 --> 33:27.465
I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.425
- We weren't.  - And old girlfriends.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.260
- She's not, really.  - No, not really.

33:31.344 --> 33:34.514
- It was just one night.  - Yep.

33:34.597 --> 33:36.307
That's how you did it, isn't it?

33:36.391 --> 33:38.726
- It was a great night.  - Yep. Well, you know.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.728
- You saved yourself a world of pain.  - What?

33:40.812 --> 33:42.397
- I'm sure...  - Trust me. We're going out of town.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.481
Okay. We've been through this.

33:43.564 --> 33:44.607
- Nope.  - Yep!

33:44.691 --> 33:46.609
- The man says no...  - Immediately and indefinitely.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.236
- Honey...  - Great idea. Let's go.

33:48.319 --> 33:50.947
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.532
This is how normal people behave.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.784
I can't protect you out there.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.703
Is... Is that normal?

33:56.911 --> 33:58.955
- Sadly, that is...  - Yes, this is normal!

33:59.038 --> 34:00.707
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

34:01.040 --> 34:02.041
Calm down.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.043
- I got this for you.  - I'm aware of that.

34:04.168 --> 34:05.461
You still haven't even told me you liked it.

34:05.545 --> 34:06.838
I don't like it.

34:06.921 --> 34:07.922
I asked you three... You don't like it?

34:08.172 --> 34:09.215
- We are leaving the house.  - Guys?

34:09.298 --> 34:10.383
That's not even up for discussion.

34:10.466 --> 34:12.677
- Can we...  - I said no. What?

34:12.760 --> 34:13.970
Do we need to worry about that?

35:03.478 --> 35:04.479
I got you.

35:04.729 --> 35:06.731
I got you first.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.149
Like I said, we can't stay here.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.535
Move! I'm right behind you.

35:23.748 --> 35:24.749
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.543
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

35:28.377 --> 35:29.670
Go!

35:52.026 --> 35:53.778
Oh, my God. Tony!

36:08.042 --> 36:10.920
Sir, Ms Potts is clear of the structure.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.370
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

36:44.537 --> 36:46.497
Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.597
That's one.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.101
Sir, the suit is not combat ready.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.201
That's two.

38:37.024 --> 38:39.068
Tony!

39:12.935 --> 39:14.603
Sir, take a deep breath.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.163
Flight power restored.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.637
Sir?

39:49.305 --> 39:50.431
Sir!

39:51.140 --> 39:53.559
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

39:53.642 --> 39:57.688
That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below 5%.

40:34.683 --> 40:37.645
It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?

40:37.728 --> 40:41.440
We are five miles outside of Rose Hill, Tennessee.

40:41.524 --> 40:42.942
Why?

40:43.025 --> 40:45.694
Jarvis. Not my idea.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.489
What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away!

40:48.572 --> 40:49.990
I gotta get Pepper, I got

40:50.533 --> 40:52.827
I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.

40:52.910 --> 40:53.911
Who asked you?

40:54.703 --> 40:55.955
Open the suit.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.248
I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

40:57.331 --> 40:58.332
Open it, J.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.507
That's brisk.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.308
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

41:16.559 --> 41:19.311
I actually think I need to sleep now, sir.

41:19.603 --> 41:20.980
Jarvis.

41:23.107 --> 41:24.567
Jarvis?

41:27.069 --> 41:29.238
Don't leave me, buddy.

41:50.259 --> 41:54.597
Stark secure server now transferring to all known receivers.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.015
Pepper, it's me.

41:56.223 --> 41:59.393
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time.

41:59.476 --> 42:02.354
So... First off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.

42:02.438 --> 42:06.192
That was selfish and stupid, and it won't happen again.

42:06.275 --> 42:09.361
Also, it's Christmastime and the rabbit's too big.

42:09.445 --> 42:11.447
Done. Sorry.

42:11.530 --> 42:14.533
And I'm sorry in advance

42:14.617 --> 42:16.577
because I can't come home yet.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.788
I need to find this guy.

42:19.872 --> 42:22.708
You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.

42:23.167 --> 42:26.128
I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.

42:50.361 --> 42:51.654
Let's get you comfy.

42:54.531 --> 42:56.367
You happy now?

43:06.710 --> 43:07.753
Freeze!

43:09.713 --> 43:11.340
Don't move.

43:12.007 --> 43:13.342
You got me.

43:14.927 --> 43:16.595
Nice potato gun.

43:17.179 --> 43:18.264
Barrel's a little long.

43:18.555 --> 43:22.268
Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS.

43:26.438 --> 43:27.690
And now you're out of ammo.

43:28.691 --> 43:30.234
What's that thing on your chest?

43:31.527 --> 43:33.445
It's an electromagnet.

43:33.529 --> 43:35.114
You should know, you got a box of them right here.

43:35.864 --> 43:37.032
What does it power?

43:46.041 --> 43:47.960
Oh, my God.

43:49.128 --> 43:50.254
That...

43:53.048 --> 43:54.675
That's... Is that Iron Man?

43:54.883 --> 43:56.302
Technically, I am.

43:56.927 --> 43:59.054
Technically, you're dead.

44:01.056 --> 44:02.099
Valid point.

44:02.391 --> 44:03.559
What happened to him?

44:03.642 --> 44:05.060
Life.

44:05.227 --> 44:07.730
I built him. I take care of him.

44:09.732 --> 44:10.733
I'll fix him.

44:10.816 --> 44:11.859
Like a mechanic?

44:11.942 --> 44:13.402
Yeah.

44:15.070 --> 44:17.823
If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...

44:17.906 --> 44:18.991
It's "Iron Patriot" now.

44:19.074 --> 44:20.242
That's way cooler.

44:20.326 --> 44:21.660
No, it's not.

44:21.744 --> 44:25.789
Anyways, I would have added in the retro...

44:25.998 --> 44:28.459
- Retro-reflective panels?  - To make him stealth mode.

44:28.751 --> 44:30.461
- You want a stealth mode?  - Cool, right?

44:30.627 --> 44:31.837
That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.006
- Not a good idea.  - Oops.

44:34.340 --> 44:36.425
What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger?

44:36.759 --> 44:38.052
He's in pain. He's been injured. Leave him alone.

44:38.177 --> 44:39.178
Sorry.

44:39.345 --> 44:40.763
Are you?

44:42.264 --> 44:44.558
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

44:44.641 --> 44:46.352
So, who's home?

44:46.435 --> 44:50.814
My mom already left for the diner, and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

44:51.774 --> 44:54.943
I guess he won, because that was six years ago.

44:56.862 --> 44:58.906
Which happens. Dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it.

44:58.989 --> 44:59.990
Here's what I need.

45:01.033 --> 45:03.535
A laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone,

45:03.619 --> 45:06.038
the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there,

45:06.121 --> 45:09.500
a map of town, a big spring and a tuna fish sandwich.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.710
What's in it for me?

45:11.794 --> 45:14.546
- Salvation. What's his name?  - Who?

45:14.797 --> 45:18.050
The kid that bullies you at school. What's his name?

45:18.133 --> 45:19.635
How'd you know that?

45:20.302 --> 45:21.970
I got just the thing.

45:24.306 --> 45:27.267
This is a pinata for a cricket.

45:27.351 --> 45:28.644
I'm kidding. This is a very powerful weapon.

45:29.144 --> 45:32.398
Point it away from your face, press the button on top,

45:32.481 --> 45:33.565
it discourages bullying.

45:34.483 --> 45:37.986
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. Deal?

45:38.320 --> 45:39.488
Deal? What do you say?

45:39.655 --> 45:41.407
- Deal?  - Deal.

45:42.866 --> 45:43.867
What's your name?

45:44.326 --> 45:46.495
Harley. And you're...

45:46.662 --> 45:47.955
The mechanic.

45:48.997 --> 45:50.249
Tony.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.211
You know what keeps going through my head?

45:54.294 --> 45:55.879
"Where's my sandwich?"

46:03.679 --> 46:06.181
Where is Tony Stark?

46:34.751 --> 46:38.255
Stark secure server. Retinal scan verified.

46:38.338 --> 46:39.465
Pepper, it's me.

46:39.548 --> 46:42.468
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time.

46:42.551 --> 46:45.596
So... First off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.

46:45.679 --> 46:48.056
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

46:50.476 --> 46:51.810
Why were you at the house tonight?

46:53.228 --> 46:55.397
What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?

46:59.234 --> 47:02.196
I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin.

47:03.655 --> 47:04.948
So, if you still want to talk about it

47:05.032 --> 47:08.118
I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.

47:09.411 --> 47:12.289
Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think?

47:12.498 --> 47:14.583
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

47:14.666 --> 47:17.419
That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder

47:17.503 --> 47:19.838
running a team of 40 out of a privately funded think tank.

47:19.922 --> 47:21.632
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

47:23.926 --> 47:26.053
This boss of yours, does he have a name?

47:26.553 --> 47:28.889
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

47:32.142 --> 47:34.478
We took the house down, Sir. But there's no sign of a body.

47:34.561 --> 47:35.604
- I see.  - No Stark.

47:36.063 --> 47:38.315
I have to go.

47:38.398 --> 47:40.651
The master is about to record and he's a little...

47:41.568 --> 47:43.320
Well, you know how he gets.

47:43.403 --> 47:46.949
Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.540
All right, everybody. No talking and no eye contact.

47:54.623 --> 47:56.917
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

48:08.637 --> 48:09.638
Report in.

48:11.682 --> 48:12.683
Path is clear.

48:17.729 --> 48:19.147
The master is travelling.

48:33.912 --> 48:37.040
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

48:39.293 --> 48:41.336
The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty,

48:41.420 --> 48:43.839
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.632
By the way, when you said your sister had a watch...

48:45.716 --> 48:46.800
- Yeah?  - l was kind of hoping

48:46.883 --> 48:49.219
for something a little more adult than that.

48:49.303 --> 48:52.931
She's six. Anyway, it's a limited edition.

48:53.015 --> 48:54.433
When can we talk about New York?

48:54.516 --> 48:56.393
Maybe never. Relax about it.

48:56.476 --> 48:57.936
What about the Avengers? Can we talk about them?

48:58.020 --> 49:00.230
I dunno. Later. Hey, kid, give me a little space.

49:04.359 --> 49:07.863
What's the official story here? What happened?

49:07.946 --> 49:12.492
I guess this guy named Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.

49:13.410 --> 49:15.996
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

49:16.079 --> 49:20.334
And one day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb.

49:20.959 --> 49:23.086
Then he blew himself up, right here.

49:29.343 --> 49:31.178
- Six people died, right?  - Yeah.

49:31.261 --> 49:33.013
- Including Chad Davis.  - Yeah, yeah.

49:39.144 --> 49:42.564
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

49:43.815 --> 49:44.900
Think about it.

49:45.442 --> 49:47.569
Six dead. Only five shadows.

49:47.861 --> 49:49.154
Yeah.

49:49.237 --> 49:52.074
People said these shadows are like the marks of souls going to heaven.

49:53.784 --> 49:55.535
Except the bomb guy.

49:55.619 --> 49:59.498
He went to hell, on account of he didn't get a shadow.

49:59.581 --> 50:00.999
That's why there's only five.

50:01.166 --> 50:04.044
- Do you buy that?  - It's what everyone says.

50:07.589 --> 50:09.800
You know what this crater reminds me of?

50:09.883 --> 50:12.344
No idea. I'm not... I don't care.

50:12.969 --> 50:18.058
That giant Wormhole in New York.

50:18.517 --> 50:20.560
Does it remind you?

50:20.644 --> 50:22.688
That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.

50:22.771 --> 50:24.731
Are they coming back? The aliens?

50:24.981 --> 50:26.108
Maybe. Can you stop?

50:27.859 --> 50:29.986
Remember what I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?

50:30.070 --> 50:31.863
Does this subject make you... edgy?

50:31.947 --> 50:34.199
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?

50:34.282 --> 50:36.118
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

50:36.201 --> 50:38.620
Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into?

50:38.870 --> 50:40.497
- Do you have medication?  - No.

50:40.664 --> 50:41.998
- Do you need to be on it?  - Probably.

50:42.165 --> 50:43.542
- Do you have PTSD?  - I don't think so.

50:43.625 --> 50:45.127
Are you... are you going completely mental?

50:45.836 --> 50:47.462
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

50:48.255 --> 50:49.464
Remember when I said to stop doing that?

50:49.548 --> 50:52.092
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

50:54.428 --> 50:56.513
Man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?

50:56.596 --> 50:57.639
What did I say?

50:58.181 --> 50:59.391
Hey! Wait up!

51:00.225 --> 51:02.269
Wait, wait.

51:07.149 --> 51:08.984
What the hell was that?

51:12.904 --> 51:15.157
Your fault. You spazzed me out.

51:16.825 --> 51:19.202
Okay, back to business. Where were we?

51:19.286 --> 51:20.495
The guy who died.

51:20.787 --> 51:23.707
Relatives? Mom? Mrs Davis, where is she?

51:23.790 --> 51:24.833
Where she always is.

51:25.667 --> 51:27.544
See? Now, you're being helpful.

51:32.758 --> 51:34.050
Sorry.

51:34.134 --> 51:35.594
Lady?

51:36.553 --> 51:38.513
Is this...

51:39.556 --> 51:40.557
Thank you.

51:43.101 --> 51:45.687
Nice haircut. it suits you.

51:46.229 --> 51:47.230
Nice watch.

51:47.481 --> 51:48.940
Yeah. A limited edition.

51:49.483 --> 51:51.526
I don't doubt it.

51:52.569 --> 51:53.820
Well, have a good evening.

52:17.219 --> 52:18.887
Mrs Davis?

52:19.638 --> 52:20.639
Mind if I join you?

52:21.515 --> 52:22.516
Free country.

52:23.016 --> 52:24.476
Sure is.

52:29.064 --> 52:30.607
All right.

52:31.566 --> 52:33.568
Where would you like to start?

52:33.902 --> 52:37.113
I just want to say, I'm sorry about your loss.

52:37.197 --> 52:38.657
I want to know what you think happened.

52:40.826 --> 52:45.747
Look, I brought your damn file. You take it, go.

52:46.748 --> 52:50.502
Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.

52:51.628 --> 52:54.464
Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Huh?

52:54.589 --> 52:55.757
Supposed to meet someone here?

52:55.882 --> 52:56.883
Yeah.

53:10.772 --> 53:13.149
Mrs Davis, your son didn't kill himself.

53:13.233 --> 53:15.110
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

53:16.820 --> 53:17.946
Someone used him.

53:19.281 --> 53:20.282
What?

53:20.949 --> 53:22.868
As a weapon.

53:26.621 --> 53:30.375
You're not the person that called me after all, are you?

53:31.084 --> 53:32.294
Actually, I am.

53:36.339 --> 53:39.634
Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell is going on here?

53:40.093 --> 53:41.720
It's called an arrest.

53:43.179 --> 53:45.807
- Sheriff, is it?  - Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

53:45.891 --> 53:47.934
Homeland Security. We good here?

53:48.018 --> 53:49.853
No, we're not "good."

53:49.936 --> 53:51.438
I need a little more information than that.

53:51.730 --> 53:53.899
I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

53:54.190 --> 53:57.444
Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn to Nashville, and upgrade me?

53:57.736 --> 54:01.323
All right. You know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way

54:01.907 --> 54:03.158
but the fun way is always good.

54:04.576 --> 54:06.036
Deputy, get this woman out of...

54:19.591 --> 54:22.093
Hey, hot wings, you want to party? Come on, you and me, let's go.

54:35.899 --> 54:37.859
- Crazy, huh?  - Yep.

54:39.361 --> 54:40.403
Watch this.

55:46.594 --> 55:50.390
You walked right into this one. I've dated hotter chicks than you.

55:51.766 --> 55:52.767
That's all you got?

55:54.269 --> 55:55.687
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

55:55.770 --> 55:59.149
Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.961
- Let me go!  - Help me!

57:06.216 --> 57:07.342
Anyway...

57:08.468 --> 57:10.595
Hey, kid, what would you like for Christmas?

57:10.678 --> 57:12.639
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.

57:12.722 --> 57:13.932
No, no, no. I think he was trying to say,

57:14.015 --> 57:15.934
"I want my goddamn file."

57:16.351 --> 57:17.393
It's not your fault, kid.

57:20.355 --> 57:21.898
Remember what I told you about bullies?

57:28.446 --> 57:29.572
You like that, Westworld?

57:30.073 --> 57:31.407
That's the thing about smart guys,

57:32.200 --> 57:33.993
we always cover our ass.

57:58.309 --> 58:00.103
You're welcome.

58:01.437 --> 58:02.772
For what? Did I miss something?

58:02.856 --> 58:04.816
Me, saving your life.

58:04.899 --> 58:08.027
Yeah. A, I saved you first. B, thanks. Sort of.

58:08.111 --> 58:10.864
And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz.

58:10.947 --> 58:14.242
All right? Just play it cool. Otherwise you come off grandiose.

58:14.325 --> 58:16.119
Unlike you?

58:17.704 --> 58:19.581
Admit it, you need me.

58:19.914 --> 58:21.207
We're connected.

58:21.416 --> 58:23.334
What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom,

58:23.543 --> 58:25.837
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

58:25.920 --> 58:27.172
and stay connected to the telephone,

58:27.255 --> 58:28.965
because if I call, you better pick up. Okay?

58:29.549 --> 58:32.177
Can you feel that? We're done here.

58:32.260 --> 58:33.511
Move out of the way, or I'm gonna run you over.

58:33.928 --> 58:35.305
Bye, kid.

58:41.895 --> 58:43.396
I'm sorry, kid.

58:44.105 --> 58:45.106
You did good.

58:45.607 --> 58:48.067
So, now you're just gonna leave me here, like my dad?

58:50.195 --> 58:51.196
Yeah.

58:52.739 --> 58:54.032
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me, aren't you?

58:54.282 --> 58:55.742
I'm cold.

58:56.034 --> 58:58.286
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

58:59.746 --> 59:01.289
Because we're connected.

59:05.043 --> 59:07.212
It was worth a shot.

59:20.058 --> 59:21.976
You get this. It's affordable. It's gorgeous.

59:22.060 --> 59:23.436
It goes with any decor...

59:25.313 --> 59:27.649
- What happened to picture?  - Go to override.

59:29.150 --> 59:31.736
- How is this happening again?  - Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

59:31.819 --> 59:32.820
I'm trying. There's nothing I can...

59:32.904 --> 59:33.905
Well, where is the feed coming from?

59:34.155 --> 59:36.074
I don't know, it's in all of our receivers and I...

59:36.157 --> 59:38.284
The entire East Coast, the satellites are down.

59:38.368 --> 59:39.702
It's not just our station.

59:39.786 --> 59:40.870
What about a backup manual?

59:41.037 --> 59:42.997
We have an unauthorised broadcast cutting through...

59:43.206 --> 59:47.043
Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.

59:48.878 --> 59:50.505
Oh, God, not again.

59:51.130 --> 59:52.340
Is the President getting this?

1:00:03.434 --> 1:00:05.186
Mr President.

1:00:05.603 --> 1:00:07.438
Only two lessons remain.

1:00:08.147 --> 1:00:11.567
And I intend to finish this before Christmas morning.

1:00:12.026 --> 1:00:14.404
Meet Thomas Richards.

1:00:14.487 --> 1:00:17.657
Good strong name. Good strong job.

1:00:18.241 --> 1:00:23.538
Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

1:00:26.124 --> 1:00:28.543
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

1:00:30.878 --> 1:00:32.046
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

1:00:32.714 --> 1:00:35.633
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

1:00:35.717 --> 1:00:36.843
No!

1:00:36.926 --> 1:00:40.305
The number for this telephone is in your cell phone.

1:00:40.388 --> 1:00:43.516
Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there?

1:00:43.725 --> 1:00:45.351
America,

1:00:45.643 --> 1:00:48.563
if your president calls me in the next half-minute,

1:00:48.938 --> 1:00:50.356
Tom lives.

1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:51.441
Go!

1:00:53.735 --> 1:00:55.028
How did he hack my phone?

1:00:55.111 --> 1:00:57.071
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

1:00:57.155 --> 1:00:58.406
I have to make this call.

1:00:58.573 --> 1:00:59.866
I'd strongly advise against that.

1:00:59.949 --> 1:01:02.577
This is the right thing to do.

1:01:29.103 --> 1:01:31.564
There's just one lesson left, President Ellis.

1:01:31.647 --> 1:01:33.524
So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye.

1:01:33.608 --> 1:01:34.609
Because nothing,

1:01:34.692 --> 1:01:37.111
not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog,

1:01:37.195 --> 1:01:39.197
can save you.

1:01:41.574 --> 1:01:43.659
I'll see you soon.

1:01:45.745 --> 1:01:49.123
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.

1:01:49.207 --> 1:01:50.917
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:52.835
We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan

1:01:52.919 --> 1:01:54.045
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

1:01:54.128 --> 1:01:56.297
- Right now.  - Yes, sir.

1:02:09.227 --> 1:02:12.146
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy...

1:02:26.577 --> 1:02:28.204
Don't move!

1:02:34.502 --> 1:02:35.503
Hang on a second.

1:02:36.379 --> 1:02:37.380
Hello?

1:02:37.547 --> 1:02:39.215
You ever have a chick straddling you, and you look up

1:02:39.298 --> 1:02:43.136
and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

1:02:43.428 --> 1:02:44.720
Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:45.763
It's me, pal.

1:02:45.847 --> 1:02:47.932
Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly,

1:02:48.015 --> 1:02:50.017
you came looking for me. What are you doing?

1:02:50.101 --> 1:02:51.477
A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan.

1:02:51.561 --> 1:02:52.562
What are you doing?

1:02:52.937 --> 1:02:55.773
Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?

1:02:55.857 --> 1:02:56.858
Yeah.

1:02:58.568 --> 1:03:00.820
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat now, I need your login.

1:03:01.112 --> 1:03:03.156
It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."

1:03:03.322 --> 1:03:04.282
And password, please.

1:03:04.365 --> 1:03:06.409
Look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.

1:03:06.576 --> 1:03:08.828
It's not the 80s, nobody says "hack" any more.

1:03:08.911 --> 1:03:09.912
Give me your login.

1:03:11.539 --> 1:03:13.958
"WAR MACHINE ROX" with an "X," all caps.

1:03:17.670 --> 1:03:18.671
Yeah, okay.

1:03:18.963 --> 1:03:22.008
That is so much better than "Iron Patriot."

1:03:30.057 --> 1:03:31.684
Very nice. Very nice.

1:03:31.976 --> 1:03:34.479
I have one question for you.

1:03:34.604 --> 1:03:37.106
What would you like for Christmas this year?

1:03:38.858 --> 1:03:40.234
Well, David...

1:03:42.487 --> 1:03:47.116
Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

1:03:52.079 --> 1:03:54.499
One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.

1:03:56.542 --> 1:03:59.212
Because you erase my shows!

1:04:03.508 --> 1:04:05.009
That ain't gonna cut it.

1:04:05.259 --> 1:04:07.220
We talked about this.

1:04:08.679 --> 1:04:10.806
Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...

1:04:13.726 --> 1:04:15.937
Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening.

1:04:17.146 --> 1:04:19.065
- Tony Stark is in my van.  - Keep it down.

1:04:19.148 --> 1:04:20.691
- Tony Stark is in my van!  - No, he's not.

1:04:20.816 --> 1:04:21.817
I knew you were still alive!

1:04:22.443 --> 1:04:23.569
Come on in. Close the door.

1:04:28.533 --> 1:04:29.742
Wow. Can I just say, sir...

1:04:29.825 --> 1:04:30.952
Yep.

1:04:31.744 --> 1:04:32.912
I am your biggest fan.

1:04:33.079 --> 1:04:34.956
First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?

1:04:35.248 --> 1:04:36.290
No, no, no. Just us.

1:04:36.374 --> 1:04:37.458
Great. What's your name?

1:04:37.542 --> 1:04:39.126
- Gary.  - Gary.

1:04:40.670 --> 1:04:42.255
- Wow.  - Right there is fine.

1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:43.548
- Okay.  - Okay?

1:04:43.631 --> 1:04:44.757
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1:04:45.174 --> 1:04:47.176
- Good. Can I just say?  - What do you want? Yeah.

1:04:47.969 --> 1:04:50.680
I don't know if you can tell,

1:04:50.763 --> 1:04:52.890
but I have patterned my whole look after you.

1:04:52.974 --> 1:04:54.350
- My hair's a little...  - it's fine.

1:04:54.433 --> 1:04:55.977
It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.

1:04:56.143 --> 1:04:57.853
Right.

1:04:58.104 --> 1:05:01.983
I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you...

1:05:02.233 --> 1:05:03.442
Boom!

1:05:03.985 --> 1:05:06.654
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1:05:06.737 --> 1:05:09.448
- I'm sorry. Is that me?  - Yeah. It's... I mean...

1:05:09.532 --> 1:05:14.287
I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture.

1:05:14.870 --> 1:05:17.832
- So it's a little bit...  - Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1:05:17.915 --> 1:05:21.836
I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited.

1:05:21.919 --> 1:05:23.838
I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.

1:05:23.921 --> 1:05:26.632
I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files.

1:05:26.716 --> 1:05:27.842
I don't have enough juice.

1:05:28.134 --> 1:05:30.261
I need you to jump on the roof... right?

1:05:30.344 --> 1:05:32.555
Recalibrate the ISDNs.

1:05:32.638 --> 1:05:34.682
Pump it up by about 40%.

1:05:35.141 --> 1:05:36.267
- Got it.  - All right? It's a mission.

1:05:36.350 --> 1:05:37.351
Yeah.

1:05:37.435 --> 1:05:39.437
Tony needs Gary.

1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:40.688
And Gary needs Tony.

1:05:40.771 --> 1:05:42.106
- Be quiet about it. Go.  - Yeah.

1:06:05.463 --> 1:06:09.175
What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?

1:06:09.383 --> 1:06:12.136
I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me.

1:06:14.805 --> 1:06:16.474
Will you please state your name for the camera?

1:06:16.557 --> 1:06:17.808
Ellen Brandt.

1:06:18.225 --> 1:06:22.229
Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically.

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:23.731
Addiction will not be tolerated.

1:06:23.814 --> 1:06:26.776
Those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme.

1:06:28.152 --> 1:06:30.988
Once misfits, cripples...

1:06:31.656 --> 1:06:34.742
You are the next iteration of human evolution.

1:06:39.413 --> 1:06:40.915
Everybody, before we start...

1:06:41.165 --> 1:06:44.210
I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter

1:06:44.293 --> 1:06:48.422
as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego.

1:06:48.506 --> 1:06:50.174
Today is your glory...

1:06:50.257 --> 1:06:51.342
Let's begin.

1:07:02.645 --> 1:07:03.938
We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here!

1:07:04.105 --> 1:07:05.189
Get her out! Get them out of here!

1:07:12.446 --> 1:07:15.282
A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.

1:07:17.243 --> 1:07:19.995
The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal?

1:07:20.079 --> 1:07:22.289
It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1:07:22.373 --> 1:07:24.709
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1:07:25.292 --> 1:07:27.545
Got you, pal.

1:07:29.797 --> 1:07:31.632
What happened?

1:07:32.341 --> 1:07:34.301
Fun fact.

1:07:34.385 --> 1:07:37.513
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1:07:38.013 --> 1:07:42.017
the idealistic Wernher Von Braun

1:07:42.309 --> 1:07:44.311
dreamed of space travel.

1:07:45.604 --> 1:07:47.440
He stargazed.

1:07:47.815 --> 1:07:51.277
Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London?

1:07:52.278 --> 1:07:55.740
"The rocket performed perfectly."

1:07:57.658 --> 1:08:00.327
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1:08:01.203 --> 1:08:06.000
See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science.

1:08:06.625 --> 1:08:11.630
And then the ego steps in, the obsession.

1:08:12.715 --> 1:08:14.967
And you look up,

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:19.305
you're a long way from shore.

1:08:19.472 --> 1:08:22.391
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya.

1:08:23.017 --> 1:08:25.561
I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.

1:08:25.644 --> 1:08:29.190
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.

1:08:29.482 --> 1:08:31.817
That's exactly what we used to do.

1:08:32.067 --> 1:08:34.111
So, don't judge yourself.

1:08:35.571 --> 1:08:37.615
Thank you, Pepper.

1:08:38.824 --> 1:08:40.618
I really appreciate that.

1:08:48.292 --> 1:08:50.586
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.  - Good evening.

1:08:52.379 --> 1:08:53.756
Maya, run!

1:08:56.258 --> 1:08:57.593
Hi, Pepper.

1:08:59.261 --> 1:09:01.388
So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?

1:09:01.806 --> 1:09:02.807
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1:09:02.890 --> 1:09:05.184
I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.

1:09:05.267 --> 1:09:08.646
I see. So, you were trying to save Stark, when he threatened us?

1:09:08.729 --> 1:09:10.606
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1:09:12.691 --> 1:09:14.693
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1:09:14.777 --> 1:09:17.738
Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark.

1:09:17.822 --> 1:09:21.367
He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.

1:09:26.205 --> 1:09:27.915
This is support team Blue-Zero.

1:09:27.998 --> 1:09:30.668
Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

1:09:30.751 --> 1:09:31.794
Copy...

1:09:39.927 --> 1:09:41.095
Nobody move.

1:09:46.183 --> 1:09:47.268
Support Blue-Zero,

1:09:47.434 --> 1:09:49.270
unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S.

1:09:49.353 --> 1:09:50.938
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1:09:51.188 --> 1:09:53.440
I think you messed up again.

1:09:53.524 --> 1:09:56.360
Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.

1:09:56.652 --> 1:09:57.695
It's... Of course.

1:09:57.778 --> 1:09:58.779
Yes, ma'am.

1:09:58.946 --> 1:09:59.989
Iron Patriot on the job.

1:10:00.155 --> 1:10:01.156
Happy to help.

1:10:01.365 --> 1:10:02.449
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1:10:02.616 --> 1:10:03.826
It's my pleasure.

1:10:11.959 --> 1:10:14.211
Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.

1:10:14.295 --> 1:10:15.546
If you want this suit,

1:10:15.713 --> 1:10:17.965
you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.

1:10:18.299 --> 1:10:19.758
That's the plan, Colonel.

1:10:21.343 --> 1:10:23.929
Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.

1:10:24.013 --> 1:10:27.308
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?

1:10:27.641 --> 1:10:29.226
- How much have you had?  - Two or three bowls.

1:10:29.518 --> 1:10:32.313
- Can you still see straight?  - Sort of.

1:10:32.396 --> 1:10:33.480
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis.

1:10:34.398 --> 1:10:35.399
Jarvis, how are we?

1:10:35.482 --> 1:10:37.735
It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch,

1:10:37.818 --> 1:10:40.863
and then at the end of the sentence, I say the wrong cranberry.

1:10:40.946 --> 1:10:42.239
And, sir, you were right.

1:10:42.323 --> 1:10:44.992
Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities

1:10:45.326 --> 1:10:47.494
I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

1:10:47.828 --> 1:10:49.914
What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa...

1:10:49.997 --> 1:10:51.957
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

1:10:52.166 --> 1:10:53.459
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

1:10:53.918 --> 1:10:56.420
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through

1:10:56.503 --> 1:10:57.880
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1:10:57.963 --> 1:10:59.381
but not right now.

1:10:59.465 --> 1:11:00.466
Harley, where is he really?

1:11:00.716 --> 1:11:02.051
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.

1:11:04.219 --> 1:11:06.221
It does say Miami, Florida.

1:11:06.305 --> 1:11:09.266
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?

1:11:09.558 --> 1:11:10.768
It's not charging.

1:11:18.192 --> 1:11:21.320
Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable.

1:11:21.528 --> 1:11:23.822
It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.

1:11:24.031 --> 1:11:25.824
What's questionable about electricity? All right?

1:11:25.908 --> 1:11:29.787
It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna? I don't wanna...

1:11:30.579 --> 1:11:31.830
Oh, God, not again.

1:11:32.039 --> 1:11:33.624
Tony?

1:11:35.751 --> 1:11:37.586
Are you having another attack?

1:11:37.753 --> 1:11:38.963
I didn't even mention New York.

1:11:39.046 --> 1:11:42.508
Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.

1:11:42.925 --> 1:11:44.385
Okay...

1:11:46.679 --> 1:11:47.680
God, what am I gonna do?

1:11:47.972 --> 1:11:51.308
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1:11:51.809 --> 1:11:54.228
You're a mechanic, right?

1:11:54.395 --> 1:11:55.771
Right.

1:11:56.563 --> 1:11:57.940
You said so.

1:11:58.899 --> 1:12:00.401
Yes, I did.

1:12:00.734 --> 1:12:03.404
Why don't you just build something?

1:12:15.416 --> 1:12:16.458
Okay.

1:12:17.501 --> 1:12:18.502
Thanks, kid.

1:14:02.272 --> 1:14:07.277
Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.

1:14:07.361 --> 1:14:08.695
My fault again.

1:14:08.779 --> 1:14:11.532
Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con...

1:15:11.884 --> 1:15:12.968
Well.

1:15:14.511 --> 1:15:16.805
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1:15:18.056 --> 1:15:20.392
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1:15:20.475 --> 1:15:21.768
That's me.

1:15:22.352 --> 1:15:23.395
Nessie.

1:15:23.729 --> 1:15:28.567
Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?

1:15:28.734 --> 1:15:30.152
There's some guy over here.

1:15:30.235 --> 1:15:33.447
They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.

1:15:33.697 --> 1:15:34.740
Hey!

1:15:36.825 --> 1:15:37.868
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1:15:38.452 --> 1:15:39.494
Don't move.

1:15:39.578 --> 1:15:41.705
I'm not moving. You want something? Take it.

1:15:41.788 --> 1:15:42.789
Although the guns are all fake

1:15:42.873 --> 1:15:44.708
because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1:15:44.791 --> 1:15:47.044
- What?  - Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1:15:49.046 --> 1:15:50.297
Heard enough.

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:52.466
You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy.

1:15:52.633 --> 1:15:53.675
Where?

1:15:53.759 --> 1:15:55.928
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

1:15:56.428 --> 1:15:58.972
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.

1:15:59.056 --> 1:16:00.641
- He's here, but he's not here.  - What do you mean?

1:16:01.058 --> 1:16:02.809
It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.

1:16:03.101 --> 1:16:04.645
- It is.  - It's complicated.

1:16:04.853 --> 1:16:06.063
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.

1:16:06.146 --> 1:16:07.189
Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom.

1:16:10.442 --> 1:16:11.652
Sit.

1:16:12.653 --> 1:16:13.779
Oh, Jesus.

1:16:20.869 --> 1:16:23.956
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1:16:24.039 --> 1:16:25.082
What are you?

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:27.793
A decoy? You're a double, right?

1:16:28.085 --> 1:16:30.963
You mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.

1:16:31.046 --> 1:16:33.840
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

1:16:34.549 --> 1:16:36.718
You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.

1:16:36.802 --> 1:16:40.764
It's just a role. "The Mandarin," it's not real.

1:16:41.139 --> 1:16:43.225
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1:16:45.185 --> 1:16:51.358
Well, I had a little problem with substances.

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:55.696
And I ended up doing things, no two ways about it,

1:16:55.779 --> 1:16:58.073
in the street, that a man shouldn't do.

1:16:58.240 --> 1:16:59.700
- Next?  - Then,

1:16:59.783 --> 1:17:02.661
they approached me about the role,

1:17:02.744 --> 1:17:04.162
and they knew about the drugs.

1:17:04.246 --> 1:17:05.414
What did they say? They'd get you off them?

1:17:05.747 --> 1:17:07.207
They said they'd give me more.

1:17:07.291 --> 1:17:08.333
They gave me things.

1:17:08.417 --> 1:17:11.920
They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery.

1:17:12.004 --> 1:17:14.256
They gave me things.

1:17:15.424 --> 1:17:16.550
Did you just nod off?

1:17:16.717 --> 1:17:17.718
Hey.

1:17:17.801 --> 1:17:19.636
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:22.139
And the thing was, he needed someone

1:17:22.222 --> 1:17:26.143
to take credit for some accidental explosions.

1:17:29.563 --> 1:17:30.564
"He"?

1:17:33.191 --> 1:17:35.152
- Killian?  - Killian.

1:17:35.235 --> 1:17:38.071
- He created you?  - He created me.

1:17:38.780 --> 1:17:39.781
Custom-made terror threat.

1:17:40.324 --> 1:17:42.075
Yes. Yes.

1:17:42.284 --> 1:17:44.036
His think tank thinked it up.

1:17:44.578 --> 1:17:46.747
The pathology of a serial killer.

1:17:46.955 --> 1:17:49.833
The manipulation of Western iconography.

1:17:50.334 --> 1:17:53.420
Ready for another lesson?

1:17:53.670 --> 1:17:54.963
Blah, blah, blah.

1:17:55.255 --> 1:17:56.506
No.

1:17:56.590 --> 1:17:59.551
Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.

1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:01.178
Your performance?

1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:03.180
Where people died?

1:18:03.263 --> 1:18:04.973
No, they didn't.

1:18:05.682 --> 1:18:08.977
Look around you. The costumes, green screen.

1:18:09.061 --> 1:18:11.188
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1:18:11.271 --> 1:18:13.065
And when I was, it was movie magic, love.

1:18:13.357 --> 1:18:15.317
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:16.568
and he might not wake up.

1:18:16.902 --> 1:18:17.986
So you're gonna have to answer for that.

1:18:18.070 --> 1:18:19.571
You're still going down, pal.

1:18:19.654 --> 1:18:20.655
You under...

1:18:27.245 --> 1:18:30.248
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1:18:30.582 --> 1:18:32.834
- I didn't tell him anything.  - Nothing?

1:18:33.752 --> 1:18:34.836
No.

1:18:35.128 --> 1:18:36.421
You should have pressed the panic button.

1:18:37.297 --> 1:18:39.633
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1:18:52.312 --> 1:18:53.397
Okay.

1:19:02.364 --> 1:19:03.990
It's just like old times, huh?

1:19:04.366 --> 1:19:07.077
Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:08.787
It wasn't my idea.

1:19:08.870 --> 1:19:10.872
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1:19:11.039 --> 1:19:12.040
I took his money.

1:19:12.332 --> 1:19:14.501
And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.

1:19:14.668 --> 1:19:16.420
- No.  - Yeah.

1:19:16.503 --> 1:19:18.171
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.

1:19:18.797 --> 1:19:20.090
Yeah?

1:19:23.969 --> 1:19:25.470
A lot has happened, Tony.

1:19:26.430 --> 1:19:27.889
But I'm close.

1:19:28.557 --> 1:19:30.684
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

1:19:30.767 --> 1:19:32.936
I'm telling you it isn't. I'm on the street.

1:19:33.019 --> 1:19:34.438
People are going bang. They're painting the walls.

1:19:34.521 --> 1:19:35.856
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1:19:35.939 --> 1:19:37.190
Then help me fix it.

1:19:42.571 --> 1:19:43.864
Did I do that?

1:19:45.198 --> 1:19:46.199
Yes.

1:19:46.533 --> 1:19:47.909
I remember the night, not the morning.

1:19:48.910 --> 1:19:50.203
Is this what you've been chasing around?

1:19:50.287 --> 1:19:52.372
- You don't remember?  - I can't help you.

1:19:53.373 --> 1:19:56.960
You used to have a moral psychology.

1:19:57.043 --> 1:19:59.212
You used to have ideals.

1:19:59.629 --> 1:20:01.965
You wanted to help people.

1:20:02.048 --> 1:20:03.925
Now look at you.

1:20:04.968 --> 1:20:06.928
I get to wake up every morning with someone who

1:20:10.223 --> 1:20:11.766
still has their soul.

1:20:17.439 --> 1:20:18.440
Get me out of here.

1:20:21.443 --> 1:20:22.903
Come on.

1:20:24.070 --> 1:20:25.489
You know what my old man used to say to me?

1:20:26.781 --> 1:20:29.868
One of his favourite of many sayings...

1:20:29.951 --> 1:20:34.331
"The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."

1:20:34.539 --> 1:20:36.666
You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1:20:36.750 --> 1:20:39.169
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1:20:39.252 --> 1:20:41.254
I'm here to thank you.

1:20:41.421 --> 1:20:43.632
You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me.

1:20:44.424 --> 1:20:45.884
Desperation.

1:20:46.426 --> 1:20:48.094
If you think back to Switzerland,

1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:51.181
you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?

1:20:51.264 --> 1:20:54.142
For the first 20 minutes,

1:20:54.601 --> 1:20:56.561
I actually thought you'd show up.

1:20:56.645 --> 1:20:58.438
And the next hour...

1:21:00.023 --> 1:21:04.444
I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1:21:04.736 --> 1:21:05.737
If you know what I mean.

1:21:06.112 --> 1:21:09.115
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.

1:21:09.616 --> 1:21:11.868
But as I looked out over that city,

1:21:12.118 --> 1:21:14.788
nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me,

1:21:14.871 --> 1:21:17.123
no one was even looking.

1:21:17.207 --> 1:21:21.211
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.

1:21:21.795 --> 1:21:23.004
Anonymity, Tony.

1:21:24.673 --> 1:21:26.299
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since.

1:21:26.550 --> 1:21:27.634
Right?

1:21:27.717 --> 1:21:30.136
You simply rule from behind the scenes.

1:21:30.220 --> 1:21:32.681
Because the second you give evil a face,

1:21:32.889 --> 1:21:35.725
a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,

1:21:35.809 --> 1:21:37.394
you hand the people a target.

1:21:37.686 --> 1:21:39.145
You're something else.

1:21:41.398 --> 1:21:42.482
You have met him, I assume?

1:21:42.566 --> 1:21:44.150
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1:21:44.234 --> 1:21:46.570
I know he's a little over the top sometimes.

1:21:46.653 --> 1:21:48.363
It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden...

1:21:48.446 --> 1:21:49.489
He's a stage actor.

1:21:50.490 --> 1:21:53.577
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1:21:53.660 --> 1:21:55.704
Anyway, the point is,

1:21:55.787 --> 1:21:59.124
ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1:21:59.207 --> 1:22:00.500
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1:22:01.167 --> 1:22:02.752
What's next for you in your world?

1:22:02.836 --> 1:22:07.966
I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me.

1:22:14.764 --> 1:22:15.765
Desperation.

1:22:16.725 --> 1:22:17.767
Now, this is live.

1:22:18.059 --> 1:22:21.062
I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment

1:22:21.146 --> 1:22:25.609
the body is trying to decide whether to accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.

1:22:25.817 --> 1:22:27.527
And if it gives up,

1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:32.532
I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular.

1:22:33.491 --> 1:22:36.911
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.

1:22:38.705 --> 1:22:41.625
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1:22:41.875 --> 1:22:44.210
What kind of perk package are you thinking of?

1:22:45.086 --> 1:22:46.087
Let him go.

1:22:47.380 --> 1:22:48.381
Hold on, hold on.

1:22:49.341 --> 1:22:50.383
Maya...

1:22:50.592 --> 1:22:52.427
I said, let him go.

1:22:53.178 --> 1:22:54.596
What are you doing?

1:22:54.679 --> 1:22:57.390
1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1:22:58.266 --> 1:23:02.479
It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat.

1:23:02.562 --> 1:23:03.897
Maya, give me the injector.

1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:06.441
If I die, Killian,

1:23:06.524 --> 1:23:09.611
what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?

1:23:09.694 --> 1:23:10.904
We're not doing this, okay?

1:23:11.112 --> 1:23:14.324
What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?

1:23:26.252 --> 1:23:27.295
The good news is,

1:23:28.630 --> 1:23:30.882
a high-level position has just been vacated.

1:23:40.266 --> 1:23:41.559
You are a maniac.

1:23:41.643 --> 1:23:43.812
No, I'm a visionary.

1:23:44.145 --> 1:23:46.356
But I do own a maniac.

1:23:46.439 --> 1:23:49.401
And he takes the stage tonight.

1:23:53.113 --> 1:23:54.197
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:57.242
it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1:23:57.325 --> 1:23:59.953
That's great, but the last time I looked, there was somebody inside of it.

1:24:06.167 --> 1:24:07.419
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1:24:11.089 --> 1:24:12.590
Hello, Colonel.

1:24:13.550 --> 1:24:14.926
Step aside.

1:24:23.351 --> 1:24:25.103
We'll get you out of there.

1:24:25.186 --> 1:24:26.312
Don't worry.

1:24:27.021 --> 1:24:28.773
You'll damage the armour.

1:24:28.982 --> 1:24:30.400
Yes, I will.

1:24:30.984 --> 1:24:32.152
But you can fix it, right?

1:24:33.611 --> 1:24:35.739
I'm gonna take the suit to base camp.

1:24:35.822 --> 1:24:37.323
And I want Potts with me.

1:24:37.407 --> 1:24:38.408
She's still in Phase Two.

1:24:40.452 --> 1:24:41.494
You're not going deaf, are you?

1:24:58.178 --> 1:25:00.680
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.

1:25:01.097 --> 1:25:02.140
Hey, Ponytail Express.

1:25:03.475 --> 1:25:05.310
What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?

1:25:05.518 --> 1:25:06.519
832 miles.

1:25:06.811 --> 1:25:08.104
Very nice.

1:25:08.188 --> 1:25:09.522
I'm good like that.

1:25:10.148 --> 1:25:11.608
Can you stop that?

1:25:11.775 --> 1:25:13.234
Break it, you bought it.

1:25:15.612 --> 1:25:16.613
I think I bought it.

1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:19.157
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister.

1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:21.659
And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.

1:25:22.577 --> 1:25:23.828
- What are you gonna do to me?  - You'll see.

1:25:24.078 --> 1:25:25.538
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1:25:26.372 --> 1:25:27.874
This.

1:25:30.919 --> 1:25:31.961
That.

1:25:36.716 --> 1:25:38.343
Are you coming out?

1:25:41.095 --> 1:25:43.389
Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open.

1:25:43.473 --> 1:25:44.474
All right. Let's go.

1:25:52.565 --> 1:25:54.859
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1:25:59.405 --> 1:26:02.116
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.160
This time tomorrow,

1:26:04.244 --> 1:26:07.831
I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand,

1:26:07.914 --> 1:26:11.668
and the world's most feared terrorist in the other.

1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:14.921
I'll own the war on terror.

1:26:15.547 --> 1:26:16.965
Create supply and demand.

1:26:17.549 --> 1:26:21.386
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1:26:23.638 --> 1:26:25.682
Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1:26:25.765 --> 1:26:28.184
on the ground in five, four, three...

1:26:28.268 --> 1:26:29.561
Come on! Two...

1:26:31.271 --> 1:26:32.605
How did we get this shift?

1:26:32.772 --> 1:26:34.148
All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1:26:34.607 --> 1:26:36.025
Put down your weapons.

1:26:36.109 --> 1:26:38.486
Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live.

1:26:38.570 --> 1:26:40.947
In five, four, bang!

1:26:41.114 --> 1:26:42.115
Wow.

1:26:42.323 --> 1:26:44.033
You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.

1:26:44.158 --> 1:26:45.660
I am just beyond terrified.

1:26:45.827 --> 1:26:47.245
Here it comes.

1:26:47.579 --> 1:26:49.664
- Three, four...  - Shut up.

1:26:49.998 --> 1:26:51.499
Five, four, three, two, one!

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:54.002
Told you.

1:27:05.722 --> 1:27:06.723
Where's the rest?

1:28:05.865 --> 1:28:08.576
Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.

1:28:14.540 --> 1:28:16.334
Better late than never.

1:28:22.048 --> 1:28:24.258
Not this time. Not the face.

1:28:25.718 --> 1:28:27.637
It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.

1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:29.055
Hello, sir.

1:28:34.268 --> 1:28:36.646
All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.

1:28:37.021 --> 1:28:39.607
Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.

1:28:39.691 --> 1:28:40.900
Let's go!

1:28:41.317 --> 1:28:42.568
Crap.

1:28:55.373 --> 1:28:56.374
Tony?

1:28:56.582 --> 1:28:57.750
Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.

1:28:57.917 --> 1:28:59.919
No. You got yours?

1:29:00.253 --> 1:29:02.130
Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can.

1:29:02.505 --> 1:29:04.007
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

1:29:08.928 --> 1:29:11.556
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1:29:11.764 --> 1:29:14.142
The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1:29:14.225 --> 1:29:15.435
What's this? I had winners.

1:29:23.651 --> 1:29:24.777
What have you come as?

1:29:25.111 --> 1:29:27.280
You make a move, and I break your face.

1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:32.243
I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.

1:29:32.660 --> 1:29:33.703
This is the Mandarin?

1:29:33.870 --> 1:29:35.788
Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.665
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1:29:37.999 --> 1:29:40.877
I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:44.714
But, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1:29:44.797 --> 1:29:46.257
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:48.468
You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.

1:29:48.634 --> 1:29:50.094
Doing what?

1:29:50.178 --> 1:29:52.346
I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!

1:29:52.889 --> 1:29:56.142
I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.

1:29:56.434 --> 1:29:58.394
- Spill.  - Do you know what they did to my suit?

1:29:58.478 --> 1:29:59.520
What? No.

1:29:59.979 --> 1:30:02.065
But I do know it's happening off the coast.

1:30:02.148 --> 1:30:05.568
Something to do with a big boat.

1:30:05.651 --> 1:30:06.986
I can take you there.

1:30:07.653 --> 1:30:09.530
Ole', ole', ole', ole'...

1:30:09.614 --> 1:30:12.617
Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.

1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:16.662
And this next bit may include the vice president as well.

1:30:17.330 --> 1:30:18.414
Is that... Is that important?

1:30:18.664 --> 1:30:20.291
- Somewhat.  - Yeah, a little bit.

1:30:23.127 --> 1:30:24.128
So?

1:30:24.670 --> 1:30:26.047
What are we gonna do?

1:30:26.130 --> 1:30:27.215
We don't have any transport.

1:30:27.298 --> 1:30:28.299
Right.

1:30:30.176 --> 1:30:31.302
Hey, Ringo.

1:30:31.385 --> 1:30:34.013
Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"?

1:30:36.224 --> 1:30:38.726
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1:30:38.893 --> 1:30:39.936
But we also have to figure out

1:30:40.019 --> 1:30:41.771
- this vice president thing, right?  - Right.

1:30:41.854 --> 1:30:43.064
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1:30:43.147 --> 1:30:44.148
That's the vice president.

1:30:44.398 --> 1:30:45.691
Thanks.

1:30:46.317 --> 1:30:47.443
Hello?

1:30:47.527 --> 1:30:49.195
Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1:30:49.529 --> 1:30:51.155
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1:30:51.322 --> 1:30:53.491
We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign.

1:30:53.574 --> 1:30:55.159
We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.

1:30:55.535 --> 1:30:57.912
Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham,

1:30:57.995 --> 1:31:00.248
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1:31:00.331 --> 1:31:03.626
The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes.

1:31:03.709 --> 1:31:04.752
I think we're good, here.

1:31:04.836 --> 1:31:06.838
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.

1:31:07.213 --> 1:31:08.923
They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse.

1:31:09.215 --> 1:31:10.550
They're gonna take out the president somehow.

1:31:10.842 --> 1:31:12.260
We have to immediately alert that plane.

1:31:12.552 --> 1:31:14.595
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down.

1:31:14.679 --> 1:31:17.598
If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1:31:17.765 --> 1:31:19.183
- Thank you, Colonel.  - Rhodes and Stark out.

1:31:21.102 --> 1:31:22.812
Everything okay, sir?

1:31:23.813 --> 1:31:24.897
Couldn't be better.

1:31:31.779 --> 1:31:33.239
I love you, babe.

1:31:53.843 --> 1:31:55.344
Colonel Rhodes.

1:31:55.428 --> 1:31:58.764
Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.

1:32:03.603 --> 1:32:04.729
We gotta make a decision.

1:32:04.812 --> 1:32:07.607
We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.

1:32:07.773 --> 1:32:09.400
Sir, I have an update from Malibu.

1:32:09.483 --> 1:32:11.611
The cranes have finally arrived,

1:32:11.777 --> 1:32:13.738
and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.

1:32:13.821 --> 1:32:15.531
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1:32:15.698 --> 1:32:17.950
The armour is now at 92%.

1:32:18.034 --> 1:32:20.119
That's going to have to do.

1:32:28.961 --> 1:32:30.254
Here he comes. Here he comes. Get a quick picture.

1:32:30.338 --> 1:32:31.380
Sure.

1:32:48.689 --> 1:32:49.690
Everything all right, Colonel?

1:33:22.682 --> 1:33:24.725
It is an honour, Mr President.

1:33:25.101 --> 1:33:27.103
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1:33:27.687 --> 1:33:29.438
Cool your boots, sir.

1:33:29.522 --> 1:33:31.023
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1:33:31.190 --> 1:33:33.609
Sir, Air Force One has been compromised.

1:33:33.693 --> 1:33:35.611
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1:33:35.695 --> 1:33:36.862
Get me eyes on it now.

1:33:37.238 --> 1:33:39.156
Image coming through now, sir.

1:33:41.575 --> 1:33:43.369
Was that Rhodes?

1:33:52.503 --> 1:33:53.879
Is anyone there?

1:33:54.213 --> 1:33:55.881
Let us out!

1:34:12.356 --> 1:34:13.858
The President.

1:34:14.358 --> 1:34:15.568
Now.

1:34:15.651 --> 1:34:16.652
He's not here.

1:34:20.781 --> 1:34:22.533
Try the jet stream?

1:34:23.701 --> 1:34:25.578
Speaking of which, go fish.

1:34:48.309 --> 1:34:50.269
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1:35:03.282 --> 1:35:04.283
How many in the air?

1:35:04.950 --> 1:35:05.993
Thirteen, sir.

1:35:07.912 --> 1:35:09.914
- How many can I carry?  - Four, sir.

1:35:19.340 --> 1:35:22.927
Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?

1:35:28.057 --> 1:35:30.601
Oh, God! No! No!

1:35:31.060 --> 1:35:33.437
Listen to me. See that guy?

1:35:33.646 --> 1:35:35.314
I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him.

1:35:35.940 --> 1:35:37.024
- You got it?  - What?

1:35:39.568 --> 1:35:42.863
I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand.

1:35:44.115 --> 1:35:45.324
We can do this, Heather.

1:35:54.208 --> 1:35:56.460
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:01.924
Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys?

1:36:02.007 --> 1:36:03.092
That's what we're going to do.

1:36:03.175 --> 1:36:04.427
18,000 feet.

1:36:04.510 --> 1:36:05.886
Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey.

1:36:10.975 --> 1:36:12.226
Nice.

1:36:12.601 --> 1:36:14.228
10,000 feet.

1:36:17.606 --> 1:36:18.858
6,000 feet.

1:36:19.024 --> 1:36:20.568
Come on, people.

1:36:21.527 --> 1:36:22.736
Come on, come on, come on!

1:36:26.031 --> 1:36:27.158
Yeah!

1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:29.076
1,000 feet.

1:36:30.244 --> 1:36:31.829
400 feet.

1:36:32.413 --> 1:36:33.622
200 feet, sir.

1:36:33.706 --> 1:36:34.832
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1:36:35.875 --> 1:36:37.042
Hello.

1:36:58.397 --> 1:36:59.482
We made it!

1:37:00.232 --> 1:37:01.692
Nice work, guys!

1:37:01.775 --> 1:37:04.403
Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us.

1:37:04.695 --> 1:37:05.779
All right, Jarvis.

1:37:05.863 --> 1:37:07.406
But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...

1:37:15.289 --> 1:37:16.874
That came out of nowhere.

1:37:16.957 --> 1:37:18.167
Wow.

1:37:18.584 --> 1:37:19.710
Give me some good news, man.

1:37:19.793 --> 1:37:20.794
I think they all made it.

1:37:20.878 --> 1:37:21.837
Thank God.

1:37:21.921 --> 1:37:22.922
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1:37:23.422 --> 1:37:25.299
You couldn't save the president with the suit,

1:37:25.382 --> 1:37:27.510
how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?

1:37:27.593 --> 1:37:29.637
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:31.639
The House Party Protocol, sir?

1:37:31.722 --> 1:37:32.765
Correct.

1:38:03.128 --> 1:38:04.463
Hi.

1:38:11.971 --> 1:38:14.306
You think he's gonna help you?

1:38:14.974 --> 1:38:16.392
He won't.

1:38:20.854 --> 1:38:24.775
Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...

1:38:25.234 --> 1:38:27.945
Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that.

1:38:28.028 --> 1:38:30.239
You're here as my...

1:38:31.156 --> 1:38:32.992
Trophy...

1:38:45.296 --> 1:38:46.547
Good evening, sir.

1:38:51.176 --> 1:38:53.929
Welcome aboard, Mr President.

1:39:02.438 --> 1:39:04.023
Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?

1:39:04.189 --> 1:39:08.902
Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.

1:39:11.238 --> 1:39:12.364
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1:39:12.615 --> 1:39:13.616
And, of course, you'll remember

1:39:13.699 --> 1:39:16.368
that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

1:39:16.619 --> 1:39:19.371
Thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1:39:19.788 --> 1:39:21.540
What do you want from me?

1:39:22.499 --> 1:39:23.751
Nothing, sir.

1:39:24.126 --> 1:39:27.588
I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV.

1:39:27.671 --> 1:39:29.715
You see, I've moved on.

1:39:29.798 --> 1:39:32.176
I found myself a new political patron,

1:39:32.593 --> 1:39:35.387
and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job.

1:39:36.388 --> 1:39:38.223
String him up.

1:39:39.725 --> 1:39:40.893
Hey!

1:39:56.992 --> 1:39:58.619
Come on.

1:40:02.122 --> 1:40:04.041
You're not gonna freak out on me, right?

1:40:04.124 --> 1:40:05.834
I hope not.

1:40:30.484 --> 1:40:32.319
Oh, my God.

1:40:33.946 --> 1:40:36.073
He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.

1:40:36.156 --> 1:40:38.742
Viking funeral. Public execution.

1:40:38.826 --> 1:40:40.619
Yeah, death by oil.

1:40:46.792 --> 1:40:49.837
Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.

1:40:51.296 --> 1:40:52.423
Okay. That's good.

1:40:52.506 --> 1:40:56.343
Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1:40:57.511 --> 1:40:58.762
Is your gun up?

1:40:58.846 --> 1:41:00.431
Yep. What do I do?

1:41:00.514 --> 1:41:02.975
Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.

1:41:03.142 --> 1:41:05.310
Six, high, back. All right.

1:41:14.236 --> 1:41:15.529
You see that? Nailed it.

1:41:16.155 --> 1:41:17.364
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1:41:17.573 --> 1:41:18.657
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1:41:18.741 --> 1:41:19.742
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1:41:21.452 --> 1:41:22.911
All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.

1:41:22.995 --> 1:41:24.037
Over there!

1:41:24.246 --> 1:41:25.831
- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.  - I'm out. Give me...

1:41:25.914 --> 1:41:28.208
- You got extra magazines?  - They're not universal, Tony.

1:41:28.375 --> 1:41:30.419
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.

1:41:30.502 --> 1:41:31.795
- One of yours.  - I don't have one that fits that gun.

1:41:31.879 --> 1:41:32.963
You've got, like, five of them.

1:41:33.046 --> 1:41:34.256
Here's what I'm going to do.

1:41:34.423 --> 1:41:36.300
Save my spot, ready?

1:41:36.383 --> 1:41:39.178
- What'd you see?  - Too fast. Nothing.

1:41:39.261 --> 1:41:40.554
Here we go.

1:41:44.516 --> 1:41:46.351
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

1:41:56.445 --> 1:41:57.988
God, I would kill for some armour right now.

1:41:58.071 --> 1:42:00.032
- You're right. We need backup.  - Yeah, a bunch.

1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:02.826
You know what?

1:42:06.789 --> 1:42:07.873
Is that...

1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:09.833
Yep.

1:42:09.917 --> 1:42:11.543
- Are those...  - Yeah.

1:42:28.227 --> 1:42:29.478
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1:42:34.817 --> 1:42:37.486
Jarvis, target EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1:42:37.569 --> 1:42:39.404
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1:42:39.905 --> 1:42:40.906
Yes, sir.

1:42:44.910 --> 1:42:47.788
What are you waiting for? It's Christmas.

1:42:49.289 --> 1:42:50.332
Take them to church.

1:42:57.422 --> 1:42:59.091
Gentlemen.

1:43:06.348 --> 1:43:07.349
Incoming!

1:43:11.979 --> 1:43:13.605
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1:43:26.618 --> 1:43:28.620
This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?

1:43:28.704 --> 1:43:29.788
Everybody needs a hobby.

1:43:36.295 --> 1:43:37.671
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?

1:44:06.241 --> 1:44:07.826
Nice timing.

1:44:07.910 --> 1:44:10.120
Yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?

1:44:11.496 --> 1:44:13.248
I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

1:44:13.665 --> 1:44:15.584
- What does that mean?  - I got you covered.

1:44:18.879 --> 1:44:21.256
Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?

1:44:21.340 --> 1:44:22.799
Very funny.

1:44:39.858 --> 1:44:41.151
Sir, I've located Ms Potts.

1:44:41.234 --> 1:44:42.235
About time.

1:44:55.248 --> 1:44:59.711
Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1:45:00.754 --> 1:45:04.383
See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?

1:45:05.550 --> 1:45:06.802
You're such a jerk.

1:45:06.969 --> 1:45:08.220
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1:45:10.806 --> 1:45:12.057
Come on. A little more, baby.

1:45:28.573 --> 1:45:29.616
Is this guy bothering you?

1:45:31.410 --> 1:45:32.786
Don't get up.

1:45:37.416 --> 1:45:38.542
Is it hot in there?

1:45:40.836 --> 1:45:42.045
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1:45:43.296 --> 1:45:46.591
Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.

1:45:46.925 --> 1:45:47.926
Tony.

1:45:48.885 --> 1:45:50.012
She's watching.

1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:52.931
I think you should close your eyes.

1:45:53.432 --> 1:45:54.933
Close your eyes.

1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:57.769
Close your eyes. You don't want to see this.

1:46:05.110 --> 1:46:06.903
Yeah, you take a minute.

1:46:39.311 --> 1:46:41.563
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1:46:52.574 --> 1:46:53.575
Come on!

1:46:55.494 --> 1:46:58.705
Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1:46:59.623 --> 1:47:02.000
Just hold on. Hold on.

1:47:14.888 --> 1:47:16.223
Okay.

1:47:23.730 --> 1:47:25.023
Bye-bye.

1:47:36.743 --> 1:47:37.911
Brace yourself.

1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:50.757
You look damn good, Mr President,

1:47:50.924 --> 1:47:52.384
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1:48:05.981 --> 1:48:07.107
The President is secure, Tony.

1:48:07.190 --> 1:48:08.525
- I'm clearing the area.  - Nice work.

1:48:09.651 --> 1:48:11.862
- Ready, sir?  - What do you mean "ready"?

1:48:20.078 --> 1:48:22.831
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you.

1:48:22.914 --> 1:48:23.915
Just look at me!

1:48:26.418 --> 1:48:28.420
Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there.

1:48:28.753 --> 1:48:30.213
All right? You've got to let go.

1:48:30.672 --> 1:48:33.758
You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise.

1:48:36.178 --> 1:48:37.179
No!

1:49:03.955 --> 1:49:07.083
A shame. I would've caught her.

1:49:38.156 --> 1:49:39.241
Eject.

1:50:24.661 --> 1:50:26.246
Well, here we are on the roof.

1:50:36.965 --> 1:50:38.049
Mark 42, inbound.

1:50:38.216 --> 1:50:41.553
I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.

1:50:57.527 --> 1:50:58.528
Whatever.

1:50:59.738 --> 1:51:01.239
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1:51:02.866 --> 1:51:06.619
It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.

1:51:09.414 --> 1:51:11.750
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down!

1:51:11.916 --> 1:51:14.210
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1:51:15.587 --> 1:51:17.505
Here's where you're wrong.

1:51:17.589 --> 1:51:18.798
She was already perfect.

1:51:26.598 --> 1:51:28.183
Jarvis,

1:51:29.267 --> 1:51:30.769
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

1:51:31.186 --> 1:51:32.270
No...

1:52:46.219 --> 1:52:48.304
No more false faces.

1:52:49.180 --> 1:52:50.974
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1:52:52.142 --> 1:52:54.853
You're looking right at him.

1:52:55.186 --> 1:52:58.189
It was always me, Tony. Right from the start.

1:52:58.690 --> 1:53:00.358
I am the Mandarin!

1:53:11.786 --> 1:53:13.037
I got nothing.

1:53:19.878 --> 1:53:22.630
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage!

1:53:30.889 --> 1:53:32.807
What? What, are you mad at me?

1:53:58.917 --> 1:54:00.126
Honey?

1:54:04.380 --> 1:54:06.049
Oh, my God.

1:54:07.592 --> 1:54:09.802
That was really violent.

1:54:10.803 --> 1:54:12.805
You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...

1:54:12.972 --> 1:54:15.016
I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1:54:18.478 --> 1:54:20.146
Who's the hot mess now?

1:54:20.313 --> 1:54:22.398
It's still debatable.

1:54:22.941 --> 1:54:26.361
Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home?

1:54:26.444 --> 1:54:28.363
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1:54:28.446 --> 1:54:31.658
You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits.

1:54:31.824 --> 1:54:34.369
What am I going to complain about now?

1:54:35.203 --> 1:54:36.829
Well, it's me.

1:54:37.622 --> 1:54:38.665
You'll think of something.

1:54:40.250 --> 1:54:41.626
- No, don't touch me.  - Don't worry about it.

1:54:41.709 --> 1:54:43.628
- No, I'm gonna burn you.  - No, you're not.

1:54:44.671 --> 1:54:45.672
Not hot.

1:54:47.090 --> 1:54:48.758
Am I gonna be okay?

1:54:48.841 --> 1:54:49.842
No.

1:54:49.968 --> 1:54:52.637
You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay.

1:54:52.929 --> 1:54:54.764
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1:54:55.014 --> 1:54:56.724
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk.

1:54:56.808 --> 1:54:59.936
I think I can get you better.

1:55:00.562 --> 1:55:03.064
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1:55:03.147 --> 1:55:05.441
And all your distractions?

1:55:06.359 --> 1:55:08.069
Eh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit.

1:55:08.319 --> 1:55:10.697
Jarvis. Hey.

1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:14.075
All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?

1:55:14.325 --> 1:55:16.286
You know what to do.

1:55:16.369 --> 1:55:19.122
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?

1:55:19.205 --> 1:55:22.375
Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.

1:55:58.661 --> 1:55:59.954
Okay, so far? Do you like it?

1:56:02.540 --> 1:56:03.541
It will do.

1:56:12.675 --> 1:56:18.139
And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end.

1:56:21.517 --> 1:56:23.519
You start with something pure,

1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:28.775
something exciting. Then, come the mistakes.

1:56:29.901 --> 1:56:31.569
The compromises.

1:56:38.117 --> 1:56:40.828
We create our own demons.

1:56:46.084 --> 1:56:48.252
Great to see you! Bloody hell!

1:56:49.796 --> 1:56:53.508
As promised, I got Pepper sorted out. It took some tinkering.

1:56:53.591 --> 1:56:57.387
But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"

1:57:01.224 --> 1:57:04.560
Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous,

1:57:04.644 --> 1:57:08.147
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.

1:57:08.564 --> 1:57:11.609
And now, neither will I.

1:57:12.402 --> 1:57:14.320
Let me tell you,

1:57:14.404 --> 1:57:16.531
that was the best sleep I'd had in years.

1:57:37.427 --> 1:57:39.387
It's okay. It's okay.

1:57:39.470 --> 1:57:40.513
It's okay.

1:57:40.596 --> 1:57:41.597
No, look.

1:58:58.883 --> 1:59:02.929
So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever...

1:59:03.012 --> 1:59:07.308
I guess I'd say my armour, it was never a distraction,

1:59:07.391 --> 1:59:09.477
or a hobby.

1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:11.562
It was a cocoon.

1:59:12.772 --> 1:59:14.565
And now,

1:59:15.525 --> 1:59:17.819
I'm a changed man.

1:59:26.744 --> 1:59:30.414
You can take away my house, and all my tricks and toys.

1:59:31.415 --> 1:59:34.252
One thing you can't take away...

1:59:36.796 --> 1:59:38.589
I am Iron Man.

2:09:04.405 --> 2:09:06.740
You know, and thank you by the way. For listening.

2:09:06.824 --> 2:09:09.284
Plus, something about getting it off my chest,

2:09:09.368 --> 2:09:12.913
and putting it out there in the atmosphere instead of holding this in...

2:09:12.996 --> 2:09:15.707
I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know.

2:09:15.791 --> 2:09:18.836
Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.

2:09:18.919 --> 2:09:21.422
To be able to share all my intimate thoughts

2:09:21.505 --> 2:09:22.631
and my experiences with someone,

2:09:22.714 --> 2:09:25.259
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

2:09:25.342 --> 2:09:26.718
You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail.

2:09:26.802 --> 2:09:28.554
Everything comes full circle.

2:09:28.637 --> 2:09:32.057
And the fact that you've been able to help me process...

2:09:34.601 --> 2:09:36.061
- Are you with me?  - Sorry... I was, yeah.

2:09:36.145 --> 2:09:37.229
We were at...

2:09:37.438 --> 2:09:38.647
Are you actively napping?

2:09:38.772 --> 2:09:41.024
I was... I... I drifted.

2:09:41.525 --> 2:09:42.693
Where did I lose you?

2:09:44.695 --> 2:09:46.363
Elevator in Switzerland.

2:09:47.990 --> 2:09:49.408
So, you heard none of it.

2:09:49.741 --> 2:09:52.703
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

2:09:53.328 --> 2:09:54.621
I'm not a therapist.

2:09:54.788 --> 2:09:56.665
- It's not my training.  - So?

2:09:56.790 --> 2:09:58.417
- I don't have the...  - What? The time?

2:09:58.500 --> 2:09:59.751
Temperament.

2:10:00.002 --> 2:10:01.545
You know what? Now that I think about it...

2:10:01.628 --> 2:10:03.005
God, my original wound.

2:10:03.255 --> 2:10:05.424
- 1983, all right?  - Yes.

2:10:05.507 --> 2:10:08.218
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.
