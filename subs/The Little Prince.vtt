there was a little prince

19:01.682 --> 19:04.893
who lived on a planet
that was scarcely bigger than himself,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.686
and who had need of a friend.

(BLEATING)

And the second one,
not to his liking either.

Don't you see? that's not a sheep.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.219
This is a ram, it has horns.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.514
- And this one was...
- Too old!

21:50.351 --> 21:53.812
I want a sheep
that will live for a long time.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.858
So, I drew this.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.531
The sheep you ask for is inside.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.410
That is exactly the way I wanted it!

22:10.913 --> 22:13.957
Do you think this sheep
will eat a great deal of grass?

22:13.958 --> 22:17.168
Because where I live,
everything is very small.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.505
Well, I'm sure there will be
enough grass for him.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.048
He's a very small sheep.

Oh, You didn't like it?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.443
- No. No I did.
- Well, I...

24:47.945 --> 24:49.028
It's not very good.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.446
I think it's nice.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.991
I read a story, too. Attentively.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.494
And I found it quite odd.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.329
Odd?

24:58.455 --> 25:01.124
I mean curious... Or interesting...

25:01.375 --> 25:03.668
I guess I have some issues
with some of the facts.

I don't mean to be rude. Can I?

25:08.382 --> 25:10.842
What? Be rude?
Sure, go ahead. What you got?

25:11.385 --> 25:15.054
Well, first of all, what was the kid
doing there in the desert?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.181
That's very strange.

25:16.265 --> 25:19.434
No one can last very long
in a desert without food and water.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.353
Where are his parents?
Does he even go to school?

25:22.521 --> 25:25.231
Does he really live up there?
Because I took basic astronomy

25:25.316 --> 25:29.068
and there was no mention of life,
or children, on any other planets.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.071
Unless it's true
that he came from a star.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.239
But that seem improbable.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.159
Not a star. An asteroid.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.828
Asteroid B-612.

25:38.913 --> 25:41.748
Oh, we didn't cover asteroids.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.836
But the fact that he wanted a sheep,
that pretty much proves that he exists.

Huh, I never looked at it that way.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.154
Where did you get all this stuff?

26:13.572 --> 26:17.992
Oh, well, as you live you'll own
some things just kind of stick to you.

- Hoarding!

he was very fond of sunsets.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.371
One day he saw 44 of them.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.081
Uh, What?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.375
Well, His planet, it was so small,

27:49.460 --> 27:53.379
all he had to do was move his chair
a few steps to see another one.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.217
But a small planet also had drawbacks.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.971
He needed
a sheep to eat the baobab sprouts.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.765
- Baobab?
- Yeah.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.725
It's a very greedy tree.

28:06.602 --> 28:11.439
And every day, he toiled
to stop them from turning up.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.733
For if you intervene too late...

28:14.276 --> 28:15.943

Catastrophe.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.572
Now, luckily, there are good seeds, too.

28:19.865 --> 28:24.452
And one day, from a seed blown
from no one knew where,

28:24.828 --> 28:27.830
a new kind of sprout came up.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.840

to torment him with her vanity.

to put me under a glass.

that they loved each other.

But they were both too young
to know how to love.

It seems that
you've finally done something...

1:15:55.051 --> 1:15:56.635
Let go.

1:15:58.346 --> 1:16:01.139
You will tell the Businessman?
How essential I've been?

1:16:01.349 --> 1:16:03.975
Yes, I most certainly will.

1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:08.021
The Businessman told me about this...

1:16:08.147 --> 1:16:11.483
evidence of childhood
you brought with you.

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:14.152
- Please! Those are important!
- No!

1:16:14.237 --> 1:16:16.238
There is nothing essential in here at all.

1:16:19.700 --> 1:16:21.076
It is time

1:16:22.161 --> 1:16:23.203
to grow up.

1:16:23.412 --> 1:16:26.998
"THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE
TO EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL"

1:16:28.084 --> 1:16:30.919
How could everything essential
fit into just one book?

1:16:31.170 --> 1:16:33.171
It is incredibly succinct.

1:16:33.839 --> 1:16:35.090
And single-spaced.

1:16:35.841 --> 1:16:40.178
So, what? I'm supposed to read this
over and over and over, until I'm old?

1:16:40.513 --> 1:16:41.513
Not at all.

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:46.685
Here, we take a more
accelerated approach to growing up.

1:16:49.605 --> 1:16:51.940
Isn't that right, Mr. Prince?

1:16:52.108 --> 1:16:53.999
No, never mind.
(CACKLING)

1:16:54.026 --> 1:16:57.445
That blank look,
you've forgotten everything, haven't you?

1:17:04.287 --> 1:17:08.123
Now, you're going to feel a slight pinch.
Just relax.

1:17:08.708 --> 1:17:10.375
Yes! Please sign there.

1:17:10.543 --> 1:17:13.003
A consent form releasing myself,
the Businessman,

1:17:13.087 --> 1:17:15.338
- and the corporation from all liability...
- Help!

1:17:15.423 --> 1:17:16.881
...in case of accidental death

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:19.718
or dismemberment during
the centralising process.

1:17:20.136 --> 1:17:21.928
I'm trying to help you!

1:17:22.054 --> 1:17:24.723
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

1:17:26.976 --> 1:17:28.059
Leave them!

1:17:30.896 --> 1:17:32.981
I said, leave them!

1:17:33.566 --> 1:17:36.318
Act your age, Mr. Prince!

1:17:36.819 --> 1:17:38.820
Remember, you are
a graduate of my class.

1:17:41.115 --> 1:17:43.491
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

1:17:48.005 --> 1:17:49.581
(CLEARING THROAT)

1:17:49.582 --> 1:17:51.791
Return to your desk, please.

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:02.344
Oh, I didn't think that through.

1:18:02.970 --> 1:18:05.847
The Businessman
is going to be very disappointed in me.

1:18:06.265 --> 1:18:08.933
Thank you. But why?

1:18:09.769 --> 1:18:12.729
I never knew what this was,
or where I even got it,

1:18:12.813 --> 1:18:15.190
but I thought maybe it was important...

1:18:16.025 --> 1:18:17.067
Your sheep!

1:18:17.151 --> 1:18:18.526
My sheep? Ha-ha.

1:18:19.987 --> 1:18:20.987
I don't get it.

1:18:21.322 --> 1:18:23.031
The Aviator gave it to you

1:18:23.115 --> 1:18:25.533
in the desert on Earth,
to eat the baobabs.

1:18:26.035 --> 1:18:28.036
- Catastrophe.
- Catastrophe.

1:18:28.371 --> 1:18:29.454
That's right.

1:18:29.705 --> 1:18:31.831
The Aviator drew all of these for you.

1:18:32.291 --> 1:18:36.294
- He really needs you right now.
- Me? He needs me?

1:18:39.632 --> 1:18:43.551
THE AVIATOR: Growing up is not
the problem. Forgetting is.

1:18:47.723 --> 1:18:48.890
I have an idea.

1:18:49.642 --> 1:18:51.976
We're just need...
(GASPS) My plane!

1:18:55.314 --> 1:18:56.356
There it is!

1:18:57.191 --> 1:18:58.566
It's okay.

1:19:05.825 --> 1:19:06.991
Hurry!

1:19:24.005 --> 1:19:26.420
(BUTTONS BEEPING)

1:19:33.227 --> 1:19:35.061
We did it!

1:19:40.192 --> 1:19:41.526
Oh, No!

1:19:46.949 --> 1:19:48.199
Which button?

1:19:54.373 --> 1:19:56.540
- No, no, no...

1:20:22.651 --> 1:20:23.735
Yes!

1:20:25.279 --> 1:20:27.906
We can catch it on top of the next pile!

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:30.241
Wait, where's Mr. Prince?

1:20:41.670 --> 1:20:42.962
I remember these.

1:20:43.964 --> 1:20:45.757
The stars.

1:20:45.841 --> 1:20:47.425
What are they all doing here?

1:20:54.141 --> 1:20:56.935
Look at the stars.
The stars are beautiful...

1:20:57.019 --> 1:20:58.853
The stars are beautiful

1:20:58.938 --> 1:21:01.773
because of a flower
that cannot be seen.

1:21:03.359 --> 1:21:06.277
Because of a flower
that cannot be seen?

1:21:06.487 --> 1:21:07.654
Your rose!

1:21:08.030 --> 1:21:10.532
I have a rose...

1:21:11.450 --> 1:21:14.035
THE BUSINESSMAN:
I see you've found my collection,

1:21:14.119 --> 1:21:19.332
501,622,731 stars.

1:21:20.209 --> 1:21:22.502
You? You did this?

1:21:22.628 --> 1:21:24.671
But you're supposed
to just count the stars.

1:21:24.964 --> 1:21:29.551
Own! Say it with me.
Own. I own the stars.

1:21:32.012 --> 1:21:33.888
Thank you. Thank you.

1:21:35.391 --> 1:21:38.977
They used to be merely
little golden objects in the sky

1:21:39.061 --> 1:21:42.564
that set lazy men to idle dreaming.

1:21:42.982 --> 1:21:47.485
But now, the stars
have finally been made essential.

1:21:48.571 --> 1:21:49.862
Where did you get that?

1:21:51.323 --> 1:21:52.740
She's curious.

1:21:52.825 --> 1:21:54.826
Isn't that just like a child?

1:21:58.080 --> 1:21:59.122
No!

1:21:59.206 --> 1:22:00.248
Thank you.

1:22:00.332 --> 1:22:01.708
All right! Enough.

1:22:01.834 --> 1:22:04.002
- Thank you.
- All right!

1:22:04.878 --> 1:22:06.170
Enough!

1:22:08.549 --> 1:22:11.342
What are you going to do
with all the stars?

1:22:11.427 --> 1:22:14.012
Don't worry, my little girl.

1:22:14.096 --> 1:22:16.431
I put the stars to good use.

1:22:34.867 --> 1:22:39.454
There. You see? The inessential has
become perfectly essential.

1:22:40.122 --> 1:22:42.540
How it should be for all things.

1:22:43.042 --> 1:22:44.375
Take her back to the classroom.

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:46.210
Make sure no one interferes.

1:22:46.962 --> 1:22:49.714
- Stop it! Put me down. I can't...
- Stop wriggling!

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:52.717
- Don't let them do this to me.
- You're not gonna get away.

1:22:53.427 --> 1:22:55.053
- Wait.
- Wait?

1:22:55.763 --> 1:22:58.473
I've given you 371 jobs,

1:22:58.557 --> 1:23:01.601
and you have been fired
from 370 of them.

1:23:01.727 --> 1:23:05.396
I think it's time you get back to work,
my little failure.

1:23:06.398 --> 1:23:08.191
No! Please, Leave!

1:23:08.275 --> 1:23:09.734
Stop wriggling.

1:23:11.070 --> 1:23:12.570
Stop!

1:23:12.946 --> 1:23:15.573
- Take your hands off her.
- What? Stop?

1:23:16.241 --> 1:23:18.910
I'm not a failure. I'm...

1:23:19.286 --> 1:23:20.411
I'm the Little Prince.

1:23:20.663 --> 1:23:21.663
- (GIRL GASPS)
- What?

1:23:22.998 --> 1:23:26.999
- He thinks he's little, and a prince!
- (ALL LAUGHING)

Look at me! I'm a bumble bee.

What are you? A duck?

1:23:42.685 --> 1:23:43.935
He's hopeless.

1:23:45.521 --> 1:23:48.439
I'm not hopeless, I'm hopeful!

1:23:49.191 --> 1:23:51.609
That's right! I'm full of hope!

1:23:52.528 --> 1:23:54.028
And I love a rose!

1:23:54.488 --> 1:23:56.489
And she loves me,
and she is waiting for me!

1:23:56.949 --> 1:23:58.366
So...

1:23:58.450 --> 1:24:00.284
I don't think I want to work
for you any more.

1:24:00.869 --> 1:24:02.286
And um...

1:24:03.372 --> 1:24:04.455
I quit!

1:24:06.025 --> 1:24:08.519
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1:24:08.502 --> 1:24:10.294
I quit!

1:24:17.845 --> 1:24:18.845
That pile!

1:24:23.350 --> 1:24:26.811
When are you going to forget about
being a child?

1:24:27.479 --> 1:24:28.521
Never!

1:24:31.316 --> 1:24:32.483
Sorry, Mr. Prince!

1:24:32.901 --> 1:24:36.320
No, it's my fault.
My face shouldn't have been there.

1:24:36.530 --> 1:24:37.572
Good.

1:24:45.831 --> 1:24:46.914
No.

1:24:51.670 --> 1:24:52.920
I'm scared.

1:25:09.521 --> 1:25:10.938
Hang on!

1:25:21.784 --> 1:25:23.951
- I'll be right back!
- Where are you going?

1:25:24.787 --> 1:25:26.370
Wait! Where are you going?

1:25:27.623 --> 1:25:29.040
That's not good.

1:25:37.424 --> 1:25:40.802
I will grow up, but I'll never
be a grown-up like you!

1:25:53.982 --> 1:25:55.066
Wow!

1:26:12.417 --> 1:26:13.459
No!

1:26:20.801 --> 1:26:21.926
Gotcha!

1:26:32.145 --> 1:26:33.187
I got you, too.

1:27:02.384 --> 1:27:03.718
Wonderful.

1:27:15.214 --> 1:27:18.999
This is very, very bad for business.
(SNIFFLES)

1:27:22.154 --> 1:27:23.696
MR. PRINCE: That was amazing!

1:27:27.492 --> 1:27:28.868
The stars are back.

1:27:30.662 --> 1:27:32.997
I forgot how beautiful they are.

1:27:34.708 --> 1:27:38.628
- Look! Asteroid 325!
- You remember!

1:27:38.712 --> 1:27:40.338
And 326!

Look! B-612!

1:27:53.018 --> 1:27:54.101
The baobabs.

1:27:59.900 --> 1:28:01.901
Your rose! She's there!

1:28:02.861 --> 1:28:04.195
Hold on!

1:28:04.696 --> 1:28:06.530
You're not going to try and land,
are you?

1:28:08.367 --> 1:28:11.535
No, stop! Turn around! Stop!

Uh, we're falling.

- Sit still.

And grow up.

1:30:41.228 --> 1:30:42.728
And forget all about him.

You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

1:36:17.313 --> 1:36:18.814

It's wonderful.

1:36:31.327 --> 1:36:33.662
Look. You see? That's the fox.
