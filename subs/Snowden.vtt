WEBVTT

01:25.080 --> 01:26.241
So?

01:26.680 --> 01:27.841
This is the only alligator.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.489
Four minutes past. We walk in one minute.
He was clear on that.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.241
He's coming.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.450
No, he's too young to
have that kind of access.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.326
Uh, what time does
the restaurant open?

02:05.400 --> 02:08.563
Noon. But the food's
a little too spicy.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.041
This way.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.130
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.481
Thank you.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.201
Right here.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.283
It's, uh, really great
to finally meet you guys.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.086
So, first thing, can I get
your cell phones, please?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.601
Thank you.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.886
We want Laura to be
the only one recording, right?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.689
As discussed? Thank you.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.731
I actually bought this.
It blocks UHF frequencies.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.130
You've been
photographed before, right?

03:37.640 --> 03:40.883
Yeah, it's been a while
since anybody took a photo of me, so...

03:40.960 --> 03:42.849
Try thinking of
this as your friend.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.400
Take your time.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.326
Um...

03:51.120 --> 03:53.202
Can you start by telling us
why you did what you did

03:53.280 --> 03:55.362
and, uh, how you gained access

03:55.440 --> 03:57.010
to such a vast
amount of information,

03:57.160 --> 03:58.685
all of which I read
on the plane

03:58.800 --> 04:00.689
- and...
- Glenn.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.483
Uh, how about we just start
with your name? Okay?

04:09.360 --> 04:12.842
My name is
Edward Joseph Snowden.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.401
I'm 29 years old.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.041
I work as a private
contractor for the NSA.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.043
I've also worked as
a private contractor

04:23.200 --> 04:27.649
for the CIA and directly
for the Agency.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.121
I've worked in various jobs
in the intelligence industry

04:30.200 --> 04:31.884
for the last nine years.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.211
I've been a systems engineer, uh,
been a solutions consultant...

04:37.320 --> 04:39.163
Uh...

04:39.320 --> 04:43.086
And a senior advisor for
the Central Intelligence Agency.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.330
- Rangers...
- Rangers...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.084
- Rangers...
- Rangers...

04:47.160 --> 04:48.446
So you
wanna be Special Forces?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.045
Sir, yes, sir!

04:50.120 --> 04:52.646
I think Special Forces
would be ashamed

04:52.720 --> 04:54.961
to call you soldiers.
Am I right?

04:55.040 --> 04:56.246
Sir, no, sir!

04:56.320 --> 05:00.530
Your left.
Your left, right. Your left.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.888
Went from driving Cadillacs

05:05.240 --> 05:08.289
Went from driving Cadillacs

05:08.760 --> 05:12.446
To driving convoys in Iraq

05:12.560 --> 05:15.211
To driving convoys in Iraq

05:15.400 --> 05:16.686
Move it, soldier!

05:20.400 --> 05:22.243
Go! Go!
Move now!

05:23.760 --> 05:25.410
Move!
You better get going!

05:25.520 --> 05:27.204
Pick it up,
you waste of space!

05:27.760 --> 05:28.966
Let's move!

05:31.200 --> 05:32.770
Come on, soldier! Go!

05:34.120 --> 05:35.360
Come on, darling!

05:36.560 --> 05:38.324
Snowden?
What the hell are you doing?

05:38.440 --> 05:39.487
Nothing, sir!

05:39.560 --> 05:41.403
Where is your fucking heart?
Right here, sir!

05:41.480 --> 05:43.960
I want you to reach way down in
that pathetic excuse of a chest,

05:44.040 --> 05:45.326
and you rip it out.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.084
You find your heart,
and then you get

05:47.200 --> 05:48.964
your broke ass on my tower!
You got that?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.007
Sir, yes, sir!

05:50.120 --> 05:51.610
Now get the fuck
out of my face!

05:53.320 --> 05:56.324
I need you on my tower,
gentlemen! Let's move!

05:59.720 --> 06:01.609
Move! Move! Let's go!

06:01.720 --> 06:04.690
Rise and shine, maggots!

06:04.800 --> 06:08.122
Get your hands off your dicks, and
get the fuck out of my barracks!

06:08.200 --> 06:09.531
You guys got one minute!

06:09.600 --> 06:11.807
Fall out! Move, move, move!

06:11.920 --> 06:13.365
Get the hell out here! Get
the hell out of my barracks!

06:14.720 --> 06:16.051
Move it!
Keep moving!

06:16.120 --> 06:18.441
Let's go!
All right, gentlemen.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.241
- Harrison?
- Here!

06:22.360 --> 06:23.441
- Carson?
- Here!

06:23.520 --> 06:24.567
- Ramirez?
- Here!

06:24.640 --> 06:25.687
Fuck!

06:25.760 --> 06:26.761
- Pierce?
- Here!

06:27.320 --> 06:28.526
Coulson?
Help!

06:28.600 --> 06:29.806
Snowden!

06:30.640 --> 06:33.803
Snowden!
Where the fuck is Snowden?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.644
Help!

06:36.680 --> 06:39.604
You know, you've been walking
around on two broken legs...

06:39.680 --> 06:41.808
Best I can tell, for weeks.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.245
Now this is what happens when
you put a 80-pound rucksack

06:47.320 --> 06:48.560
on a 150-pound body.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.927
You get these little stress
fractures and...

06:51.320 --> 06:52.287
- Easy.
- Sorry.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.600
They build up
in your tibias.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.763
You don't get off of 'em,
and eventually they just bust.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.320
Now, you're gonna be
here for a few weeks,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.929
and then I'd count on
another eight weeks or so

07:03.000 --> 07:04.206
on the crutches.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.044
Okay,
and then when do I go back?

07:06.120 --> 07:09.283
Son, you ever again
land on those legs of yours,

07:09.360 --> 07:12.762
airborne or not, those
bones will turn to powder.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.320
I'm gonna authorize
an administrative discharge.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.841
Plenty of other ways
to serve your country.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.762
Have you ever committed
a crime for which you weren't caught?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.447
No.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.927
Have you ever
cheated on an exam?

07:53.640 --> 07:54.641
No.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.765
Do you believe
the United States

07:57.880 --> 07:59.291
is the greatest
country in the world?

07:59.640 --> 08:00.846
Yes.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.569
Why do you
want to join the CIA?

08:05.160 --> 08:07.401
How would you
explain the Internet to a child?

08:09.320 --> 08:13.006
Granddad retired as
an admiral and joined the FBI.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.686
Dad's in the Coast Guard,
30-year man.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.604
What has been the
most important day in your life?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.205
9/11.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.931
We thought my grandfather
was inside the Pentagon.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.885
Uh, turned out he was
off-site that day.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.520
You wanted
to be Special Forces?

08:28.600 --> 08:32.924
Yes, sir. Yeah, I love their motto.
<i>De oppresso liber.</i>

08:33.000 --> 08:37.767
Is that what you hope to do
with us? Free people from oppression?

08:37.840 --> 08:40.286
I'd like to help my country
make a difference in the world.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.326
Uh, the Internet
is a technology

08:45.240 --> 08:46.730
that has the power

08:46.800 --> 08:50.327
to let everyone in the world
understand each other.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.883
Missed a perfect score on the
ASVAB test by a single question.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.726
Crushed the language
learning test.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.406
Some Mandarin,
some Japanese.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.843
And no high school diploma.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.883
So why did you stop
attending high school?

09:08.520 --> 09:12.411
I had to make money. My parents
were divorcing at the time.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.930
Any other influences?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.801
I'd say Joseph Campbell,

09:19.640 --> 09:23.247
Star Wars,
Thoreau, Ayn Rand...

09:24.440 --> 09:27.649
One man can stop
the motor of the world.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.166
Atlas Shrugged.
Yes, sir. I believe that.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.641
Let's try again.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.161
Why do you want
to join the CIA?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.480
Uh...

09:39.760 --> 09:42.570
Well, frankly, sir,

09:44.400 --> 09:47.529
it sounds really cool to have
top security clearance.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.364
It's not enough.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.561
Ordinarily. But these
are not ordinary times.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.488
Bombs won't stop terrorism,
brains will,

10:13.600 --> 10:15.682
and we don't have
nearly enough of those.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.122
I'm gonna give you
a shot, Snowden.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.604
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
You won't regret this.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.049
My name's Corbin O'Brian.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.691
I have many titles,
among them Senior Instructor.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.882
You'll be joining
my class at The Hill.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.010
Stop the vehicle.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.206
Shut off the engine.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.131
I need to see your ID.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.167
All right. Using your left
hand only, pop the trunk.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.807
Now place your hands

10:48.880 --> 10:50.769
through the steering wheel
on the dashboard.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.565
Through the steering wheel.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.646
On the dashboard.
Do not exit the vehicle.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.321
Right here. Right here.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.685
Excuse me.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.604
You'll be looking
for Corbin's class.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.365
End of the hall, keep going
through the second set of doors.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.922
Thank you.
Is that an Enigma?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.920
No.
Enigma was broken.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.810
This is the follow up,
the Sigaba. Never broken.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.080
Cold War's greatest
encryption machine.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.484
Tides of history ticked with
this motor and these rotors.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.444
Wow! One day everyone's gonna
want a machine like this.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.329
I always wanted to learn cryptography.
What's this one?

11:43.960 --> 11:45.769
The Hot Line.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.605
First direct link between
Washington and Moscow.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.728
Probably
prevented World War III.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.881
You got a name? How do I
know you're not the enemy?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.849
Oh, sorry. Uh,
Snowden. Ed Snowden.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.810
Hank Forrester.
Where'd you study, Snowden?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.848
Mostly I'm, uh, self-taught.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.846
You can tell me if you're
busy, but is that a Cray-1?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.800
Why, yes. Yes, it is.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.410
The first supercomputer.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.164
You can get all of
this on a cell phone now.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.965
Yeah. So you're, um,
an engineer?

12:18.360 --> 12:21.842
Am I an engineer?
Instructor and counselor, too.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.161
I'm supposed to keep
an eye on you CTs,

12:24.240 --> 12:26.322
make sure you don't buckle
under the pressure.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.686
Turn to drugs and booze.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.807
Well, you won't have that problem with me.
I don't drink or do drugs.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.530
What is your sin
of choice?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.523
Uh, computers.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.761
Well, then, Snowden, you've come
to the right little whorehouse.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.524
The front lines in
the global war on terror

12:46.600 --> 12:48.523
are not in Iraq
or Afghanistan.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.002
They're here. In London,

12:54.240 --> 12:55.480
Berlin,

12:56.560 --> 12:57.766
Istanbul...

12:58.440 --> 13:00.681
Any server,
any connection...

13:02.120 --> 13:04.726
The modern battlefield

13:05.320 --> 13:06.606
is everywhere.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.005
Which means

13:10.600 --> 13:14.810
you don't have to sit in the ditch
eating MREs or dodging mortar fire,

13:14.880 --> 13:20.683
it means that if there is another
9/11, it'll be your fault.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.411
Just as the last one
was my generation's.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.730
Believe me, you do not want
to live with that burden.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.247
We're gonna start
with an aptitude test.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.843
Each of you is gonna build
a covert communications network

13:42.920 --> 13:44.410
in your home city,

13:45.960 --> 13:50.170
you're gonna deploy it,
back up your site, destroy it,

13:50.240 --> 13:51.924
and restore it again.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.809
The point of this
exercise is to keep

13:54.880 --> 13:57.486
your infrastructure up
and running securely.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.771
The average test
time is five hours.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.130
If you take more than eight,
you will fail.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.211
Mr. O'Brian?

14:32.640 --> 14:33.971
I'm done, sir.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.851
You don't have to tell me
when you've completed a stage.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.809
No, I finished
the whole thing.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.170
It's been 40 minutes.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.526
Thirty-eight.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.806
What?

14:44.480 --> 14:45.811
Thirty-eight minutes.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.727
Okay. Let's see
where you screwed up.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.771
You didn't say we had
to do it in order, sir.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.923
Sol, uh, broke
the sequence to save time,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.085
and I automated the backup process
to run as I built the site.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.046
Eyes on screens.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.521
Sir?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.484
What should I do now?

15:37.560 --> 15:38.925
Whatever you want.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.922
Hey.
Hi.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.209
Finally.
Yeah.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.481
Um, sorry.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.244
Do you, um,
want anything?

16:35.320 --> 16:38.051
No. Let's go for a walk.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.804
You could use some sun.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.086
Yeah.
You mentioned that earlier.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.481
Sorry it took me
this long. I just...

16:47.880 --> 16:51.771
You didn't want to see me on crutches.
I was not so agile.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.724
And then this
new job hit. So...

16:53.800 --> 16:56.246
Oh, yeah, what was it
you were doing again?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.243
I'm doing analysis for
the State Department.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.368
Right. Congratulations.
Thanks.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.885
You're welcome.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.689
Hey, can you
do me a favor

17:03.760 --> 17:06.001
and, um, point in the direction
of the State Department?

17:06.760 --> 17:07.966
Uh...

17:11.160 --> 17:12.605
Yeah, it's that way.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.401
Where? Are you sure?

17:16.520 --> 17:19.285
I mean, I'm not that great
at orienting myself...

17:19.360 --> 17:21.601
Not that great
at lying, either.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.286
You're gonna have to work on
both if you wanna be a spy.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.490
Where I came from,
everyone's parents

17:27.560 --> 17:29.642
worked for
the "State Department."

17:29.880 --> 17:32.690
Plus, every time you visited
my website this week,

17:32.760 --> 17:36.526
which was quite often,
it was from an IP in Virginia.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.768
You know how to run an IP trace?
Yeah.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.081
I'm pretty sure that the State
Department has no offices in Virginia.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.965
Huh?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.885
All right,
let's see you strut it.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.526
Let's see what?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.170
Let's see you strut it. Show
me what you got, you know.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.924
Your best catwalk.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.447
Don't be shy.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.807
Come on. You got this.
Uh... All right.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.646
I don't know.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.210
Drop Bush, not bombs!

18:17.280 --> 18:21.001
Drop Bush, not bombs!

18:21.200 --> 18:23.362
Excuse me. Would you mind
signing our petition, please?

18:23.440 --> 18:24.771
Yes, absolutely.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.769
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Sir?

18:28.840 --> 18:29.921
No, thank you.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.170
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like to sign?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.924
I actually just signed. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you very much.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.001
Thank you.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.528
Too much independent
spirit for you?

18:41.120 --> 18:44.841
Uh, no, I just don't really
like bashing my country.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.726
It's my country too, and right
now it has blood on its hands.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.124
Sorry, I just... I have friends
who are over there right now.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.561
I'm not talking
about the troops.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.483
I'm talking about the moron
sending them to war.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.404
Moron? You mean
our Commander-in-Chief?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.881
Yeah, whatever you want to call him.
He's still wrong.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.689
How do you know he's wrong?
You're just lashing out.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.560
No, I'm not lashing out. I'm
questioning our government.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.766
That's what we do
in this country.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.207
That is the principle
that we were founded on.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.444
Okay, but how about
questioning the liberal media?

19:16.720 --> 19:20.611
I mean, you're just buying
into what one side is saying.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.051
Maybe I am,
'cause my side is right.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.728
See, that's funny, 'cause my side's right.
Oh, really?

19:26.800 --> 19:29.087
Yeah.
Uh...

19:29.880 --> 19:33.202
Why is it smart conservatives
always make me so mad?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.601
Probably because you don't
like hearing the truth.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.046
You are a very frustrating
individual, you know that?

19:41.800 --> 19:43.962
How am I going
to make you see?

19:44.040 --> 19:46.281
I can see just fine,
thank you.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.160
That help at all?

19:56.520 --> 19:59.046
Nope. No, that did
nothing for me.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.360
Tastes like liberal.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.284
It's not my thing.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.126
Is it constitutional
to bypass the Courts?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.806
No. The Fourth Amendment
prevents searches

20:16.880 --> 20:18.325
and seizures
without a warrant.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.927
That's absolutely right,
Rio. Which means

20:22.760 --> 20:25.570
your Commander-in-Chief, the
President of the United States,

20:25.640 --> 20:27.483
is breaking the law.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.489
That is what you're saying,
isn't it, Rio?

20:30.640 --> 20:35.521
Well, I guess it depends
on who you talk to.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.443
And if you talk
to journalists?

20:38.160 --> 20:41.960
Who, more often than not,
don't have the full picture,

20:42.040 --> 20:45.487
or neglect to report it,
you only get a partial truth.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.925
Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.525
The FISA Court.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.284
We do respect the Fourth
Amendment in this country,

20:57.400 --> 20:58.925
and we issue warrants
based on suspicion.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.370
But sometimes these warrants have
to be issued by secret courts,

21:04.440 --> 21:07.091
so we don't alert
the suspects we're spying on.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.363
And these court proceedings
are classified,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.204
which means, surprise...

21:13.560 --> 21:16.450
They don't appear in papers
such as The New York Times.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.166
Did you see my test scores?

21:19.280 --> 21:22.523
Yes. Top of my class.
Like you. What, here?

21:22.600 --> 21:25.683
NSA. They liked me plenty.

21:25.760 --> 21:30.049
They put me on all the best teams.
Soviet frontier. Desert Storm.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.562
And then
the big new challenge,

21:32.640 --> 21:37.168
find the terrorist in the Internet
haystack. Hell of a haystack.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.685
Hundreds of
terabytes a minute.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.684
I mean, it would take you 400
years to read the emails.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.808
Then you have
to analyze them.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.841
Sometimes, the more you
look, the less you see.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.763
- What'd you come up with?
- Something beautiful.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.241
In house.
For $3 million.

21:52.320 --> 21:56.405
A program that could differentiate
between foreign and domestic,

21:56.480 --> 22:00.121
encrypt every signal we weren't
targeting, so it would remain private.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.442
It was elegant, streamlined.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.363
It was the best
work I ever did.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.081
Have a seat.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.960
What was it called?

22:17.920 --> 22:23.131
Ed, rising to
the top in our world

22:23.200 --> 22:26.568
can sometimes
be hard on a man.

22:26.640 --> 22:31.009
I mean... You think
you're making strides,

22:31.120 --> 22:33.771
you think you're
taking the initiative.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.490
And then, the next minute, they
grind your work out of existence.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.042
They didn't use it?
Why not?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.521
Well,
they never tell you why.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.646
Two years later,
after 9/11,

22:46.760 --> 22:48.046
a friend of mine
tells me about

22:48.120 --> 22:50.930
this new contractor
program they're using.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.446
Costs $4 billion
to deploy.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.481
Modeled after mine but with
no filters, no automation.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.201
Ingested everything.
They were drowning in data.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.930
It was a fucking disaster.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.890
Okay, but there must have been
some bigger picture, right?

23:07.960 --> 23:11.282
I mean, spending that kind of money?
They're not stupid.

23:11.360 --> 23:14.011
You would think intelligence
would count for something

23:14.120 --> 23:15.963
in the intelligence
business.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.448
Right. But you wanna
know what it really is?

23:19.520 --> 23:21.727
What really sets
the agenda?

23:22.720 --> 23:27.123
Military industrial
happiness management.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.042
You keep the coffers
open in Congress,

23:30.120 --> 23:33.283
you keep the money flowing
to the contractors.

23:33.360 --> 23:37.081
Efficiency, results?
They go out the window.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.526
Not to mention...
All right.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.126
Well, you're late
for class.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.643
Okay. Thank you.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.801
Can I take another one?
Sure.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.411
Did you ever say
anything to anybody?

24:00.480 --> 24:04.610
Yeah. I went to legal.
We filed complaints.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.526
Now here I am,
tucked away, teaching you.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.766
Maybe that's more important,
in the long run.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.687
You're getting better.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.528
My favorite spot
on campus.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.610
You hunt, Ed?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.085
Uh...

24:40.920 --> 24:43.491
Did some skeet shooting
with my dad a few times,

24:43.560 --> 24:45.324
but, no,
I never went hunting.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.606
We'll go one day.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.920
That'd be great.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.964
Mr. O'Brian,
can I ask you a question?

24:51.040 --> 24:52.804
How about just
calling me Corbin?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.721
Okay.
Thank you, sir. Uh, Corbin.

24:57.680 --> 25:02.208
I was talking with Hank
Forrester and I wanted to know,

25:02.280 --> 25:06.171
are all of our SIGINT programs
specifically targeted?

25:06.920 --> 25:10.720
Of course. What good would
they be if they weren't? Hmm?

25:12.160 --> 25:13.571
Yeah, I don't know.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.683
You have a girlfriend, Ed?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.530
Uh, nothing serious.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.045
What's her name?
Lindsay.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.167
Lindsay.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.010
She going with you?

25:27.800 --> 25:30.644
No, I wouldn't want
to put her in any danger.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.801
Well, you won't have to.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.288
We're not sending you
to the Middle East.

25:39.600 --> 25:44.128
Sir, I'm your best student.
Doesn't that count for something?

25:44.960 --> 25:49.409
In 20 years, Iraq will be a
hellhole nobody cares about.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.528
Terrorism's
a short-term threat.

25:51.600 --> 25:56.128
The real threats will come
from China, Russia, Iran,

25:56.240 --> 25:59.050
and they'll come as
SQL injections and malware.

25:59.160 --> 26:03.245
Without minds like yours, this country
will be torn apart in cyberspace.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.485
I don't want to risk
losing you

26:05.600 --> 26:08.331
for some horseshit war
over sand and oil.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.849
Sir, I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.288
You don't have to agree with your
politicians to be a patriot.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.800
Sir, where are you sending me?
Take a moment.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.851
Enjoy the view.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.921
HEY-

26:46.640 --> 26:47.846
This is Laura.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.481
Hello.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.050
Hello,
nice to meet you.

26:51.880 --> 26:55.009
Hello, I'm Ewen MacAskill from the Guardian.
It's nice to meet you.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.286
Nice to meet you, too.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.887
Um, if you don't mind, uh,
I'd like to record some of...

26:59.960 --> 27:02.327
Uh... Cell phones go
in the microwave.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.801
Dare I ask why?

27:03.880 --> 27:06.326
We'll get to that.
After you ask your questions.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.481
Yeah, before...

27:08.560 --> 27:10.642
Before we get on to the stories,
I need to know more about you.

27:10.720 --> 27:15.123
Your career by Glenn's account
is very varied,

27:15.200 --> 27:16.884
but the Guardian
needs evidence that...

27:16.960 --> 27:20.009
Yeah. This is my diplomatic
passport for friendly countries,

27:20.080 --> 27:21.969
my tourist passport
for everywhere else.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.451
You can check
the visa stamps.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.570
This is my NSA badge with Booz
Allen, my CIA badge with Dell,

27:27.640 --> 27:30.723
and this is my DIA
instructor's badge.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.724
This is a photo of me
with Michael Hayden,

27:33.880 --> 27:36.724
who's a former head
of the NSA and the CIA.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.166
When can you publish?

27:40.400 --> 27:43.643
Okay, um, do you mind if I sit down?
No, please.

27:43.920 --> 27:48.209
Uh, Glenn says
you want to, uh...

27:48.440 --> 27:50.249
You want to tell people
your identity.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.924
How do you think your
government's going to react?

27:52.200 --> 27:54.601
Well, they'll charge me
under the Espionage Act.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.411
And they'll say I endangered
national security,

27:57.480 --> 28:00.165
and they'll demonize me,
and my friends and family.

28:00.280 --> 28:03.011
And they'll throw me in jail.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.128
That's the
best-case scenario.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.526
And the worst?

28:06.600 --> 28:08.807
Well, if I don't
have any media cover,

28:08.880 --> 28:11.486
then I'll be rendered
by the CIA

28:11.560 --> 28:13.927
and interrogated
outside of the law.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.651
And they have a station
right up the street.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.121
But how would they
know what you did?

28:19.200 --> 28:22.761
Because I left a digital footprint in
my logs, so they'll figure it out.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.808
I did not want
a manhunt.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.042
I know what they would
do to my colleagues.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.164
Look, Mr. MacAskill, uh,

28:31.240 --> 28:34.847
this is not about money
or anything for me.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.160
There's no hidden agenda.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.040
I just wanted to get this data to
established journalists like yourselves,

28:40.120 --> 28:42.361
so that you can present it
to the world,

28:42.440 --> 28:45.967
and the people can decide
either I'm wrong

28:46.960 --> 28:50.885
or there's something going on inside
the government that's really wrong.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.727
So...

28:58.280 --> 29:01.011
This one
is everything I have

29:01.080 --> 29:04.004
on your British
intelligence agency, the GCHQ.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.048
An encryption key
will follow.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.726
You're gonna want your technical
people at the Guardian

29:09.800 --> 29:11.006
to look through
that thoroughly.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.003
There's a lot
of stuff there.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.525
Listen,
they're gonna investigate,

29:17.640 --> 29:20.610
and they're gonna
figure out what I've done.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.803
And then they're
gonna come for me.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.450
And now that
we've made contact,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.009
they're gonna come
for all of you, too.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.766
Uh... Um...

29:37.280 --> 29:38.930
Do you mind if I go
look in the microwave?

29:48.120 --> 29:51.249
Ewen. I'm on with Stuart.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.367
Hi, Ewen.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.328
Hi, Stuart. Look,
I've got one thing to say.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.921
- The Guinness here is great.
- Wonderful...

29:59.000 --> 30:01.128
Oh, absolutely
the genuine article.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.326
Good.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.846
But shockingly different
from what you'd expect.

30:05.400 --> 30:10.645
So... Now we have the lawyers
to deal with. And no doubt the White House.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.441
I got the go ahead.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.806
That's great.
Oh, good.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.644
Let's get started. We have
a lot to go through here,

30:16.720 --> 30:18.051
and it's not easy reading.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.929
We can start
by showing him XKeyscore.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.321
Good idea. Ed, can you bring it
up again and walk us through it?

30:22.400 --> 30:23.481
Yeah.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.243
Do we all get
under there now?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.601
He's protecting his passwords.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.887
Okay. So...

30:41.200 --> 30:43.931
This was introduced

30:44.000 --> 30:48.528
during my first deployment
at the CIA in Geneva.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.726
"XKeyscore."

30:51.280 --> 30:52.611
What does that do?

30:52.920 --> 30:55.764
It's like
a search interface.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.084
What does it search for?

30:59.360 --> 31:00.964
Anything you want.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.009
What was your
assignment in Geneva?

31:04.400 --> 31:09.281
Well, I was assigned with
diplomatic cover to the UN mission

31:09.360 --> 31:11.931
to maintain the CIA's
computer security network.

31:16.200 --> 31:20.205
I spent almost two years
around CIA field officers.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.001
I don't see a time
stamp on any of this.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.650
We have
a confirmation on the GSS.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.686
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't understand.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.331
Sherman says you hacked
the Human Resources site.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.249
Yeah, it's my job
to find flaws.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.006
The security of the HR site
is not your problem.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.650
You went outside
the wheelhouse.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.166
Okay, but just to clarify,
I did not hack it,

31:42.320 --> 31:44.721
I showed that it
could be hacked.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.126
You told me
to find a patch.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.361
You have that
in writing?

31:47.440 --> 31:50.649
Yes, I do. Remember, I sent
you the proof of concept.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.006
Doesn't matter
what you did, Snowden.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.686
Right or wrong, you need to let these
things be someone else's problem.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.604
He's also put
a derog in your file.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.091
Excuse me?
Let that be a lesson.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.525
I don't want him
calling me again

32:02.600 --> 32:04.329
about another
Ed Snowden moment.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.811
Okay?

32:10.160 --> 32:11.844
Why don't you take it easy
the rest of the day?

32:11.920 --> 32:13.763
Go work on
the scrubbing pile.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.364
That didn't look
like it went well.

32:21.440 --> 32:26.731
Oh, hey, man. Uh, yeah. No, I just
got a derog for doing my job.

32:26.840 --> 32:30.401
Politics, man. The
culture of fear wins again.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.887
I can't get anything done here.
Yeah.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.961
Hey, um, what about that idea
that we were talking about?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.644
I'm working on it.
I'm waiting for a call back

32:38.720 --> 32:40.210
from our friend
at The Hill.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.004
Who, Corbin? You called Corbin?
Hmm.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.445
You think he can
do something?

32:43.520 --> 32:46.524
We'll see. Maybe some limited
field ops under my supervision.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.125
Yes, that would be amazing.
I would love...

32:48.200 --> 32:51.966
Easy, Ed. I've gotta see a cleric in Milan.
We'll talk after.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.883
Okay. Thank you.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.801
Damn, CIA does not like
to leave a trace, huh?

33:14.880 --> 33:15.881
Can I help you?

33:15.960 --> 33:17.689
You get curious
to check one out?

33:18.160 --> 33:20.288
See what kind of crazy-ass
covert kill mission

33:20.360 --> 33:21.441
you might be erasing
from history?

33:21.560 --> 33:22.641
I'm sorry,
who are you with?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.446
No Such Agency.
I'm Gabriel Sol.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.848
I'm the 50-pound brain from the
Council of Wizards and Warlocks.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.641
Excuse me?

33:30.720 --> 33:32.927
Oh. Giving you your Intel
for Bucharest, dude.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.923
Unless there's
another Dave Churchyard.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.651
No. That's me.
Right this way.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.281
I'll be right outside.
Stay if you want.

33:44.360 --> 33:48.888
Uh, I don't have
authorization to use NSA programs.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.041
Well, if you're
the messenger to Bucharest,

33:50.120 --> 33:51.531
you must have
a PRIVAC clearance

33:51.600 --> 33:53.250
to see the finished
Intel, yes?

33:54.080 --> 33:55.047
Yeah...

33:55.120 --> 33:56.281
Yeah, so what
difference does it make

33:56.360 --> 33:57.600
if you see how
it's put together?

34:00.240 --> 34:01.810
Well, it's up to you, man.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.328
Uh, you're giving me
just names?

34:09.440 --> 34:10.965
Uh, and a lot more
than names.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.449
What I will be providing you and the
fine gentlemen of the Secret Service

34:14.520 --> 34:19.401
is a list of every threat made about
the President since February 3rd.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.960
And a profile of
every threat-maker.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.885
And these are, like,
existing targets?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.163
99% are gonna come from the
bulk collection program, so...

34:30.320 --> 34:32.129
Upstream, Muscular,
Tempora, PRISM.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.001
PRISM?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.843
You got a little
Snow White in you.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.203
Which makes me feel like the witch
bringing you a poisoned apple.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.601
Here. Exhibit A.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.889
Oakland resident Justin Pinsky
posted on a message board,

34:47.960 --> 34:50.725
"Romania has a storied history
of executing their leaders,

34:50.800 --> 34:53.644
"couldn't they do us a solid
and take out Bush?"

34:54.760 --> 34:57.525
Now this looks juicy.
This is from a G-chat.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.842
"...with the biggest python
you've ever seen." Hmm.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.363
How is this all possible?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.442
Um, keyword selectors.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.682
"Attack," "take out Bush."

35:12.480 --> 35:14.050
So think of it as
a Google search,

35:14.120 --> 35:16.088
except instead of searching
only what people make public,

35:16.160 --> 35:18.367
we're also looking at
everything they don't. So...

35:18.880 --> 35:20.769
Emails, chats,
SMS, whatever.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.524
Yeah, but which people?

35:23.800 --> 35:25.564
The whole kingdom,
Snow White.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.484
Which ambassador
was he again?

35:34.560 --> 35:37.131
De La Hoya, with
World Trade Organization.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.326
Right.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.161
So...

35:53.920 --> 35:55.604
O'Brian came through
for you.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.401
He agrees your talents are being wasted.
You ready for a little action?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.771
Really? What,
you mean right here?

36:03.240 --> 36:05.163
Yeah. Now.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.322
See the woman in
the pink number?

36:07.400 --> 36:12.167
Credit Suisse. J.P. Morgan's on her arm.
Grandma's with Deutsche Bank.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.083
Ten thousand bankers
in this town.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.083
All you need to turn is one.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.284
Socialize. Meet a few.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.091
Preferably ones sitting on
a pile of dirty Saudi money

36:21.160 --> 36:22.571
that's funding bin Laden.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.923
Thank you very much. Church.
Church. Sure. Churchyard.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.531
Mr. Debrinin asks
your business card, please.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.281
An ambassador. Wow!

36:39.480 --> 36:41.369
I wish I had your
schmoozing skills.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.283
Uh, well,
that's why you have me.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.131
Yeah. You don't know any
bankers, do you? Bankers?

36:46.960 --> 36:49.440
Are you on some kind of
assignment or something?

36:50.960 --> 36:55.249
Um, "Relationship cultivating."
And not well.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.046
Let me help you.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.246
No.
Yeah.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.841
No, this is serious.
I know it's serious.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.161
Trust me.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.486
Any luck?

37:06.800 --> 37:08.006
No, no bites.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.841
Is there some kind
of trick to it?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.801
It's all about finding
the pressure point.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.968
Everything else is
just pushing on it.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.170
Looks like
you're being summoned.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.691
...we have to pay extra...
Marwan? May I interrupt?

37:28.760 --> 37:29.921
This is
my boyfriend, Dave.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.526
Hello, Dave. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.681
Marwan works at Monfort.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.240
We were talking,
and after last week,

37:37.320 --> 37:39.129
he may be able
to give you some tips.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.771
Gentlemen, I'll see you inside.
Last week?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.683
He's embarrassed. It was
a lot of money for us.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.241
Day trading is a perilous sport.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.727
You shouldn't be ashamed of it.
Yeah.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.125
I'm gonna grab some food.
See you guys inside?

37:57.200 --> 37:58.326
Sure.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.480
You have a lovely girlfriend.
Thank you so much.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.568
You know, I work in IT,
and so I just figured

38:05.720 --> 38:08.405
I could crack the market
like a weak network.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.603
May I ask, how precipitous
were your losses?

38:12.840 --> 38:15.491
Well, I told Lindsay
it was 20,000,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.404
but between you and me,
it was closer to 45.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.647
Tried to recoup,
but that was a mistake,

38:22.720 --> 38:24.324
and now without
any real grounding,

38:24.400 --> 38:25.970
I feel like I'm just
sliding out of control.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.929
Oh, I have seen it
many times.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.809
And I'm always happy
to help a man

38:29.880 --> 38:32.167
break a bad habit
before it gets going.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.083
Oh, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.165
This is the cleanest
Pakistani I've ever seen.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.402
We got no first-degree ties
to government or ISI,

38:41.480 --> 38:42.925
no shady family.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.650
I mean, second-degree contacts
are off the charts,

38:45.760 --> 38:47.330
but that's... I mean, that's
everyone in the Middle East

38:47.400 --> 38:48.686
with a six-figure income.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.526
Well, it's not dirt that we need
necessarily, it's a pressure point.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.769
Something intimate,
some kind of weakness.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.123
Can we look through his family?
Mmm-hmm.

38:59.840 --> 39:03.606
How about
his sister-in-law?

39:04.880 --> 39:05.927
Yeah.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.808
What is that, is that some
video that she sent somebody?

39:11.880 --> 39:14.281
No, this is live.
Out of Paris.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.766
What do you mean, live?

39:16.600 --> 39:19.570
Optic Nerve. It's
camera and mic activation.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.722
I wish we could take credit,
but the Brits wrote it.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.165
Activation?

39:23.240 --> 39:25.163
Yeah,
her laptop's off.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.890
Or was, she just
forgot to close it.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.007
Of course,
how would she know?

39:28.080 --> 39:30.606
This shit is so sly, the webcam
light doesn't even turn on.

39:38.160 --> 39:41.209
Hmm. I always wondered
what was under those.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.206
Okay, look, let's stick
to family in Geneva.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.726
All right?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.802
Okay, Snow White.
Uh...

39:55.640 --> 39:58.325
Fifteen-year-old daughter
at the International School.

39:58.400 --> 40:02.724
Yeah. Uh, Facebook?
Is that possible?

40:02.800 --> 40:04.484
Dude,
Facebook's my bitch.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.050
Seriously?

40:06.320 --> 40:09.483
Like, she fights
with her parents, or...

40:09.560 --> 40:12.882
Don't worry, don't worry. I know all
the hooks for this kind of fishing.

40:13.480 --> 40:17.326
Uh, query name. So email, keyword,
whatever selector you want.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.163
And justification
is where I write...

40:23.440 --> 40:26.569
In other words, turning your
daddy into a CIA informant.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.808
Wait, that's it? That's it, bro.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.490
You don't have to get
a FISA court order?

40:32.920 --> 40:35.446
Mmm-mmm. No, not here.
XKeyscore's under 702 authority,

40:35.520 --> 40:37.363
which means no warrants.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.127
Okay, but U.S. targets then, you'd
have to get the court order?

40:41.200 --> 40:44.727
You mean FISA? Yeah, they're just
a big-ass rubber stamp, dude.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.484
I mean, FISA judges
are all appointed by

40:46.560 --> 40:49.166
the Chief Justice,
who's like, you know...

40:50.480 --> 40:53.245
Darth Vader when it comes
to national security. Boom.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.205
Here we go.

40:57.240 --> 41:02.690
Okay, okay. And the boy
at third base is...

41:04.880 --> 41:10.046
Nadim. Okay. He's 18.

41:11.360 --> 41:12.441
Salma says she wants
to marry him,

41:12.520 --> 41:14.329
but is scared of
telling her parents.

41:14.480 --> 41:19.725
What she doesn't know is that
his other name is Nicolas.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.567
And he's currently banging
Geraldine and Julie.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.681
And...

41:31.520 --> 41:33.602
He and his Turkish mother
are here illegally.

41:38.920 --> 41:39.967
That's it.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.528
Ah, you like that?

41:50.600 --> 41:52.125
I love these.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.925
Man, what are
we doing here?

41:57.440 --> 41:59.807
You're making people
very happy.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.406
Mr. Marwan's bank
handles serious Saudi money,

42:02.480 --> 42:04.767
and a whole bunch of
Russian billionaires.

42:04.840 --> 42:09.084
What about any Al-Qaeda money?
Anything promising?

42:10.440 --> 42:12.681
Ed, I'm up for
a promotion soon.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.643
I will not forget
my friends.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.771
Thank you.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.370
This is all going kind of
fast though, right?

42:18.440 --> 42:20.363
I mean, I just sent
some initial background.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.602
There he is!
The man!

42:22.680 --> 42:23.920
Hey, Marwan!

42:24.000 --> 42:27.163
Dave. How wonderful
to see you.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.526
Good to see you, too.

42:28.640 --> 42:33.441
Uh, I was counting, Marwan, you snuck
in an extra half hour back there.

42:33.520 --> 42:37.366
I'm afraid she was merely
listening to an old man's woes.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.441
Oh, I see.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.363
So, how are you,
Marwan?

42:42.600 --> 42:46.047
I must tell you,
Dave, since we met,

42:46.800 --> 42:50.009
my life has gone
somewhat Topsy-turvy.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.163
Oh, no,
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.244
But your colleague
Charles here

42:55.320 --> 42:57.527
has graciously
offered his help.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.921
So I owe him and you
a great deal.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.729
Can I ask
what happened?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.926
My daughter had an...

43:06.000 --> 43:08.970
Marwan's daughter
took too many sleeping pills.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.644
She's all right.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.644
It had something to do with her
boyfriend, who was recently deported.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.643
We're trying to secure
a visa for him.

43:15.720 --> 43:19.202
And even so,
I'm afraid that Salma will...

43:21.200 --> 43:23.601
I'm sorry. I won't trouble
you with such matters.

43:23.680 --> 43:27.526
No, no, you... Hey. You
talk as much as you want.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.285
All right?
Family comes first.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.160
Whoa!
Oh!

43:43.040 --> 43:44.246
There's my beauty.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.164
I'm never
like this before.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.083
Oh, sure.
No, of course.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.322
You sit down, huh?
Sit tight.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.884
You sit tight.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.485
What the fuck's
going on?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.528
I have been acting
swiftly and effectively

44:02.600 --> 44:05.649
on the very good signals
intelligence you've provided.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.167
And if his daughter
had died?

44:08.240 --> 44:10.004
We could have
used that too.

44:10.080 --> 44:12.162
Are you serious? What, in
the name of a promotion?

44:15.240 --> 44:18.687
Marwan can't be away
from his family right now.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.007
So in the morning, when
he's facing a week in jail,

44:21.080 --> 44:24.163
we're going to offer him a deal
and he won't turn it down.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.401
Wait, jail? For what?

44:26.400 --> 44:27.561
Drunk driving.

44:27.640 --> 44:30.007
Now, I want you
to call the police.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.320
Tell 'em you saw
a Mercedes headed north...

44:31.400 --> 44:32.640
No, he's not driving
right now.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.529
Look at him,
he'll kill himself.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.443
Okay. I'll call 'em.
Hey!

44:40.920 --> 44:42.081
He's not driving.

44:43.120 --> 44:46.920
Remind me, are you authorized on
any of the NSA programs you used?

44:49.280 --> 44:51.248
So we're both doing a little
fucked up shit here, huh?

44:52.720 --> 44:55.087
Watch yourself, Ed. I will
tell him who you are.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.365
You reveal the identity
of an undercover officer,

44:59.440 --> 45:02.125
you're going to jail
for a lot longer than Marwan.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.441
Hey!

45:23.160 --> 45:24.286
HEY-

45:24.840 --> 45:26.171
Sorry I'm so late.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.291
How was work?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.091
It was, uh...

45:35.840 --> 45:38.161
It was all right. Yeah.

45:39.560 --> 45:42.803
I have to
wake up in, like, three hours.

45:42.880 --> 45:44.325
My flight's at 7:00.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.648
Well, we'd better
be quick, then.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.848
I will provide our intelligence
and law enforcement agencies

46:38.920 --> 46:41.730
with the tools they need to track
and take out the terrorists

46:41.840 --> 46:44.810
without undermining our
constitution and our freedom.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.484
That means no
more illegal wiretapping

46:47.560 --> 46:48.800
of American citizens.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.168
No more ignoring the law
when it is inconvenient.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.651
That is not who we are.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.320
Hey, hon.
Hey.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.530
What happened
to the London trip?

46:58.640 --> 47:00.483
Uh...

47:00.960 --> 47:02.405
Turns out I'm not going.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.521
Oh.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.043
What's going on?
Who's winning?

47:08.120 --> 47:10.202
...and Michelle Obama
voted this morning in Chicago.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.725
- I voted.
- In Arizona...

47:11.920 --> 47:13.046
Still early.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.248
...John and Cindy McCain voted,
and then they landed in Colorado

47:15.360 --> 47:17.169
to defend a traditionally
Republican state

47:17.240 --> 47:18.685
that has turned
into a battleground.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.761
Hey. Let's see.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.409
Obama ahead 67%
to 32%...

47:23.480 --> 47:26.609
Come on, big ears.
Check out Florida.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.888
Holy shit, he's gonna win it!

47:34.280 --> 47:36.362
What, Florida?
Yeah!

47:36.440 --> 47:38.442
That's big. Yeah.
It's huge!

47:40.120 --> 47:43.522
You can act all nonchalant, but I know
you were starting to root for him.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.323
I've been watching
your inner liberal grow.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.562
For which I will take a modest
percentage of the credit.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.688
And you deserve it.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.287
What is this?

47:55.360 --> 47:56.600
...in Missouri.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.366
56% for McCain,
43% for Obama.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.962
Oh, yeah, that. Just... Leave that there.
That's, uh...

48:04.480 --> 48:07.051
Russian hackers.
The Agency says

48:07.120 --> 48:09.691
they can activate
webcams now. So...

48:09.760 --> 48:10.761
That's creepy.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.081
Yes. It's really
bothering me.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.721
Whatever. It's not a big deal.
You shouldn't let it bother you.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.569
It's not a big deal? No.

48:18.640 --> 48:21.007
What, that someone could
be watching you right now?

48:21.600 --> 48:24.285
No, I'm not
hiding anything.

48:25.400 --> 48:29.007
That's such
a bullshit line. What is?

48:29.120 --> 48:31.521
I have nothing to hide. I don't.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.806
Everyone does.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.881
Okay, well then,
what do I have to hide?

48:36.640 --> 48:38.722
Forget it. No,
what do I have to hide?

48:38.800 --> 48:40.643
No, never...
Let's just drop it.

48:40.720 --> 48:44.042
Well, apparently you think that I'm
hiding something, so...

48:44.120 --> 48:46.566
Okay, the other day,
your computer was open,

48:46.640 --> 48:49.450
and I happened to notice you
were on the site where we met,

48:49.520 --> 48:50.760
and you were looking
at other guys.

48:50.840 --> 48:53.002
You just were looking
at my computer?

48:53.840 --> 48:55.171
I wouldn't have
even brought this up.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.242
You asked me,
"What do I have to hide?"

48:57.320 --> 48:59.322
That's something
you're not telling me.

49:01.200 --> 49:05.762
Well, it's not...
I don't do anything,

49:05.880 --> 49:08.087
I don't meet any
of those people.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.810
You're gone for weeks
at a time.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.366
So it's like I'm peering
into other peoples' lives

49:15.480 --> 49:17.482
because my own is
just temporarily on hold.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.051
That sounds like
an excuse.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.366
It's the truth.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.367
I should have told you.
And I didn't.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.081
I'm really sorry.
But it's not a big deal.

49:50.920 --> 49:51.921
HEY-

50:01.080 --> 50:04.641
Look at me.
I don't want anyone else.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.164
I don't want
any other life.

50:09.760 --> 50:10.807
Okay?

50:25.520 --> 50:26.965
Listen, uh...

50:29.200 --> 50:32.522
I didn't go to London today
'cause I resigned.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.761
What?

50:36.160 --> 50:38.003
It was personal differences,

50:38.080 --> 50:40.162
and it was a matter
of principle.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.884
Can you tell me
anything else?

50:46.600 --> 50:47.931
Do you get
reposted, or...

50:48.000 --> 50:50.651
No, no, I resigned
from the CIA.

50:52.160 --> 50:54.162
So what does
that mean? What do we do?

50:54.280 --> 50:57.682
I don't know. I'll figure
it out, but listen, I...

51:00.240 --> 51:03.608
This is a good thing.
Trust me.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.486
I do.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.850
Hmm?
Hey.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.441
He's gonna win.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.610
52% for Obama,
48% for McCain.

51:26.680 --> 51:27.886
Yeah, he'd better.

51:29.160 --> 51:33.085
CNN can now project that
Barack Obama, 47 years old,

51:33.160 --> 51:35.891
will become the President of the
United States-

51:36.480 --> 51:39.962
Every agency and department
should know that this administration

51:40.040 --> 51:41.326
stands on the side

51:41.400 --> 51:43.528
not of those who seek
to withhold information,

51:43.600 --> 51:45.443
but those who seek
to make it known.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.963
Janine is
the website editor

51:50.040 --> 51:53.010
of a small stateside office
of a British newspaper,

51:53.080 --> 51:55.606
up against the most powerful
government in the world.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.966
She won't be bullied.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.408
We need to establish
that we're not compromising

51:59.480 --> 52:01.323
national security
by publishing.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.970
We need
to have alternatives.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.371
Listen, Ed,

52:04.440 --> 52:06.841
the real issue here is that
they, the White House,

52:06.920 --> 52:10.208
are aware that Janine has a leaked
top secret FISA court order.

52:10.280 --> 52:11.486
Anything could happen.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.971
They could subpoena
the Guardian

52:13.040 --> 52:14.121
and, for that matter,
they could

52:14.200 --> 52:15.565
break through
that door any minute,

52:15.640 --> 52:17.608
ending all of this.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.887
We are running
out of time.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.043
We seriously have to think about
doing this on our own website.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.446
We have no choice.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.329
Wait, you can't just
start dumping articles

52:26.440 --> 52:28.249
on the Internet, Glenn!
Be serious.

52:28.320 --> 52:31.005
Look at WikiLeaks. It
destroyed their credibility.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.650
Look,Ed,
you said it yourself,

52:32.720 --> 52:36.167
if this isn't done properly, the
world isn't gonna take notice.

52:36.240 --> 52:39.608
You need experienced
journalists to lead the public

52:39.680 --> 52:42.160
through some very,
very complicated stories.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.765
We are
experienced journalists.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.685
My feeling...

52:52.960 --> 52:56.169
Has anyone called here before? Not once.
Not in three weeks.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.844
Well, I'll...
Shall I answer it?

52:57.960 --> 52:59.610
I'll tell 'em it's
the wrong number.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.441
Yes?

53:03.920 --> 53:05.365
No, I don't.

53:06.960 --> 53:08.450
Okay. Thank you.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.203
Asking if I want
turndown service.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.760
She said the "Do not disturb"
sign was off the door.

53:33.880 --> 53:35.041
So?

53:36.240 --> 53:39.323
Do we wait?
Or go on our own?

53:41.040 --> 53:42.201
Look, I said
from the beginning

53:42.320 --> 53:45.324
that how you publish
is your business,

53:45.400 --> 53:47.164
and I trust you.

53:47.240 --> 53:49.971
The only thing I ask is you study
the data, you be responsible,

53:50.080 --> 53:52.731
no names, no specifics,
anything ongoing

53:52.800 --> 53:54.962
that's critical,
you don't release.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.441
You just stick to the issue
of mass surveillance

53:57.520 --> 53:58.567
and let the people decide.

53:58.640 --> 54:01.723
You have our word on that, but
that's not the question. We have to ask...

54:01.840 --> 54:03.490
Look, Ed, Ed,

54:03.560 --> 54:05.961
right now the White House is
arranging a conference call

54:06.040 --> 54:08.122
between Janine and
the intelligence services.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.283
Now that's gonna happen
in a few hours.

54:11.360 --> 54:15.251
Let's at least wait for that,
see what they say to her.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.888
I'd say we pause a moment.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.571
Yeah, I think
we should reassemble

54:24.640 --> 54:26.085
in this room after
the call takes place,

54:26.200 --> 54:29.841
so that's around midnight.
Be noon in New York.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.125
All right.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.521
I'll take another pass at the
PRISM story in the meantime.

54:34.600 --> 54:38.491
Okay. We'll be in our hotel
room if you need us, okay?

54:38.560 --> 54:39.561
Thanks, Ewen.

54:39.640 --> 54:40.801
Yeah.
Okay.

54:48.400 --> 54:51.210
Uh, do you mind maybe
we take a break from that?

54:51.520 --> 54:53.090
For a second?

54:54.360 --> 54:56.681
Oh, yeah. Sure, sorry.

54:56.840 --> 55:00.208
You wanna take a look?
Might make you feel better.

55:00.400 --> 55:03.051
On. It's not
recording, just on standby.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.485
Okay.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.486
When did this start for you?
Not wanting your photo taken?

55:10.760 --> 55:13.161
Uh, probably in Japan.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.720
I remember every time
a camera got pointed at me,

55:15.800 --> 55:18.167
it was like...
Couldn't breathe.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.605
Why was that?

55:21.080 --> 55:25.449
I probably, uh, spent too much time
looking at other people through cameras.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.881
Japan was your
first NSA job, right?

55:28.960 --> 55:33.921
Yeah, well, as a contractor with Dell.
Had a lot of access.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.402
Why'd you go
back after Geneva?

55:39.520 --> 55:43.161
'Cause the money, and 'cause
I wanted to live in Japan.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.004
And because of Obama,
actually.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.731
You know, I thought things were
gonna get better with him.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.491
I was wrong.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.201
What was it like there?

56:00.280 --> 56:02.248
Well,
in the first part of my day,

56:02.320 --> 56:06.530
I was building this round-the-clock
backup system called Epic Shelter.

56:06.600 --> 56:09.126
So, if there was
some catastrophe,

56:09.200 --> 56:12.090
say, uh, terrorists
burned down every embassy

56:12.160 --> 56:14.731
and NSA post in
the Middle East.

56:14.800 --> 56:19.488
This program would ensure we
wouldn't lose any of that data.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.566
But then, I would have to put it
aside when visitors would show up.

56:23.640 --> 56:24.641
Hi, Ed.

56:24.720 --> 56:29.521
NSA wanted to impress the
Japanese, show them our reach.

56:30.480 --> 56:33.245
They loved
the live drone feeds.

56:33.320 --> 56:35.482
This is over Pakistan.

56:36.400 --> 56:37.731
Right now.

56:40.480 --> 56:44.007
They were not as thrilled to
learn that we wanted them to help us

56:44.080 --> 56:46.208
spy on
the Japanese population.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.085
They said it was
against their laws.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.402
Course we tapped
the entire country anyway.

56:54.360 --> 56:56.328
And we didn't stop there,

56:56.400 --> 56:58.562
'cause once we owned
their communications systems,

56:58.640 --> 57:01.564
we started going after
their physical infrastructure.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.929
We'd slip these little sleeper
programs into power grids,

57:06.000 --> 57:07.968
dams, hospitals,

57:08.040 --> 57:10.122
and the idea was
if the day came

57:10.200 --> 57:12.601
when Japan was
no longer an ally,

57:12.680 --> 57:14.011
it'd be lights out.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.486
And it wasn't
just the Japanese.

57:18.560 --> 57:22.087
We were planting malware
in Mexico, Germany,

57:22.160 --> 57:23.844
Brazil, Austria.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.927
I mean, China I can understand,
or Russia, or Iran,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.685
or Venezuela, okay.
But Austria?

57:33.440 --> 57:36.489
You're also being ordered
to follow most world leaders

57:36.560 --> 57:38.164
and heads of industry.

57:38.240 --> 57:41.562
You know, you're tracking
trade deals, sex scandals,

57:41.880 --> 57:44.565
diplomatic cables
to give the U.S.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.120
an advantage in
negotiations at the G8,

57:47.200 --> 57:50.807
or leverage over
Brazilian oil companies,

57:50.880 --> 57:55.044
or helping to oust some third-world
leader who's not playing ball.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.641
And ultimately,
the truth sinks in

57:58.720 --> 58:01.564
that no matter what justification
you're selling yourself,

58:01.640 --> 58:03.927
this is not about terrorism.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.289
Terrorism is the excuse.

58:10.240 --> 58:14.962
This is about economic
and social control.

58:16.560 --> 58:19.086
And the only thing
you're really protecting

58:19.160 --> 58:21.561
is the supremacy
of your government.

58:30.840 --> 58:34.003
Were you thinking about
going to journalists then?

58:34.080 --> 58:37.050
No. No, that wouldn't have
occurred to me back then.

58:38.640 --> 58:42.690
I just thought, you know,
the system will self-correct,

58:42.760 --> 58:46.287
and the President will keep his
promise that got him elected...

58:48.440 --> 58:52.206
That's actually when I first started
reading about you and your films.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.361
It was in Glenn's blog.

58:53.440 --> 58:56.523
You were being detained
in airports for hours.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.446
Thirty-seven times. For investigating
your own country's wars.

59:00.640 --> 59:05.123
That's why I'm going back to Berlin
to edit. You can trust me with this.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.802
I do. Yeah.

59:08.960 --> 59:12.726
I haven't trusted
anyone in years.

59:15.960 --> 59:21.569
It was a welcome change when they
put me on terrorism watch duty.

59:22.240 --> 59:25.926
Every day, I'd go in and I'd get
starting points for SIGINT,

59:26.040 --> 59:28.646
which is signals intelligence.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.926
A lot of them were American,
which felt strange,

59:34.000 --> 59:35.843
but you just keep
reminding yourself,

59:35.920 --> 59:39.925
I could stop a dirty bomb attack
and save thousands of lives.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.962
The thing is, you're not just
following your bad guy targets.

59:44.040 --> 59:46.611
You're also following
their metadata,

59:46.680 --> 59:50.685
which is basically all the phone
numbers that they're in touch with.

59:51.600 --> 59:55.321
Let's say your target
is a shady Iranian banker

59:55.400 --> 59:57.926
operating out of Beirut,
okay.

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.446
So you're watching his stuff,
but you're also watching

1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:02.966
all the people
that he talks to.

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:05.646
Including,
you know, his cousin,

1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:08.291
who's just some dentist
living in Buffalo.

1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:11.170
And then you have to watch
all of that guy's contacts.

1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:14.608
And by the time you go a third hop
out from the original target,

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:20.210
you're watching this bartender
chat with her mother about Botox.

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:25.286
'Cause three hops from anyone
with, say, 40 contacts,

1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:28.011
you're looking at a list
of 2.5 million people.

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:32.688
And there's that
moment when

1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:36.367
you're sitting there and
the scale of it hits you.

1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:41.128
The NSA is really tracking
every cell phone in the world.

1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:43.049
No matter who you are,

1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:45.811
every day of your life,
you're sitting in a database

1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:48.486
just ready
to be looked at.

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:04.683
And not just terrorists, or
countries, or corporations, but you.

1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:15.288
Was Lindsay with you
in Japan?

1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:20.687
Japan was difficult
for us.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.648
I guess you couldn't
talk about your work.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:27.330
No.

1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:32.561
There was this one night,
uh, towards the end,

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:37.170
when, uh, we were supposed to go
climb Mount Fuji the next day...

1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:45.481
Wow!

1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:49.880
Are you gonna
post that on Twitter?

1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:50.961
No.

1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:53.726
They're just for me.
What do you think?

1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:58.243
You should delete those.

1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:01.091
That's not quite the artistic
critique I was going for.

1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:03.044
I'm sorry. You just...
You should...

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:04.929
You can't have stuff like
that on your hard drive.

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.047
Yes, I can.

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:10.091
Can you just please... I'm
asking you, can you delete them?

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:12.171
Russian hackers again?

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:13.287
No...

1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:17.171
Is it us?

1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:21.086
It's classified.

1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:23.880
Am I a target?

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:25.200
Of course not.

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.767
Clearly someone is looking
at my nude portraits.

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:30.729
Okay. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:33.121
All right? It's issues
of national security.

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.362
Well, I am flattered
that my boobs

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:39.323
are considered an issue
of national security,

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:41.124
but you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:43.680
I'd rather not talk about stuff
that could land us in jail.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.524
So that's what
the Band-Aids are about, then?

1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.443
And your camera phobia?

1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:48.726
Because of work?

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:51.125
Are they watching us?

1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:53.490
Who are they watching?
No one, okay?

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.210
Let's just stop
talking about it.

1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:59.961
Let's go to bed,
and wake up in the morning,

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:03.647
and go climb this fucking mountain.
All right?

1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:06.091
Of course we're not
gonna talk about it.

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.486
What is that
supposed to mean?

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:10.040
It means that we don't talk
about anything anymore.

1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:13.366
You work 12-hour days,
you come home depressed,

1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:15.807
you play fucking video games,
and then you fall asleep.

1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:17.564
Yeah, I'm tired
'cause I have a job.

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.051
That's what pays
for this apartment

1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:20.849
in the most expensive city
in the world.

1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:24.163
Which you asked me to come to knowing
that I did not have a work visa.

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.480
Okay, what if
you had one?

1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:29.087
Would you really give up your
beautiful life of eating and sleeping

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:31.726
and going out all the time? You
think you'd really want a career?

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:35.168
A career like yours? Where I'm
miserable all the time? No.

1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:37.402
That's called
responsibility.

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.162
Fuck this.

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:42.083
You know what?
You have no fucking idea

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:44.845
what it's like to be accountable
for other people's lives,

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:47.002
because you live
in a fairy tale land

1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.003
where just there
are no consequences,

1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:50.684
and no one ever gets hurt.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:58.083
No. No,
you, you don't get hurt.

1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:00.931
I get
fucking crushed.

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:02.849
Fucking bullshit!
I've done nothing to you!

1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:04.888
That's exactly right.
You have done nothing!

1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:08.002
You don't hang out with me,
you don't laugh with me,

1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:10.924
you don't even
fucking touch me anymore.

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:14.400
I'm sorry.
Stop!

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.644
No!

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:32.127
We, uh, never made it to Mount Fuji.

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:37.281
And Lindsay left pretty
soon after that, and...

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.530
I was really lonely there.

1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:44.202
But after three months, I left too.
I went back to Maryland.

1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:14.244
And I promised her
I'd change.

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.083
And, uh, we moved
back in together.

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:18.491
Make
sure your knees stay bent,

1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:21.524
and then you can fully extend
once you feel stable. Ready?

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:23.648
One, two, three.

1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:25.321
All the way up.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:26.930
Now you wanna clench
between your knees.

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.446
It'll burn,
but it's a good burn.

1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:30.487
Perfect.

1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:32.005
Twirl around.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:35.841
Perfect! Oh, my
God, I'm so proud of you!

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:37.763
When you're really happy,

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:41.208
there's a large part of you
that just wants to stay happy.

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:48.523
And you start to think, what could
be more important than this?

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.205
What!
Is it okay?

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:54.048
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:59.645
You know, lots of people
cruise happily through life.

1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:02.730
Why can't I?

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:13.290
And I went back
to work at the CIA.

1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:15.044
With backdoors...

1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:17.885
My official title was
Solutions Consultant.

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:22.049
Basically I was hawking
overpriced hardware for a living.

1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:23.804
But I thought
you had resigned?

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:26.360
Yeah, well, it was all
contract work after Geneva.

1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:28.681
You know,
it's Booz Allen Hamilton,

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:30.888
or Dell, in partnership

1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:34.009
With CIA or NSA, DIA.

1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:38.645
That's the intelligence
community's revolving door.

1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:42.640
How was it?
Being back in the States?

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:46.681
It was, uh, it was
really good to be home.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.130
But Maryland was where things
started to turn for me.

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:58.568
Every time I felt like I was finally
letting go of all the anxiety

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:01.246
and all the questions that
used to keep me up at night,

1:07:01.320 --> 1:07:05.245
I'd learn something else,
and I just couldn't ignore it.

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:09.240
Like, there were these three
high-level officials at the NSA,

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:12.051
Bill Binney, Ed Loomis,
and Kirk Wiebe.

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:16.330
They'd been filing complaints about
abuse and overreach for years.

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:20.200
That's all they did,
they just filed complaints,

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:23.443
and the FBI
raided their homes.

1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:25.085
Then there was Thomas Drake.

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:27.128
Like the other three guys,
Drake was trying

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:29.487
to change things
from the inside.

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:31.961
But when nothing worked,
he did go to the press.

1:07:32.040 --> 1:07:35.965
So they hit him with the Espionage
Act, and we were shocked.

1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:37.963
The whole Intel community.

1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:39.371
Why do you
think you were charged?

1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:40.965
To send a chilling message.

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:42.361
To whom?

1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:45.011
To other whistleblowers,
to others in the government,

1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:47.202
not to speak out.

1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:51.330
Do not tell truth to power.
We'll hammer you.

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:55.571
There's a new
program being developed

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:58.007
at the NSA's op
center on Oahu.

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.561
You'd be going up against
Chinese cyber divisions.

1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:05.001
You interested?

1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:10.928
Won't be the vast sums of
money you're making now,

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.480
but you'd be performing a critical
service for your country.

1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:14.891
I know that's
important to you.

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.281
You mean service
like in Geneva?

1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:20.204
Matt was a mistake. Shouldn't
have pushed you into that.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:21.327
You didn't push me
into it.

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.528
I asked for exposure to field
ops, you gave it to me.

1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:25.329
I won't hold that
against you.

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.840
Is there something
you do hold against me?

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:35.206
You didn't tell me
we were running

1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:37.521
a dragnet on
the whole world, Corbin.

1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:02.400
Great shooting, Ed.

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:03.811
Thank you.

1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:05.850
That's terrific.

1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:08.721
It's the one thing
in the Army I was good at.

1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:16.449
You ever think, Ed,

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:21.367
since the Second World War, it's
been 60 years and still no WW III.

1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:23.406
Why?

1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:28.325
Because we've used our power
generally for the good of the world.

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:31.930
For prosperity, order.

1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:33.889
How can we defend
ourselves against

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:37.169
nuclear war, terror attacks,
cyber-attacks

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.641
without a centralized
Intel factory

1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:41.609
working around the world
night and day?

1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:45.244
So we should catalogue
billions of people's lives?

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:48.688
Most people already catalogue
their lives for public consumption.

1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:51.923
Well, they catalogue part cf their
lives, and they do it by choice.

1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:54.441
We're not giving them the choice.
We're just taking everything.

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:58.286
Most Americans don't want
freedom, they want security.

1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:00.690
It's a simple bargain. If...

1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:02.768
Good girl! Good girl!

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:05.364
If you want to play
with all the new toys

1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:08.410
and be safe, you pay
the price of admission.

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.651
Yeah, except people,

1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.484
they don't even know
they've made that bargain.

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:16.801
Where's the modern
battlefield, soldier?

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:19.641
Everywhere.

1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:22.361
What's
the first rule of battle?

1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:24.124
Never reveal
your position.

1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:29.881
And if one unauthorized person knew?
If Congress knew?

1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:31.724
So would the enemy.

1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:35.850
That, Mr. Snowden,
is the state of the world.

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:39.601
Secrecy is security,
and security is victory.

1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:48.890
Thank you, sir.

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:51.720
Someone I want you
to meet.

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.768
Beautiful day for it, wasn't it?
Perfect weather.

1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:56.320
Mr. Lowell. Jim.

1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:58.768
How are you?
Dorian.

1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:00.205
Alan.
Nice to see you.

1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:01.406
Welcome to the U.S.

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:03.050
How'd you make
out today, Corbin?

1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:05.970
Uh, very mediocre.
Nothing like Ed here.

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:09.404
Apparently the Army's training
people to shoot straight.

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:11.289
So this is Ed Snowden.

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:12.566
Yes, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:15.081
The brains behind Epic Shelter.
That's right.

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:16.446
That's brilliant work.
Thank you, sir.

1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:17.965
Yeah, I had a few questions
I wanted to ask you.

1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:20.884
Uh, Jim. Will you
excuse me, gentlemen?

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:22.731
Excuse me, Alan.
Nice to meet you.

1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:28.003
Yeah, it's proving very useful
to our UAV program.

1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:31.289
Yes, I heard. With foreign
site Intel transfer.

1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:32.964
Transfers happen
on collection now.

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:36.362
They go straight to the Pentagon,
Mossad if they need it.

1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:39.205
Actionable immediately.
No one sees it.

1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:40.646
It's improved
the response time

1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:42.609
of our drone pilots
by a factor of ten.

1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:46.647
Tell me, Ed. You worked signals
intelligence in Japan too, yes?

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:47.801
Yes, sir.

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:49.644
How'd you like it?

1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:53.247
It was a very empowering job, sir.

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:57.524
With this new job in Hawaii,
you'd have even more access.

1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:01.730
I asked Corbin to start the conversation.
But the offer is mine.

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:05.364
Take your time.

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:06.566
It's going to
take a few months

1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:08.961
to get this program
on its feet.

1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.691
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen, I see dinner.

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.609
Beer, sir?
Thank you.

1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:17.089
Sir, for you?
Uh, no, thank you.

1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:24.808
Epic Shelter was meant
as a backup program.

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:29.527
Lowell is creating
this position for you, Ed.

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:32.206
You'd be the first contractor
outside Fort Meade

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:33.930
working counter-cyber.

1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:37.202
It's your ticket to the top.

1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:49.964
Do
you believe the United States

1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:52.008
is the greatest country
in the world?

1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:53.730
Yes.

1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:56.241
Have you ever used

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.005
any programs
you were unauthorized for?

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:06.007
No.

1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:21.205
We're not usually
supposed to submit our own work,

1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:24.568
but my editor said
she'd make an exception.

1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:25.687
Pretty neat, huh?

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.162
I get to
submit an entry.

1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:38.966
You ignoring me
on purpose, or what?

1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:41.566
No. Sorry.
Shit. Uh...

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.367
I was just thinking.

1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:45.686
About what?

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:53.361
I wanted to talk to you
about it at dinner,

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:55.681
but let's just...
Will you come sit down?

1:13:57.160 --> 1:13:59.242
Is everything okay?

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:00.526
Yeah.

1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:02.800
Um...

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.531
The, uh, Deputy Director
of the NSA...

1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:09.090
Hmm?

1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:11.402
He offered me
a new position.

1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:14.530
And, uh, that was a while back,
and now they need an answer.

1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:17.882
Well, is it something
you want to do?

1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:21.089
I'd be good at it.

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:25.520
Can you tell me anything about it?

1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:27.564
You know I can't.

1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:30.484
I know. Mission first.

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:35.246
Well, are there social perks?
White House galas, maybe?

1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:39.445
The position
is in Hawaii.

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:50.290
We worked really hard
to get where we're at.

1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:54.963
And you're willing to
just rip it all up again?

1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:56.929
Like we finally have
a house that we love,

1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.843
and a job that I like,
and real friends,

1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:00.922
and we're close to our families.
I... I understand.

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.890
And if you want to stay,
then we're staying.

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:05.526
That's it.

1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:08.330
Don't just say that
'cause I wanna hear it.

1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:09.441
I'm not.

1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:16.087
I let you go once,
I'm not gonna do it again.

1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:25.803
Shit. I'm sorry.
The pasta.

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:27.490
It's gonna... One sec.

1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:40.325
You know, I think I actually
came pretty close

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:42.448
to getting it
right this time.

1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:44.285
I'll get some candles.

1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:26.164
Oh, my God! Ed! Ed! Ed!

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:44.725
I know Tegretol.

1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:47.888
I know it slows you down,
'cause I've seen it in my mom.

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:50.691
She's taken all kinds
of medications her whole life.

1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:53.726
Well, they work
in 70% of cases.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:59.443
Ed, epilepsy is
a serious condition.

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.444
If you have a seizure
driving yourself,

1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:04.648
or with someone else
in the car,

1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.122
or you're in a place
where you could fall,

1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:10.726
this is not something
to be lightly regarded.

1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:13.565
It's essential you commit
yourself to this medication.

1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:17.326
Okay?

1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:20.361
Yeah.

1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:27.125
After you.
Oh, thank you.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:34.324
I've been thinking about
what the doctor said.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:35.925
About less stress.

1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:40.568
A warmer climate
could help.

1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:47.925
If Hawaii is something
that we decide

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:51.209
would be better
for you, I'll go.

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:11.366
Janine, how'd the White
House conversation go?

1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:12.441
I made it quite clear

1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.444
that we were in possession of
an authentic FISA court order.

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:18.000
They wanted to see it.
We refused.

1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:20.447
Now I just pray that
it's actually authentic.

1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:23.689
Are you actually
questioning that?

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:26.610
Glenn, no one has ever seen
a FISA court order.

1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:28.370
There's no precedent here.

1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:31.410
Our source risked his life
for that document. It's real.

1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:35.687
Tell us, did the White House
make any specific claims

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:39.128
about national security that would
prevent you from publishing?

1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:45.011
No. I asked them repeatedly, and
they had no substantive answer.

1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:46.411
Then, there you go!
What more do you want?

1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:48.244
You can go out and
know that you're safe.

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:52.325
Glenn, I'd like to talk to
Alan before we go any further.

1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:53.447
When does he land?

1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:54.726
In six hours.

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.804
No. Absolutely not! We're
sitting ducks here, Janine.

1:18:58.320 --> 1:18:59.651
It's 1:00 p.m.
in New York.

1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:01.404
If you don't get this out
in the next four hours,

1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:03.244
you'll miss the evening news
on the East Coast.

1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:05.800
But we can post
later tonight.

1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:08.287
I'm sorry, Glenn.

1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:10.567
But Alan's our editor-in-chief,
and I really think that...

1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:13.490
Bullshit! The government knows
that we have these documents now.

1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:16.922
The CIA could barge through this door
any minute, and you want more time!

1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:20.850
Act like a fucking journalist
and stop stringing us along!

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.083
I just stood my ground
with the goddamn White House!

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:25.446
I've risked my career!

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:27.443
How dare you question
my commitment to this story!

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:28.885
Okay, let's just
keep our voices down...

1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:30.086
No, you're right.
I am questioning it.

1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:32.521
This is absolutely
inappropriate.

1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:35.368
We are publishing ourselves.
You're out.

1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:47.121
All right, Glenn.

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:49.521
We'll have it ready
by 4:00 p.m.

1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:53.044
I have to go over the
story once more- Why?

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:55.931
Because it still
needs editing, damn you.

1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.924
All this fucking intelligence
jargon is hurting our brains.

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:02.686
This PRISM story is
still incomprehensible.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:04.250
PRISM is the second story,
Janine.

1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:06.169
Verizon is the first story.

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:08.806
Have it ready to post by 4:00
p.m., 5:00 at the latest.

1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:10.120
Ugh...

1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:11.486
No games, or we're gone.

1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:39.325
So, my new job
was counter-spying

1:20:39.400 --> 1:20:44.247
on the Chinese at the NSA Regional
Cryptological Center on Oahu.

1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:48.607
You mind placing your
bag down there, sir?

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:53.444
No personal laptops, no USB
sticks, no cell phones,

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:54.965
no electronic devices
of any kind?

1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:56.121
No, sir.

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:05.927
Thank you.

1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:11.246
Thank you.

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:18.564
Snow White!
Is that you?

1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:21.007
Gabriel?

1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:23.487
Dude, what the hell are you doing here?
Wow!

1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:24.607
That's amazing.

1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:25.727
Oh, man.

1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:27.121
What, do you work here?

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:31.649
Yeah, yeah. Uh, three years,
two months, and five days.

1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:34.883
But who's counting, right? Yeah.

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:38.248
It's like who knew a secret
underground World War II-era base

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:40.402
would become munchie heaven
for a thousand geeks, right?

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.005
So there's good pizza?
Good pizza, yeah.

1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:43.081
That's important.

1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:44.730
Elevator's slow
as shit, though.

1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:45.767
Jesus.

1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:47.080
It's something
else, huh?

1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:52.282
Yeah. So, uh, what deck
are you working on?

1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:55.011
You NTOC or ROC?

1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:00.923
Between you and me? NTOC.

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.525
Cool. You get to
hack the hackers.

1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:03.840
You're coming up
in the world.

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:16.246
Fresh
brains for you, Trevor.

1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:18.527
Trevor James, Interactive
Ops Division Chief.

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:19.601
Ed Snowden.

1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:22.206
I've been briefed.
Next door is NTOC.

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:25.202
Defense. That's where
you'll be working.

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:28.242
Over here we have ROC,
our offense.

1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:32.442
Now I move between the two. We
run a tight ship here, Snowden.

1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:33.885
Yes, sir.

1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:35.200
You'll be working
with Haynes.

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:36.725
Hey. Patrick Haynes.

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:38.131
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Good to have you.

1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:39.440
You watch out for him.

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:41.284
That's the smartest guy
in the building right here.

1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:42.361
Come on.

1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:43.965
Bro, how many languages
you speak, again?

1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:47.044
I mean, seven in code,
six spoken, two signs.

1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:48.121
That's cool.

1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:56.244
Great. Another language
I can't understand.

1:22:56.320 --> 1:22:57.685
Uh, I'll check you
later, Ed.

1:22:57.760 --> 1:22:58.841
Okay. See you.

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:04.605
Wait for it.

1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:08.242
Any moment.

1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:12.047
We got 'em.

1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:13.406
Lights over
Waziristan, gentlemen.

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:15.121
Way to go.

1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:17.931
So what exactly do we
contribute to this?

1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:19.647
The underside of
that Reaper drone

1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:21.484
is fixed with
a big-ass antenna,

1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:24.331
snarfing the hardware ID
of anything that broadcasts.

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:26.687
We do the geolocator.

1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:27.886
My friend Tasha
here at the Air Force

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:29.610
rains hellfire.
There she is now.

1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:31.843
Hey, Trev.
You likin' the show?

1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:34.482
You know it. We track 'em,
you whack 'em.

1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:36.404
And who
did we just track?

1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:38.764
Not who, what.

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:42.003
We're targeting bad guys' cell phones.
Sometimes the SIM card.

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:44.521
Okay, and how do we
know the bad guy

1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:46.204
is in possession of
the bad cell phone

1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:47.441
when we strike?

1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:48.567
Well, we don't...

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:51.650
Course we do. JSOC and CIA have
their people in the field.

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.490
What's the program name?

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:56.850
Epic Shelter.

1:23:56.920 --> 1:24:00.083
It was originally some
backup program for, um...

1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:02.561
Catastrophic site failure.

1:24:02.680 --> 1:24:04.648
Yeah. How did
you know that?

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:07.047
I built it.

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:08.486
You?
Yeah.

1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:11.289
You know I've actually...
I've been thinking about, uh,

1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:13.562
another use
for Epic Shelter.

1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:14.687
What'd you have
in mind?

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:17.608
Well, I was chatting
with Jim Lowell

1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:18.681
about how there's
so many programs...

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:19.807
Deputy Director Lowell?

1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:22.042
Yeah. Yeah.

1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:24.367
And we were saying there's
so many programs nowadays,

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:26.488
it's kind of impossible to keep
track of them anymore, right?

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:29.245
So why not create
a centralized database.

1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:31.085
Ah. Like an index.

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.481
Yeah, exactly. Something
that updates in real time,

1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:37.281
you know, we've already got Epic
Shelter collecting our finished Intel.

1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:40.842
We just need a web portal to
catalogue it, make it searchable.

1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:43.371
Let me think about it.

1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:45.442
In any case, I'd have to
run it past Fort Meade.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:46.567
Of course.

1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:47.801
Did you have a name?

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:51.007
Yeah, if it's not taken,
I'd call it Heartbeat.

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:56.211
Heartbeat. FEMALE DRONE
PILOT: Six, five, four,

1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:59.688
three, two, one...

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:01.091
Engage target.

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:17.605
You okay down there?

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:19.847
Yep-

1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:23.365
See, this is why I keep saying
we need to hike more.

1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:25.486
You're right.

1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:27.041
Hey, can you
look at me?

1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:28.121
Oh!

1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:31.360
Come on. It's been years.

1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:34.370
By social media standards,
you don't even exist anymore.

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:36.041
Just one.

1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:40.047
Okay, smile. Show me your teeth!

1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:44.491
My elusive E,
finally captured.

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:46.449
So now I'm
a viable boyfriend?

1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:47.726
Yes.

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.051
Such a shame, you used to be
such a cute little model.

1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:54.167
Little?
Yeah.

1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:56.368
Was I little?
Wait!

1:25:58.560 --> 1:25:59.925
Stop!

1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:03.808
Oh, my God.
What?

1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:05.843
Think you got some sun!

1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.002
I'm serious,
it looks good!

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:09.445
Well, that's impossible.

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.207
Hey, um, I've been meaning
to ask you, by the way.

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:15.611
Did you switch
pharmacies?

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:20.048
'Cause I tried to pick up
your prescription,

1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:23.443
and I couldn't.

1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:24.760
Why did you do that?

1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:30.722
Uh, because I was there and
thought it would be helpful.

1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:45.003
I stopped taking
the Tegretol.

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:49.451
What? When?

1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:51.204
A couple months ago.

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:52.361
And you're just
now telling me?

1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:54.204
I wanted to tell you.

1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:57.568
I did, I just... I can't take
that stuff, it makes me groggy,

1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:00.120
and I need to be
sharp for work.

1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:01.850
I need to be on the
ball all the time.

1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:03.046
What is it about
this fucking job

1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:05.600
that makes it more
important than your life?

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:08.326
I don't understand.

1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:09.731
Our government...

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:13.811
Our government, what?

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:18.122
Our government is hemorrhaging
billions of dollars

1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:20.726
every year
to Chinese hackers.

1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:23.326
And I've been hired
to shut them down.

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:28.800
A lot of people
are depending on me.

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.843
More so than
anyone else?

1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:34.481
Yes.

1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:41.166
No, this is bullshit.

1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:48.730
We didn't come to Hawaii
for you to heal, did we?

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:52.207
There was never gonna be
a less stressful job out here.

1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:55.124
Look, I feel like
I'm made to do this.

1:27:55.200 --> 1:28:00.161
And if I don't do it, then I don't
know anybody else that can.

1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.527
It's like I'm on a trajectory
that I can't turn back from.

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.170
You can
always turn back.

1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:17.886
What I wanted to see

1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:21.407
is if you could give me a yes
or no answer to the question,

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:25.883
"Does the NSA collect
any type of data at all

1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:29.407
"on millions or hundreds
of millions of Americans?"

1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:31.561
No, sir.

1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:33.645
It does not?

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:36.810
Not wittingly.

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:39.486
There are cases where
they could inadvertently,

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:41.449
perhaps, uh, collect,

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:43.124
but not wittingly.

1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:44.406
Oh, really?

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:46.448
Thank you, and
I'll have additional questions

1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:48.409
to give you in writing
on that point.

1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:51.085
Okay, so, uh,

1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:53.401
what I wanted to
show you guys is, um,

1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:57.007
the slide I ran across while
building this indexing program.

1:28:57.400 --> 1:28:58.447
And what is this?

1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:00.330
Okay. So, this is
data collection

1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:02.323
for the month of March

1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:04.681
worldwide,
emails and Skype calls.

1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:11.086
So France, 70 million. Germany,
500 million. Brazil, two billion.

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:13.848
Inside the U.S.,

1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:17.163
3.1 billion emails and calls.

1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:19.607
That's not including any of
the telecom company data.

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:21.523
Okay, so what's
the collection in Russia?

1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:25.647
Russia
is 1.5 billion.

1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:27.370
Wait, so we're collecting
twice as much

1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:29.044
in the U.S.
as we are in Russia?

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:30.201
Yeah, I figured it
was a lot, but...

1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.521
This shit
is out of hand, man.

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:34.682
Wait. Have you shown
this to anyone else?

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.529
No, you guys
are the first.

1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:38.847
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I'd be careful about that.

1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:40.888
You know, it could seem
like you're rocking the boat.

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:41.961
Yeah, you're right.

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:44.247
No, I just, uh,
I needed to know

1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:46.641
if I was the only one that
thought this was crazy.

1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:48.725
What the fuck's
going on?

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:49.847
Hey, Trev.

1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:50.967
What are you doing
in here?

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:52.280
It's nothing.
I was just showing them

1:29:52.360 --> 1:29:54.806
this one slide,
I needed some input.

1:29:54.880 --> 1:29:56.006
Why the heat map?

1:29:56.080 --> 1:29:57.730
It's my bad, Trev.

1:29:57.800 --> 1:29:59.802
I made a bet with Ed
about which country

1:29:59.880 --> 1:30:02.486
we were collecting
the most signals from.

1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:04.483
He said Iran,
I said Pakistan.

1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:07.005
Who won?

1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:08.766
Ed.

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:13.641
Yeah, I need to
head out. I'll see you guys.

1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:14.921
You're going
down next time, man.

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.126
Yeah, okay.

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:18.930
No more bets.

1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.002
And I don't want anyone
unauthorized in here again.

1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:22.525
Especially not
with Heartbeat.

1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:24.329
You're right.
Won't happen again.

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:40.365
Happy birthday!

1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:48.569
...in Vegas,
looking at Afghanistan.

1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:50.768
So we're running late hours.

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.645
So this blurry object comes
wandering into the strike zone.

1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:56.249
We all knew
that it was a kid.

1:30:56.520 --> 1:30:57.521
Poof

1:30:57.920 --> 1:30:58.921
He's gone.

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.287
We called in for clarification,
and the report came back

1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.089
that it was a dog.

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:06.245
Okay. Fine.

1:31:06.880 --> 1:31:11.010
Shift's long, day and night.
I don't remember.

1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:14.004
But same village,
two, three days later.

1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:15.366
We see the funeral party.

1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:17.647
We knew it was a kid
that they were burying.

1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:19.927
Moms and dads wailing.

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.731
And then the order comes down.
Pretty clear. Hit 'em.

1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:24.401
Poof

1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:29.490
And they are gone
in a cloud of dust.

1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:36.171
I mean, all of them.
The whole fuckin' family.

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:38.803
But the crazy thing is,

1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:40.723
you come home after work,

1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:44.930
kiss your wife, your kids,
back to work the next day.

1:31:45.040 --> 1:31:50.171
Pretty soon, you know,
it just all becomes routine.

1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:54.525
Fuck that.

1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:58.400
You make it sound criminal, man.
It's war. It's a job.

1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:02.121
Oh, I don't know, man. You
saying jobs can't be criminal?

1:32:02.720 --> 1:32:04.290
Not if you're working
for the government.

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.765
You ever hear about
the Nuremberg trials, Trev?

1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:10.370
They weren't that long ago.

1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:13.523
Yeah. And we hung
the Nazi big shots, right?

1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:16.527
Yeah, well, the big shots
were the first trial,

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:20.525
but then the next trial
were just the judges,

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:23.604
and lawyers,
and policemen, and guards,

1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:28.288
and ordinary people just doing
their jobs, following orders.

1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:31.608
That's where we got
the Nuremberg principles,

1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:35.810
which then the UN made
into international law,

1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:40.363
just in case ordinary jobs
become criminal again.

1:32:43.640 --> 1:32:44.926
Just sayin'.

1:32:56.800 --> 1:32:58.086
That's gotta
wake you up. You okay?

1:32:58.160 --> 1:32:59.605
See, I told you
not to grab my hand.

1:33:12.440 --> 1:33:13.885
...fucking touch me
anymore.

1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:32.682
Dude! Dude, are you okay?
on, my God.

1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:34.205
Ed, are you okay?

1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:36.089
Are you okay, man?
I think he's having a...

1:33:36.200 --> 1:33:37.884
Get away,
don't touch him.

1:33:37.960 --> 1:33:39.610
- Don't touch him, don't touch him.
- Don't...

1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:12.565
Hey, Ed. How are you?
How's your health?

1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:15.128
Hey, Corbin. Uh...

1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:19.966
It's fine.
Thanks for asking.

1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:22.931
Must be nerve-wrecking
living with that condition.

1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:27.243
You wouldn't know it
to look at your numbers.

1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:30.403
Two hundred Chinese IPs down
in your first four months.

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:35.564
Those are, uh,
internal numbers.

1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:39.247
Your colleague, Trevor,
comes out of the CIA like you.

1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:43.126
He's been, uh, keeping me
informed on your progress.

1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:48.763
It's outstanding
work. Heartbeat as well.

1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:52.564
Thank you. Thanks.
That means a lot.

1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:55.769
Lowell is very pleased.
He, uh, sends his regards.

1:34:56.400 --> 1:34:57.640
That's great to hear.

1:34:58.680 --> 1:34:59.966
He, um...

1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:06.730
He doesn't know about
your heat map conversations,

1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:09.963
or some of the ideas you've
expressed to your colleagues.

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:12.131
And he's not going to.

1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:14.645
Yeah. Uh...

1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:19.485
You know, Heartbeat
is proving a tricky project.

1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:21.528
Collating from
multiple agencies,

1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:24.080
and knowing
where to pull from.

1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:27.369
It has helped to talk
it over with colleagues.

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.245
I believe in you, Ed.

1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:35.168
Which is why nothing happened to
you after the derog in Geneva.

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.811
And I'm very grateful
you've looked out for me.

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:40.001
Or after you, uh,

1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:45.090
omitted the truth
in your last polygraph.

1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:50.051
What was it you were
withholding exactly?

1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:51.927
Hmm?

1:35:57.040 --> 1:35:58.451
You remember
that day in class,

1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:01.285
you were talking to us
about the FISA Court?

1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:06.366
You said that they approved
Bush's wiretapping programs.

1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.203
Sometimes we're restricted
from telling the whole truth.

1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:15.281
Doesn't give us
permission to lie.

1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:17.443
Come on, Corbin,

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.569
the Director of National
Intelligence just lied to Congress!

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:25.207
Sorry.

1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:31.725
Look at me.

1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:41.285
Did you access
an unauthorized program

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:43.886
that I did not know about?

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.211
Yes.

1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:54.011
It was, uh...

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.809
It was at Geneva.
It was Lindsay.

1:36:56.880 --> 1:36:58.166
I was jealous.

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:02.251
And I'm sorry.
I never did it again.

1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:17.241
Listen, Ed.

1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:24.687
I know it's been up and down with
you and Lindsay since Geneva.

1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:29.684
It's tough to keep any relationship going.
Few of us do.

1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:35.163
So, if it'll give you any peace
of mind, I can assure you,

1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:39.882
she's not sleeping with that
photographer friend of hers.

1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:42.089
If that's what
you're thinking.

1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:47.689
I have to go to
a Five Eyes conference

1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:49.489
in Sydney in
a couple of weeks.

1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:51.801
I'll stop off in Hawaii
on the way back.

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:54.766
Okay?

1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.205
Okay. Thank you.

1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:02.971
I'll see you soon.

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:20.406
Hey,Dad.

1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.084
Good. Did you get the e-mail
that I sent you with the photos?

1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:27.761
Uh-huh.

1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:31.323
Well, I was hoping that
you could send me some...

1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:42.007
What are you doing?

1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:05.241
Sit down.

1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:14.364
Your e-mail is
being monitored.

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:17.207
So?

1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:18.967
No, it's different now.

1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:21.520
It's not passive collection,
it's full-take surveillance.

1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:25.486
It's all of your e-mails, calls,
texts, social media, everything.

1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:30.009
It's also possible
that the house is bugged.

1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:31.440
I'm not sure.

1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:33.246
By who?

1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:37.410
By a senior officer
at the CIA.

1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:41.006
You in trouble?
Is it the Chinese thing?

1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:46.441
Look, there's things
that I wish I could tell you,

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:50.411
but I can't because
you could get very hurt.

1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.810
What's keeping you safe is
that you don't know anything.

1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:03.962
I'm sorry, I really am. I didn't
want any of this for you.

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.448
But I know you would think
I was doing the right thing.

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:18.323
So just listen to me
for a sec, okay?

1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:21.483
When we go back in the house,
everything has to appear normal.

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:23.688
We're gonna act like
nothing has changed,

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.206
but if you do notice
something that's weird,

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.123
you need to
tell me right away.

1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:31.608
And you're gonna use an encrypted
e-mail that I'm setting up for you.

1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:34.047
Oh, my God,
I don't think I can do this.

1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:35.690
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:39.170
Do I even have a choice?

1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.884
I'm asking you
to trust me.

1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:51.686
And, Linds,
I think it'd be best

1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:54.366
if you went back
to Maryland for a while.

1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:58.761
Tell your parents that I'm
away on a business trip

1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.286
and that you're homesick.

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.084
Are you going away?

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.720
Yes. But just
for a little while.

1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:14.241
No.

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:16.481
No, I can't go.

1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:18.005
Please.
Just until I get back.

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.206
I can't go.

1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:25.963
You just said that we have to
appear like nothing's changed.

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:29.642
If both of us left at the same time,
wouldn't that seem suspicious?

1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:41.650
I will do this for you.

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:48.643
But it is the last time.

1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:26.166
Yo! Yo, you hear
about Trevor, bro?

1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:27.321
No, what?

1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:29.801
You remember that op
to own the Internet in Syria?

1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:31.086
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:33.640
Trevor and his TAO team
crashed the core router.

1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:36.810
Bro, the whole
country's gone dark.

1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:38.649
Jesus Christ.

1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:39.767
Figure it out!

1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:40.927
Poor bastards.

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:45.089
Okay, I'm gonna, uh...
I gotta get to work.

1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:46.207
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:48.924
So, Ed, how's, uh...

1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:51.170
How's Heartbeat coming?

1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:53.041
It's close.

1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:55.921
It's very close.

1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:57.771
Pull it up
on this monitor.

1:42:57.840 --> 1:42:58.966
I'm still
trying to access...

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:00.451
Don't tell me you're
involved in this, too?

1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.320
Well, Trevor fucking roped me into going
through their zero-day exploit codes.

1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:06.641
This thing is
a fucking mess, man.

1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:11.448
Why did I agree to this?
Good luck.

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:13.881
This is Patrick...

1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:16.364
What you're gonna
do is you're gonna...

1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:24.564
I told him, I...
Help them.

1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:52.451
Okay.
Get back to work, guys.

1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:53.521
No, Patrick, show me.

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:39.925
Talk about
getting hung out to dry.

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:41.729
Yeah. Are we set?

1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:44.771
Trouble with the Navy?

1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:47.527
One of those idiots ripped
some bullshit piece of Israeli code

1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:49.728
and jammed it down our payload.
Can you fucking believe that?

1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.081
Script kiddies.

1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:52.571
I know, I know. I
should have listened to you.

1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:54.005
God damn it.
Is this it?

1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:55.366
Here.
Yeah, this is it.

1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:58.011
I'm gonna make the goddamn
Israelis take the fall for this.

1:45:58.800 --> 1:45:59.961
Come on.

1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:04.929
Got it? I'm not taking
the fall for this.

1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:15.681
Patrick.

1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:20.804
Still working on it,
Trev. Hold on.

1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:22.121
Nothing. Still nothing.

1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:34.721
Yeah, but...

1:47:18.760 --> 1:47:20.728
You, uh... You headed
home already?

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:24.088
Yeah. I'm not
feeling so well.

1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:26.162
Might not be in
tomorrow either.

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.450
You know,
Trevor's kind of busy,

1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:29.965
maybe you could
let him know for me?

1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:32.122
Yeah. Yeah, man.
It'd be my pleasure.

1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:35.251
You know,
if you're, uh...

1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:37.766
If you're really not feeling well,
dude, maybe you should, uh,

1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:40.089
go back to the States
and see your doctor.

1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.323
I think that, you know,
folks would understand that.

1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:47.844
That sounds like
a smart thing.

1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.411
Take care of yourself.

1:47:57.040 --> 1:47:58.326
Yeah, you too, bro.

1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:20.487
Hey.
Hey.

1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:23.444
You ever play
with one of these?

1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:26.166
Yeah, when I was a kid.

1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:28.607
Yeah. You should try it.
It's hard.

1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:51.451
I can't figure this out.

1:48:57.840 --> 1:48:59.490
I don't know
about this.

1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:01.563
Yeah, you gotta start with
the white cross, actually,

1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:03.210
and then you do
the corners.

1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:04.761
Oh, man.

1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:07.889
Look, I love these things.

1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:09.291
Hey, have
a good weekend, man.

1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:10.850
You too, buddy.
All right.

1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:07.806
It's live.

1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:14.968
There's a link to
the FISA court order.

1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:24.841
Well done, Janine.

1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:26.445
I told you
she wasn't a pushover.

1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.727
Well, it feels so
goddamn good to be wrong.

1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:39.641
Breaking news tonight. Reports
that through a secret court order,

1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:42.291
the Obama administration is
collecting the phone records

1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.044
of millions of
Verizon customers.

1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:46.327
That's been reported by the
Guardian newspaper in the U.K.

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:47.686
The specific court order shows

1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:50.889
that all the information is going
to the National Security Agency.

1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.048
How's that for
mainstream media, Glenn?

1:50:55.120 --> 1:50:57.805
They can't shut this down now. And
we've got four more days of it.

1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:00.002
They have no idea what
they're in store for.

1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:01.161
That's fantastic!

1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:04.050
...former Speaker of the House
is on the grill tonight and joins me now.

1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.487
Another explosive
article has just appeared,

1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.005
this time in
The Washington Post.

1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:10.162
It's breaking news
that it reveals

1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:13.642
another broad and secret U.S.
government surveillance program.

1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:17.327
The Washington Post and the
Guardian in London reporting

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:18.930
that the NSA and the FBI

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:22.129
are tapping directly
into the central servers

1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:24.521
of nine leading
Internet companies,

1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:27.206
including Microsoft,
Yahoo, Google, Facebook,

1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:30.204
AOL, Skype, YouTube,
and Apple.

1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:32.521
The Post says
they're extracting audio,

1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:35.444
video, photographs,
e-mails, documents,

1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:36.726
and connection logs

1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:39.121
that enable analysts to
track a person's movements

1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:41.441
and contacts over time.

1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:48.327
In the abstract, you can
complain about Big Brother

1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:52.530
and how this is a potential
program run amok.

1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:54.802
But when you actually
look at the details,

1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:56.962
then I think we've struck
the right balance.

1:51:57.040 --> 1:52:00.203
U.S. President
Barack Obama staunchly defends

1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:02.487
U.S. government programs,

1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:05.928
insisting that they were
conducted with broad safeguards

1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.287
and to protect against abuse.

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:12.401
He reached the conclusion
that what was happening

1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:14.881
inside this really
secretive agency

1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:17.247
uh, was very
threatening and menacing

1:52:17.320 --> 1:52:19.721
to privacy rights,
to Internet freedom,

1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:22.610
to basic political liberty,
not only in the United States,

1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:24.728
but all around the world.

1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:28.526
And he felt it was his duty as
a human being to disclose it.

1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:42.563
Uh, my name's Ed Snowden.
I'm 29 years old.

1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:44.085
I work for
Booz Allen Hamilton

1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:47.687
as an infrastructure analyst
for NSA in Hawaii.

1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:00.481
The identity of the man
who sent the Obama...

1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:04.770
You can't come forward against the
most powerful intelligence agencies

1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:07.451
in the world without expecting
to have some risk.

1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:09.602
They're just such
powerful adversaries.

1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:12.610
So no one can
meaningfully oppose them.

1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:13.801
He did it.

1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:16.724
You know, if they want to get
you, they will get you, in time.

1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:17.801
The kid did it!

1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:19.769
And it's just gonna get
worse for the next generation,

1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:21.205
as they extend
the capabilities

1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:24.807
of this sort of
architecture of oppression.

1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:29.204
And you realize that you might
be willing to accept any risk,

1:53:29.320 --> 1:53:33.041
as long as the public is able
to make their own decision

1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:34.764
about how
this is applied.

1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.731
Because even if you haven't
done anything wrong,

1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:39.768
you're being
watched and recorded.

1:53:41.080 --> 1:53:44.243
Look, I had access to the
entire intelligence community.

1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:47.563
So, if I had wanted
to harm the U.S.,

1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:51.884
you could shut down the entire
surveillance system in an afternoon.

1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:55.248
But that was never
my intention.

1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:58.403
And I think anybody
that's making that argument,

1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:02.849
they have to think,
if they were in my position,

1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:06.686
living in Hawaii, in paradise,
and making a ton of money,

1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:11.641
what would it take to make
you leave everything behind?

1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:17.368
The fear that I think I have
most in regards to the outcome

1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:20.205
for America of
these disclosures

1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:22.487
is that nothing
will change.

1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:26.360
In the coming months and the coming
years, it'll just get worse.

1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:29.011
And then eventually,
at some point,

1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:33.165
some new leader
will be elected

1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:37.131
who flips the switch,

1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:44.049
and the people won't be able to do
anything, by that point, to oppose it.

1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:47.082
And it'll be
turnkey tyranny.

1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:50.201
How you holding up?

1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:53.282
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:55.645
It's you guys that have
to start watching out

1:54:55.720 --> 1:54:57.210
for yourselves now.

1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:00.886
You know, if you have
any reason to believe

1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:05.568
that you're about to be raided or
intercepted or breached in any way,

1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:10.202
you format and destroy
all the data immediately.

1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:13.250
You have
the encrypted backups.

1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:15.451
And now, I...

1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:21.364
I no longer have any access
to these files myself.

1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:23.090
You guys have them all.

1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:26.201
Uh...

1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:29.490
Keep the focus on the stories,
that's all that matters.

1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:33.170
If you'll excuse me, it's...

1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:38.082
I think we should all get some rest.
We can use it.

1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:41.443
Yeah. I should probably
lay down on a soft bed

1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:43.568
while I still have
one available, right?

1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:47.089
You rest well.
Thank you.

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:50.725
See you tomorrow.
Good night.

1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:23.367
Can you at least tell me
where you're going?

1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:49.810
Listen,
I know that I'm...

1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:09.764
Ewen, I'm on
the second floor.

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:12.611
I don't see Tibbo.

1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:17.247
No. No, no, wait.
Okay. I think I see him.

1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:19.246
Shit!

1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:22.281
There's press swarming
all over the hotel.

1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:24.044
Yeah, I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:26.168
I'll stop them with a press
conference or something.

1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:30.205
Hey, I'm Glenn. Look, we
really appreciate this.

1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:32.328
We understand you're one of the
best lawyers in Hong Kong.

1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:33.487
We'll do our best.

1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:36.530
We're gonna take him to the UN
first, then I prefer not to reveal.

1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.567
I understand.

1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:39.927
Shit. They spotted me.
You guys get going.

1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:45.244
Okay, I will take your questions
in an orderly fashion.

1:57:45.320 --> 1:57:46.401
Where is Snowden?
Do you know where he is?

1:57:46.480 --> 1:57:47.481
Come on,
please let us know!

1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:49.241
Did you get them?

1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:50.924
Yeah, this is the best
I could do.

1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:53.611
You're meeting Tibbo
in five minutes,

1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:56.206
on the skybridge
opposite the large mall.

1:57:59.960 --> 1:58:04.204
I've met a lot of astonishing
people in my life, but you...

1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:08.687
Okay, laddie.
Off you go.

1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:11.130
I won't let you down.

1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:15.806
You'd make a shitty journalist
without a camera.

1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:18.444
Are you sure?
Yeah.

1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:21.804
Okay. That's a great idea.

1:58:23.680 --> 1:58:24.681
Thanks.

1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:29.168
Oh! You don't want to
leave your luck behind.

1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:30.721
Oh.

1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:32.849
I think I'd like you
to have that.

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:37.281
Thanks for everything.

1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:39.041
Thank you.

1:59:02.720 --> 1:59:04.051
I have
a van on the street.

1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:12.403
NSA leaker Edward
Snowden has now been charged formally

1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:17.247
with espionage, theft, and
conversion of government property.

1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:19.124
U.S.
officials have asked Hong Kong

1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:20.725
to detain
the former contractor

1:59:20.840 --> 1:59:22.649
on a provisional
arrest warrant.

1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:24.848
Snowden has been
in Hong Kong since May...

1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:28.129
...remember, that
was back reportedly on May 20th.

1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:31.331
...Snowden has checked
out of the luxury hotel in Hong Kong,

1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:32.640
where he had been holed up.

1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:36.847
You might
turn your eyes away.

1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:38.331
...not likely
take action against him

1:59:38.440 --> 1:59:39.441
without an arrest
warrant from the U. S.

1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:42.171
The Justice Department
had to go to Interpol so that Snowden,

1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:44.447
if he tried to cross a border, he
could be intercepted and detained.

1:59:44.520 --> 1:59:45.931
Snowden is still in hiding.

1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:47.001
So again...

1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:48.764
But the
Americans are now closing in.

1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:51.002
They almost certainly know
where he is,

1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:53.726
they just need Hong Kong's
approval to get him.

1:59:53.800 --> 1:59:55.529
The Hong
Kong government does have

1:59:55.600 --> 1:59:57.648
an extradition agreement
with Washington.

1:59:57.720 --> 1:59:58.846
But the ultimate decision...

1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:02.362
So the big
question here is, where is he now?

2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:08.169
Thank you.
This is Ed. Ed, Mayana.

2:00:08.240 --> 2:00:09.924
Hi, Ed. Welcome.
Thank you.

2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:11.890
Thank you.

2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:14.723
These are good people.
They won't talk.

2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:18.170
I've been handling their cases for years.
They're like you.

2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:19.446
That's so nice.

2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:21.649
They're stateless.
Yeah.

2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:25.567
So we're waiting on the UN
application for refugee status.

2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:26.766
Yeah.

2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:29.684
Just in case you're arrested,
this is where you can call me.

2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:30.807
Yeah.

2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:34.121
Good.

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:36.131
Thank you so much.

2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:45.008
You may not feel it,
Ed, but you're not alone.

2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:46.961
Thank you.

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:51.648
...his longtime
girlfriend, Lindsay Mills,

2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:52.926
an amateur photographer,

2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.411
has not been heard from.

2:00:54.480 --> 2:00:56.403
It's believed
she's in seclusion

2:00:56.480 --> 2:00:58.005
in her parents' home
in Maryland,

2:00:58.080 --> 2:00:59.923
and has been questioned
by the FBI

2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.923
and remains
under investigation.

2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:07.606
Ten days have now gone by,
as the world looks for Edward Snowden.

2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:11.082
Rumors have surfaced that a rich
supporter is hiding Snowden

2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:14.522
somewhere in the Hong Kong
hills in a private mansion.

2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:48.927
It is now
confirmed that Edward Snowden

2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.321
has boarded a flight
from Hong Kong to Moscow.

2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:53.289
The State Department
is very disappointed

2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:54.964
in the authorities
in Hong Kong

2:01:55.040 --> 2:01:56.690
for letting Snowden go.

2:01:56.760 --> 2:01:59.331
He was accompanied
by a representative from WikiLeaks.

2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:02.563
Snowden is trying
to make his way from Russia to Cuba,

2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:04.847
and then to Ecuador
for political asylum.

2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:07.167
Moscow airport
officials say he won't be permitted

2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:08.651
to make his connective flight

2:02:08.720 --> 2:02:11.166
because the U.S. government
has revoked his passport.

2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:13.971
The United States
Secretary of State, John Kerry,

2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:17.931
outraged that Russia is refusing
to arrest the American fugitive.

2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:22.164
Now a man without a country
stranded inside the Moscow airport.

2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:24.925
No, I'm not gonna
be scrambling jets, uh,

2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.608
to get a 29-year-old hacker.

2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:32.650
The President of Bolivia's plane

2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:35.007
was forced down in
Austria airspace today

2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:39.369
following U.S. suspicions that
Snowden may have been on board.

2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:41.807
After 39 days in the airport hotel,

2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:44.326
he's left with his Russian
lawyer and a legal advisor

2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:46.528
from WikiLeaks, Sarah Harrison.

2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:50.210
He can now enjoy
all of the sweet, sweet liberty

2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:53.443
allowed under the regime
of President Vladimir Putin.

2:02:53.520 --> 2:02:56.729
There is still
a thing called execution.

2:02:56.800 --> 2:02:58.131
Mr. Snowden
actually deserves asylum

2:02:58.200 --> 2:02:59.486
and protection
around the globe.

2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:02.729
But he does have asylum
in Russia at least.

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:04.802
He can engage in
the debate he started.

2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:06.726
And the world
now has an example

2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:08.040
that you can do
the right thing,

2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:11.886
and you don't have to end up
in a cage, one room, a prison.

2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:17.169
After more than a year
in the country under temporary asylum,

2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:21.643
Edward Snowden has received a
three-year residency permit in Russia.

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:33.049
And now,
here live from Moscow,

2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:34.924
Edward Snowden.

2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:38.169
Hi, Ed. How you doing?

2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:45.005
Thank you.

2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:48.007
Uh, forgive me if I get my
bearings a little bit here.

2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:50.560
People always said
I was kind of a robot.

2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.566
How is it that
you came to be in Russia?

2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.924
Well, I never intended
to come here.

2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.925
You know, my passport was revoked
en route to Latin America.

2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.651
So when people say,
"Why are you in Russia?"

2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:06.610
I say,
"Ask the State Department."

2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:11.047
Does that mean you're willing
to go back and face trial?

2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:15.645
Absolutely, if it was
a fair and public trial.

2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:19.045
Unfortunately, that's not
what would happen right now,

2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:23.205
as long as the Espionage Act is
being used against whistleblowers.

2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:26.528
Do you still
think it was worth it?

2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:27.647
Yes, I do.

2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:31.645
Without the information
to start a public debate,

2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:33.131
we're lost.
You know...

2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:37.281
The people being able
to question our government

2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:39.966
and hold it accountable,

2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:44.967
that's the principle that the United
States of America was founded on.

2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:48.801
So if we want to protect
our national security,

2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:51.326
we should be protecting
that principle.

2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:55.247
What if your
argument falls on deaf ears?

2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:57.641
What if our leaders
don't act?

2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:01.683
I believe that,
if nothing changes,

2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:07.242
more and more people all over
the world will come forward.

2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:12.926
Whistleblowers and journalists,
but also regular citizens.

2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:19.608
And when those in power try to
hide by classifying everything,

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:23.204
we will call them out on it.

2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:29.489
And when they try to scare us into
sacrificing our basic human rights,

2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:31.847
we won't be intimidated,

2:05:31.960 --> 2:05:36.602
and we won't give up,
and we will not be silenced.

2:05:38.240 --> 2:05:40.083
You're alone in
a foreign country,

2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:43.403
you'll be extradited
if you try to leave.

2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:45.164
That must be hard.

2:05:57.680 --> 2:06:01.241
When I left Hawaii,
I lost everything.

2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:06.848
And I had a stable life.

2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:12.008
A stable love.

2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:14.003
Family. Future.

2:06:15.800 --> 2:06:17.643
And I lost that life,

2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:22.648
but I've gained
a new one,

2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:26.963
and I'm incredibly
fortunate.

2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:30.731
And I think

2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:34.165
the greatest freedom
that I've gained

2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:37.847
is the fact that I no longer have to
worry about what happens tomorrow,

2:06:37.920 --> 2:06:40.321
because I'm happy with
what I've done today.

2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:48.764
Live from the Internet,
Edward Snowden!

2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:08.410
Has your
mindset changed about him?

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:12.565
Is he now more whistleblower
than he is a, uh, hacker?

2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:51.928
What is going
to happen to Edward Snowden?

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.731
He's going to die in Moscow.
He's not coming home.

2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:35.007
Edward Snowden,
is he a traitor or a hero?

2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:38.363
He stole
very important information.

2:09:56.960 --> 2:09:58.291
We have
breaking news tonight...

2:09:58.360 --> 2:09:59.361
Among the reforms,

2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:02.125
work with Congress to change how
the NSA collects phone records.

2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:05.766
Mandate more transparency
by the secret court

2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:07.922
that regularly approves
the surveillance.

2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:11.808
Well, is it
a victory for Edward Snowden?

2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:13.723
That's gonna depend
on the eye of the beholder.

2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:17.887
The American
government was acting illegally.

2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:20.884
I don't think he should
be brought home without facing the music.

2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:24.769
Snowden played
a very important role

2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:27.002
in educating
the American people

2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:31.483
to the degree in which our civil
liberties and our constitutional rights

2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:32.721
are being undermined.
