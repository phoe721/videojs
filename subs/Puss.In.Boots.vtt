00:35.800 --> 00:45.150
<i>Through the years I have been known by many names.
Diablo Gato, The Furry Lover...</i>

00:45.750 --> 00:49.950
<i>... Chupa Cabra, Frisky Two Times ...</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:52.950
<i>... and then The Gingerhead man.</i>

00:53.850 --> 00:58.550
<i>But to most I am Puss in Boots,</i>

00:59.450 --> 01:01.250
<i>Outlaw!</i>

01:34.650 --> 01:37.750
I'll never forget you, Margarita ...

01:39.250 --> 01:44.150
I mean ... Rosa.
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

02:23.650 --> 02:27.950
You cannot run forever, Puss in Boots!

02:34.950 --> 02:38.550
<i>What can I say? I was a bad kitty.</i>

02:43.150 --> 02:47.850
<i>... just a fugitive from the law,
forever running</i>

02:47.950 --> 02:51.050
<i>Searching for a way to clear my name.</i>

02:54.550 --> 03:00.250
<i>And I would get that chance
on this one fateful night.</i>

03:48.650 --> 03:50.550
Kitty-kitty!

03:55.250 --> 04:00.050
Raoul, look what the cat dragged in.
Oh, wait! That is the cat!

04:04.550 --> 04:06.750
Bottle of leche, please.

04:09.450 --> 04:14.350
<i>What are you doing here,  Senor ?
Did you lose your ball of thread</i>

04:19.150 --> 04:21.050
So funny!

04:21.150 --> 04:23.250
One leche coming up!

04:37.350 --> 04:39.350
<i>I am not looking for trouble.</i>

04:44.950 --> 04:48.550
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

04:48.650 --> 04:51.950
Perhaps you gentlemen
can let me find a simple score.

04:52.450 --> 04:57.250
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble, Puss in Boots.

05:07.950 --> 05:10.350
Well perhaps if one of us
were to tell the law

05:10.450 --> 05:14.250
that you're in town,
we could split the reward.

05:24.350 --> 05:28.950
You made the cat angry...
You do not want to make the cat angry!

05:31.550 --> 05:34.750
The church if St. Michael has just put up
a golden statue of,

05:34.750 --> 05:36.250
The Virgin of Guadalupe.

05:36.350 --> 05:38.350
I do not steal from churches!

05:38.650 --> 05:41.350
Well, the boys orphanage has been donated
silver candlesticks,

05:41.450 --> 05:43.050
they would look very lovely in your home!

05:43.050 --> 05:45.250
I do not steal from orphans!

05:46.150 --> 05:49.250
- Uh...what about Jack and Jill?
- Shh! Are you crazy?

05:49.350 --> 05:50.950
The what?

05:55.250 --> 06:00.450
The murderous outlaws, Jack and Jill,
have gotten their hands on magic beans.

06:00.550 --> 06:02.950
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

06:03.050 --> 06:07.450
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.850
No, cat...
We have seen them!

06:11.150 --> 06:15.150
These are the beans of legends...

06:17.550 --> 06:23.950
Grows the vine to the land of giants.
And the golden goose...

06:24.050 --> 06:26.050
golden goose...

06:26.150 --> 06:29.050
Yeah, it's like this could set you up for life.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.550
All nine of them. Show him the golden eggs!

06:33.050 --> 06:34.950
No!

06:35.050 --> 06:37.750
Please uh...you have uh...shown enough.

06:37.850 --> 06:43.250
Only a cat with a death wish
would steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

06:44.450 --> 06:49.350
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.850
and this is my chance.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.750
Now ...

06:55.150 --> 06:57.450
Where to I find this Jack and Jill?

07:32.950 --> 07:35.650
Sorry, we have no rooms.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.750
I think one just overcomed.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.250
We'd like a complimentary continental breakfast.

07:50.350 --> 07:53.950
And do not even think about
skimping on them baby muffins!

07:54.250 --> 07:55.850
Jack and Jill Mr. and Mrs..

08:01.650 --> 08:04.450
We do not have any baby muffins!

08:09.750 --> 08:14.550
- You know, Jill, I've been thinking
- Uuhh! Get it out.

08:14.650 --> 08:18.950
I um...once we're done
with this magic bean business

08:19.050 --> 08:22.150
and got ourselves all them beautiful golden eggs.

08:22.650 --> 08:23.750
Mmhmm. Go on.

08:23.850 --> 08:28.050
Why don't we cut down on
some of the hijackin' and murderin'.

08:28.150 --> 08:30.050
I mean it's fun and all, but uh...

08:32.550 --> 08:34.650
... I want a baby.

08:40.350 --> 08:43.850
<i>- A baby what, Jack?
- A baby of ours, Jill.</i>

08:43.950 --> 08:47.050
<i>We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or somethin'.</i>

08:47.850 --> 08:52.350
Holy frijoles ...
They do exist!

08:53.050 --> 08:55.650
Ever since you fell on that hill and
broke your crown, you've been talking crazy

09:09.950 --> 09:12.350
Hey, what gives?

09:17.150 --> 09:19.150
No!

09:19.450 --> 09:22.450
You, you ... you stop where you are!

09:30.350 --> 09:32.950
Those beans are mine!

09:36.750 --> 09:38.050
Me?

09:39.150 --> 09:41.550
You, snap me?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.650
You snap me?!

09:57.950 --> 10:00.250
You looking for something?

10:04.850 --> 10:06.250
No.

10:07.050 --> 10:09.450
<i>No hablo Ingles.</i>

10:13.650 --> 10:16.150
You are going to pay for that!

10:57.450 --> 11:00.250
Chupacabra!

11:00.750 --> 11:03.050
- Chupacabra!
- You are crazy, woman!

11:57.550 --> 12:00.350
Those magic beans were my score.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.850
<i>You just caused me a chance
of getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.</i>

12:04.050 --> 12:05.550
Put up your paws up!

12:50.750 --> 12:52.050
Very well ...

12:52.150 --> 12:53.950
If it is to be a dance fight,

12:53.950 --> 12:57.350
Then I will tuesday night dance fight you
to the death!

13:18.750 --> 13:21.450
How dare you do the litter box on me!

13:47.850 --> 13:49.450
Can you feel me?

14:51.250 --> 14:53.350
Fear me if you dare!

15:24.750 --> 15:27.850
You hit me in the head with a guitar?

15:27.950 --> 15:30.150
You ... you are a woman?

15:36.250 --> 15:37.850
Amateur!

15:41.750 --> 15:43.850
Wow! Senorita, wait!

15:45.850 --> 15:50.350
Let me buy you some leche!
I am a lover not a...fighter.

15:54.150 --> 15:58.250
Hello? You are hiding from me?

15:58.850 --> 16:05.250
I like to play the games too.
I sense in you a kindred spirit.

16:09.950 --> 16:12.750
I smell something familiar.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.650
something dangerous.

16:18.950 --> 16:22.550
something breakfasty.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.950
It's been a long time, brother.

16:29.950 --> 16:31.450
Maldito Huevo!

16:35.250 --> 16:39.250
Humpty Alexander Dumpty...

16:39.650 --> 16:42.350
How dare you show your face to me!

16:43.150 --> 16:46.850
I know you're angry,
you have every right.

16:47.550 --> 16:49.950
But it is good to see you, Puss!

16:50.650 --> 16:51.950
Are those new boots?

16:52.050 --> 16:56.350
No! They are the same boots
I wore when you betrayed me.

16:56.550 --> 16:59.150
Be...betrayed you?

16:59.350 --> 17:02.850
You left me cracked in pieces on a bridge,
surrounded by soldiers.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.350
They wrote a song about it.

17:04.450 --> 17:07.750
And how did we get on that bridge
in the first place?!

17:07.850 --> 17:10.850
Because we were brothers and
brothers are supposed to look after each other. Not...

17:10.950 --> 17:12.350
Humpty

17:14.150 --> 17:16.250
Remember why we're here

17:17.350 --> 17:19.150
I should have known.

17:19.650 --> 17:23.750
I had the magic beans in
my grasp and you sent this very...

17:23.950 --> 17:27.150
attractive devil woman to interfere

17:27.250 --> 17:28.750
You are a curse on my life!

17:28.850 --> 17:30.650
Woh! Woh! Wait! Here me out, okay?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.350
Yes, yes! I sent Kitty to bring you here,

17:33.450 --> 17:36.050
But she is no ordinary thief.

17:37.350 --> 17:41.650
She's Kitty Softpaws.
The softest touch in Spain

17:41.650 --> 17:44.850
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

17:49.150 --> 17:51.550
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain ,

17:51.550 --> 17:53.350
we've got a fighting chance here.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.550
Puss, come on!

17:54.650 --> 17:57.150
You of all people know that nobody
is ever ripped off the giant's castle

17:57.150 --> 17:59.150
and lived to tell the tale.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.750
You want to survive,
you need a plan.

18:02.650 --> 18:05.650
And I've studied this job my whole life,

18:05.850 --> 18:07.150
you know that.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.550
Alright, let's...let's...let's be honest,

18:09.550 --> 18:12.350
without me you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

18:13.150 --> 18:15.850
But Jack and Jill do, they're on their way!

18:16.850 --> 18:19.250
We go up the beanstalk outlaws

18:19.350 --> 18:22.250
and we come down legends.

18:24.050 --> 18:27.650
So what do you say? Partner?

18:30.850 --> 18:34.050
No, never again.

18:35.550 --> 18:39.150
I'm sorry, okay?
How long are you going to hold a grudge?

18:39.250 --> 18:41.150
It's been seven years!

18:41.250 --> 18:43.650
That's like 35 cat years!

18:43.750 --> 18:45.650
You need me!

18:45.750 --> 18:48.350
And I...I need you, Puss.

18:48.950 --> 18:53.150
You got any idea what they do
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

18:57.250 --> 19:02.350
I'll tell you this, my friend.
It ain't over-easy!

19:06.650 --> 19:10.050
<i>Adios, Humpty Dumpty.!</i>

19:16.550 --> 19:18.450
This is bad, this is bad!

19:18.550 --> 19:22.850
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

19:23.050 --> 19:24.050
Such story,

19:24.150 --> 19:28.050
with your twisted lies...

19:28.150 --> 19:31.350
I should crack you open for it

19:42.450 --> 19:44.450
<i>Look what I found</i>

19:45.950 --> 19:48.450
Someone forgot his money!

19:52.250 --> 19:54.650
You are dangerous ...

19:55.450 --> 19:57.850
Humpty says you like danger.

20:00.550 --> 20:04.550
Just think of all trouble
we can get into ...

20:06.850 --> 20:09.550
The two of us, together,

20:09.650 --> 20:14.250
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

20:19.650 --> 20:24.250
- And... You owe me.
- I owe you?

20:25.150 --> 20:30.150
- You hit me in the head with a guitar.
- I regret the guitar.

20:30.350 --> 20:35.350
Okay, I forgive you.
So ... You're in?

20:36.750 --> 20:41.450
Only there's one tini tiny
itty bitty problem.

20:41.550 --> 20:45.950
- And what is that?
- You work ... for the egg!

20:47.050 --> 20:48.850
Oh, come on, Puss!

20:48.950 --> 20:52.250
What happened between you and Humpty
that was so bad?

20:54.650 --> 20:59.750
I am afraid with me and
Humpty the scars are too deep.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.550
It all started a long time ago.

21:07.650 --> 21:10.750
Oh, no! No! No! No! You really don't have to
tell me your whole life story, please!

21:10.850 --> 21:12.050
You may want to sit.

21:14.050 --> 21:19.750
- It is at times quite...painful.
- Okay, here we go.

21:20.850 --> 21:24.550
It was the year
in which the rain had not fallen.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.550
<i>The wind was big and
the basket was small.</i>

21:29.750 --> 21:31.750
<i>For days I bounced along</i>

21:31.850 --> 21:37.450
<i>A hungry little kitten with no milk,
no mama and no litter box.</i>

21:37.550 --> 21:41.650
<i>Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children..</i>

21:50.050 --> 21:52.550
<i>Her name was Imelda .</i>

21:52.650 --> 21:55.150
<i>and like a mother she took me
into her heart </i>

21:55.250 --> 21:57.050
<i>and raised me as her own.</i>

21:59.950 --> 22:01.350
Silensio ...

22:02.350 --> 22:03.450
Silensio!

22:03.550 --> 22:05.650
<i>She was an angel of kindness...</i>

22:05.850 --> 22:08.750
Silensio!

22:08.950 --> 22:10.350
<i>... most of the time.</i>

22:10.450 --> 22:14.050
I would like to introduce a new boy joining us.

22:14.150 --> 22:17.650
It's okay, pequeno. You show the face.

22:21.650 --> 22:23.150
Go on ...

22:28.550 --> 22:34.250
<i>- And uh...that was the moment I met...
- Humpty Alexander Dumpty.</i>

22:35.350 --> 22:38.850
Hey, whiskers!
You sit in the middle Boy Blue chair.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.250
Come on! Is this necessary?

22:41.350 --> 22:43.350
What don't you pick up somebody
your own size?

22:43.450 --> 22:45.150
Who asked you, breakfast?

22:45.250 --> 22:47.050
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue?

22:47.150 --> 22:50.450
If you going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

22:50.550 --> 22:53.050
- Let spin him!
- Please don't spin me!

22:53.450 --> 22:56.750
Not again! I'm gonna yolk!

22:56.850 --> 23:00.650
<i>Eventough he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me.</i>

23:00.750 --> 23:04.750
<i>and I decided that I would always
have his back.</i>

23:13.750 --> 23:16.150
That was very impressive! Thanks!

23:17.150 --> 23:18.450
Hey eggboy!

23:20.950 --> 23:25.050
<i>It was something about this strange
little egg that uh...intrigued me....</i>

23:42.350 --> 23:44.750
Oh, it's you...

23:44.850 --> 23:46.250
I've been collecting for months now.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.750
You never know when we're get lucky,
you know what I mean?

23:50.150 --> 23:53.050
Magic beans,
It's what they are.

23:54.450 --> 23:56.050
Hello?

23:56.150 --> 23:58.550
You going to tell all the other kids
that I believe in magic now?

23:58.650 --> 24:00.450
Is that what you're gonna do?

24:01.850 --> 24:04.450
No? What's your name?

24:05.350 --> 24:07.550
Well you don't say much, do you?

24:07.650 --> 24:10.150
Well I think I'll call you Sparky.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.250
Whiskers?

24:12.350 --> 24:14.150
Zoltar!

24:15.650 --> 24:18.050
How about Puss?

24:18.650 --> 24:22.450
<i>Humpty's mind was full of
imagination and invention.</i>

24:22.550 --> 24:24.350
What is it? 15 feet down there?

24:24.550 --> 24:27.050
Here we go. Give me a pu...

24:30.750 --> 24:33.050
I am flying!

24:35.950 --> 24:40.050
<i>He spoke of legends and adventures
beyond my wildest dreams.</i>

24:40.150 --> 24:45.850
Oh, when I find those magic beans,
they'll grow a vine straight up into the clouds ,

24:45.850 --> 24:50.150
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure, the golden goose

24:51.050 --> 24:53.050
Oh, the golden goose.

24:53.150 --> 25:00.250
Just one...just one of her golden eggs
could set me for life.

25:01.150 --> 25:02.950
It's my destiny, Puss.

25:03.050 --> 25:08.450
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.550
Well, this is awkward.

25:15.650 --> 25:18.650
This is kind of uh...
a solo dream here

25:19.250 --> 25:22.550
I don't really need a dead weight, you know?
Hold me down

25:24.350 --> 25:27.550
What are you doin'? Oh man, that's good.

25:27.650 --> 25:31.150
The...the...the eye thing that you're doin',
that is really splendid.

25:31.350 --> 25:34.550
Okay, let me just think for a second, alright?

25:35.650 --> 25:41.250
Okay, uh...this is crazy
but I am considering a partnership.

25:42.850 --> 25:45.150
I just need to know one thing.

25:45.650 --> 25:49.650
- Can you commit?
- Si, I can commit.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.950
Oh, you can talk!

25:52.050 --> 25:53.750
Could you help me up?

25:58.550 --> 26:03.650
First rule of bean club,
you do not talk about bean club.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.850
Second rule of bean club,

26:06.950 --> 26:09.850
you don't talk about bean club.

26:10.150 --> 26:12.150
- You ready?
- Ready.

26:12.750 --> 26:15.350
From this day forth, it shall be known.

26:15.650 --> 26:18.850
Never alone, always together.

26:18.950 --> 26:22.350
- Humpty and Puss...
- Brothers forever.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.550
<i>And from that moment on ,</i>

26:24.650 --> 26:28.950
<i>we were united on a great adventure
to find the magic beans.</i>

26:28.950 --> 26:30.450
Help me up!

26:30.650 --> 26:31.850
Paint me!

26:31.850 --> 26:33.850
<i>Humpty was the brain...</i>

26:34.850 --> 26:36.750
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

26:36.850 --> 26:37.750
It's really hurt!

26:37.850 --> 26:39.450
<i>...and I was the skill.</i>

26:43.750 --> 26:46.850
Well, we got red beans, we got green beans,
coffee beans, lima beans

26:46.950 --> 26:48.850
but no Magic Beans.

26:50.250 --> 26:53.150
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

26:53.750 --> 26:56.650
<i>Finding them meant everything to us.</i>

26:56.650 --> 26:59.050
Oh, I Almost forgot the most important thing.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.650
That's me and you, Puss...

27:02.950 --> 27:04.550
me and you.

27:04.850 --> 27:07.350
<i>But we never did find them.</i>

27:07.450 --> 27:10.750
<i>And as the years passed,
the quest for magic beans </i>

27:10.850 --> 27:14.950
<i>seemed more and more
like a dreams of a child.</i>

27:16.550 --> 27:19.950
<i>As teenagers, Humpty and I
looked for trouble</i>

27:20.950 --> 27:22.750
<i>and often found it.</i>

27:22.850 --> 27:27.050
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time, it's jail time.

27:27.050 --> 27:29.150
But they're just kids...

27:29.450 --> 27:31.950
They are thieves!

27:36.050 --> 27:41.850
You are better than this.
I believe in you with all my heart.

27:42.650 --> 27:44.950
Please do not let me down.

27:46.250 --> 27:50.550
I hate this place!
I can not wait for us to get out of here!

27:51.950 --> 27:54.150
Throw a rock! It'll make you feel better.

27:57.150 --> 27:58.850
Oh boy! we should go.

28:01.150 --> 28:03.250
<i>an instinct, I reacted</i>

28:16.850 --> 28:21.050
- He saves the commandante's mother!
- He saves the commandante's mother!

28:26.550 --> 28:29.550
You saved my mother!

28:29.550 --> 28:30.650
Senor Puss,

28:30.750 --> 28:33.550
He is a hero!

28:34.650 --> 28:39.050
Today we see the courage and bravery!

28:41.150 --> 28:45.750
<i>Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.</i>

28:45.950 --> 28:48.650
These are for you, my boy.

28:49.050 --> 28:53.350
Wear them as a symbol of honor and justice.

28:54.050 --> 28:57.150
I will make you proud, mama.

28:57.550 --> 29:02.250
You already have. My Puss in Boots.

29:04.750 --> 29:08.250
<i>How strange it was to be a cat in boots,</i>

29:08.250 --> 29:10.950
<i>but woh, I look good!</i>

29:11.450 --> 29:14.150
<i>And as the light of my path grew brighter,</i>

29:15.250 --> 29:19.050
<i>Humpty's road grew ever darker.</i>

29:25.350 --> 29:27.050
Gracias, Commandante!

29:27.150 --> 29:30.250
Be careful of the company you keep.

29:31.750 --> 29:34.950
I know. I know. I never should have tried
something without you.

29:35.050 --> 29:38.450
You're not stealing lollipops anymore, Humpty.
This is getting serious.

29:38.550 --> 29:41.050
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

29:41.150 --> 29:43.550
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

29:43.650 --> 29:46.350
I've been casing the silver smith
and it's perfect.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.950
You and me, in and out, fifty seconds tops!

29:48.950 --> 29:50.550
Will you put that away!

29:50.650 --> 29:54.750
This is our home,
these people have done nothing to us.

29:54.850 --> 29:58.250
Our home?
Okay, yeah. I get it now.

29:58.350 --> 30:01.850
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

30:01.950 --> 30:05.650
- That is not true.
- We weren't born here. We're orphans...

30:05.950 --> 30:09.850
- and all we got is each other. You understand?
- We are better than this.

30:10.850 --> 30:14.450
- But we're partners.
- We are brothers!

30:15.550 --> 30:18.850
But I am not stealing anymore.

30:20.550 --> 30:23.150
<i>But Humpty would not give up so easily.</i>

30:23.950 --> 30:25.450
I'm in trouble, Puss!

30:25.450 --> 30:27.850
It's boy blue and his gang
I owe him some money.

30:27.850 --> 30:30.150
They're coming for me,
just get me over this wall!

30:30.250 --> 30:32.550
We got to go!
Help me up the wall! Hurry!

30:45.450 --> 30:47.750
Okay, I got everything!
We did it! Come on, let's go!

30:47.850 --> 30:50.550
- How could you do this to me?
- I did you a favor!

30:50.650 --> 30:53.550
- We can finally get out of here.
- This is the money of the people.

30:53.650 --> 30:55.050
This is all they have!

30:59.350 --> 31:03.550
- You disgrace those boots.
- Comandate, please! I can explain.

31:03.550 --> 31:05.050
Arrest them!

31:09.150 --> 31:11.050
Hurry up! Go to the bridge!

31:11.450 --> 31:14.350
- You tricked me!
- I had too! You left me no choice!

31:23.650 --> 31:25.150
Mama ...

31:25.250 --> 31:26.850
Pequeno

31:27.650 --> 31:28.750
Watch out!

31:44.850 --> 31:46.450
Oh no ...

31:46.550 --> 31:50.750
Puss, I can't get up.
Puss, help me I can't get up!

31:51.150 --> 31:52.750
Freeze!

31:53.150 --> 31:57.250
- Puss, save me!
- Save yourself!

32:14.250 --> 32:18.250
<i>I lost everything I cared about that day.</i>

32:19.050 --> 32:23.650
<i>My brother, my honor, my home...</i>

32:25.750 --> 32:30.250
<i>All I thought about was
the disappointment in my mama's eyes.</i>

32:31.750 --> 32:34.250
And I have been running ever since.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.850
The egg betrayed me.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.750
His lies cost me everything.

32:47.650 --> 32:49.450
I'm awake!

32:49.550 --> 32:52.050
You think I don't want to fix the past?

32:55.150 --> 32:57.150
I can't get down.

33:05.850 --> 33:11.350
Listen, a day...a day doesn't go by
when I don't think about what I lost.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.350
I lost my best friend ...

33:17.050 --> 33:18.850
my only friend.

33:19.250 --> 33:22.350
And I get it now, I got greedy and
desperate and I let you down.

33:22.450 --> 33:24.450
I let myself down.

33:24.650 --> 33:27.450
All I'm asking for, Puss, is a second chance.

33:27.450 --> 33:31.650
Give me that second chance
and I'll help repay you back San Ricardo.

33:32.550 --> 33:37.550
Please, Puss. Let me show you
what our friendship mean to me.

33:42.450 --> 33:45.250
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great!

33:45.550 --> 33:48.850
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo.

33:48.850 --> 33:50.350
Not for you.

33:50.450 --> 33:54.050
We are not partners
and we're not friends.

33:54.950 --> 34:00.250
Okay and I...I promise this time
I will not let you down.

34:00.950 --> 34:05.150
Yes! I think we got our bean club back!

34:26.250 --> 34:30.650
- This plan better work.
- Listen, you just need to worry about your part. .

34:30.750 --> 34:32.450
Don't screw it up!

34:33.050 --> 34:35.150
- What?
- Again with the mask?

34:35.250 --> 34:38.550
I don't need style advice from Mr. Dusty Boots.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.450
Come on, Puss! Now!

34:52.450 --> 34:54.950
Our biological clocks are tickin', darlin'.

34:55.050 --> 34:56.750
You gotta start lookin' at the big picture.

34:56.850 --> 34:58.250
What's the problem?

34:58.950 --> 35:01.250
Listen, I put a lot of work into my body.

35:01.350 --> 35:04.550
I look good and I am not
just gonna throw it away.

35:08.850 --> 35:10.750
- What?
- Look!

35:14.950 --> 35:16.550
Excellent!

35:20.250 --> 35:22.750
I have no time to be at home
with no diapers and veggie stocks.

35:23.050 --> 35:25.850
You don't have to, Jill.
I will be the stay at home dad.

35:25.950 --> 35:28.450
We have 10 hungry piggies there on the back.

35:28.550 --> 35:31.450
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them!

35:32.450 --> 35:33.750
You've got to hurry!

35:35.650 --> 35:39.750
- Why are you not using your claws?
- Would you please just shut up? I'm on it!

35:39.750 --> 35:42.150
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet!

35:42.150 --> 35:45.150
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, right?

35:54.050 --> 35:56.750
Was that 'em hog?
There, there, sleepy sleepy big fat piggy...

36:01.150 --> 36:02.850
You babysit.

36:03.550 --> 36:05.050
Soft paws.

36:08.650 --> 36:10.250
Well ...

36:11.850 --> 36:14.250
Hello beans of legend!

36:14.650 --> 36:16.050
Let's go!

36:24.850 --> 36:28.550
Look at what we have here, Jill.

36:28.650 --> 36:35.050
- You mess with our baby!
- And you took my beans!

36:37.250 --> 36:38.850
Soft paws bomb!

36:43.850 --> 36:47.350
You'll gonna pay for this, cat!

36:49.250 --> 36:51.150
Signal the egg!

36:52.250 --> 36:53.150
Yes!

36:58.050 --> 36:59.550
- Okay!
- Ready?

36:59.650 --> 37:01.550
Set ... Go!

37:36.584 --> 37:39.003
Well let's find out!

37:37.350 --> 37:40.150
Alright, cat! Give me them beans!

37:41.150 --> 37:44.650
Is it true, a cat always lands on its feet?

37:44.750 --> 37:47.250
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

37:57.250 --> 37:59.050
See I told you I won't let you down!

37:59.550 --> 38:01.250
You think this is over?

38:08.250 --> 38:09.750
Hey, that was close!

38:19.650 --> 38:20.850
Now!

38:23.650 --> 38:25.550
We just gonna make it to that bridge!

38:25.750 --> 38:27.250
Hang on!

38:28.750 --> 38:31.450
Humpty, There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

38:37.550 --> 38:38.850
Humpty!

38:44.250 --> 38:46.050
We're going to die!

38:58.550 --> 39:01.950
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

39:10.850 --> 39:14.650
Giants Castle, here we come!

39:17.250 --> 39:21.150
i must hand it to the egg.
This was a team effort.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.650
Humpty's team had its claws ...

39:22.950 --> 39:25.150
I mean flaws...
What i meant was...

39:25.250 --> 39:27.750
Not claws, he's not a cat.

39:27.950 --> 39:29.950
Not to say there is anything wrong ...

39:30.050 --> 39:32.350
- I don't want to talk about it!
- Got it.

39:33.850 --> 39:35.550
Okay, We should be close.

39:37.050 --> 39:39.550
Keep your eyes up for
any strange cloud activity.

39:39.950 --> 39:41.650
I am called Kitty Softpaws

39:41.650 --> 39:45.150
because I'll steal you blind
and you'll never even know I was there.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.150
Kitty,

39:54.250 --> 39:56.850
you're not as good as they say.

39:58.150 --> 40:00.150
You're better!

40:03.050 --> 40:05.650
I will respect your privacy.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.350
All right. I'll tell you.

40:13.150 --> 40:18.050
I was just a stray, but I had beautiful claws.

40:19.250 --> 40:23.450
One day a really nice couple took me in,

40:23.550 --> 40:27.450
gave me milk every morning, loved me.

40:29.250 --> 40:33.950
Maybe I scratched her curtains
or play too rough with the hamster.

40:34.550 --> 40:39.550
I don't know why they did it,
but they took my claws.

40:41.250 --> 40:43.750
Cat people are crazy.

40:45.250 --> 40:47.850
Stop! Stop the cart!
I think this is it!

41:07.750 --> 41:12.150
Can you believe it, Puss?
After all this years...

41:11.932 --> 41:14.351
That is a strange cloud.

41:13.950 --> 41:17.050
Here! I want you to plant them.

41:28.350 --> 41:31.550
Okay, this is it! It's happening! Hurry!

41:34.850 --> 41:36.150
This way!

41:36.350 --> 41:38.050
Come on!

41:38.350 --> 41:42.750
Right Here!

41:45.650 --> 41:47.450
Now, place the beans.

41:48.750 --> 41:52.550
Place beans carefully please
not on top of each other!

41:52.550 --> 41:54.450
Magic is very delicate.

41:54.550 --> 41:58.650
Ok, good! Very good.
Now, just stand back.

42:42.150 --> 42:43.250
What's happening here?

42:43.250 --> 42:46.650
- Maybe the magic rubbed off in your pocket.
- That's impossible!

42:46.650 --> 42:48.550
Okay. Okay. Let's not panic.

42:48.650 --> 42:51.850
You know I read somewhere that plants
have feelings, so ...

42:51.950 --> 42:54.750
come on. Say something nice to it.

42:54.750 --> 43:00.250
Okay. Let me just think for a second.
Hi, little plant!

44:21.250 --> 44:22.850
Uh...guys

44:23.550 --> 44:25.050
Humpty!

44:25.650 --> 44:28.950
- I do not see him. Did you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

44:29.150 --> 44:31.550
You sound...weird.

44:32.550 --> 44:38.850
It's the thin air!
Come on in, it feels great!

44:45.550 --> 44:47.950
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

44:48.750 --> 44:51.450
It's because the upper vest.
Who knew?

44:58.150 --> 44:59.250
Come on!

45:17.150 --> 45:18.450
Gotcha!

45:22.250 --> 45:23.750
Meow!

45:24.550 --> 45:28.050
Hey Puss, what do you think?
Do I shave?

45:28.950 --> 45:30.550
Let me show you something.

45:37.550 --> 45:42.350
Somewhere down there, there are two little kids.
I don't know, maybe orphans,

45:42.450 --> 45:47.150
and they're laying on a hill staring at the clouds
dreaming about the future.

45:47.950 --> 45:50.150
That was me and you, Puss.

45:50.550 --> 45:53.350
Me and you.

45:54.750 --> 45:58.850
Boys, you might wanna take a look at this.

46:02.850 --> 46:05.250
The giants castle!

46:08.450 --> 46:11.550
- Okay, time to suit up.
- Humpty!

46:11.950 --> 46:14.350
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs!

46:17.750 --> 46:22.650
- Brilliant or what, huh?
- Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

46:23.750 --> 46:27.250
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

46:29.950 --> 46:32.650
Puss remember when everyone
was laughing at bean club?

46:32.650 --> 46:34.550
And who is laughing now? We are!

47:00.650 --> 47:03.450
That is our target.

47:04.450 --> 47:07.950
- Hey, you don't sound like an elf anymore.
- It's because the air pressure in here is normal.

47:08.050 --> 47:09.350
Let's go!

47:12.950 --> 47:15.350
So here is the plan:
You two get the golden eggs

47:15.450 --> 47:18.350
- I will fight the giant.
- There's no giant to fight.

47:18.450 --> 47:19.970
- The giant's been dead for years.
- What? You didn't do the reading, did you? Oh, boy!

47:22.250 --> 47:23.350
Jack and the Beanstalk.

47:23.450 --> 47:25.350
Chapter 14,
Giant takes a big dirt nap.

47:26.150 --> 47:27.650
Ah, ankle burn!

47:30.550 --> 47:33.350
- What was that?
- They call it The Great Terror.

47:33.450 --> 47:35.950
It's the monster that guards the golden goose.

47:36.150 --> 47:38.650
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

47:38.750 --> 47:42.050
But nobody really knows,
because nobody's walked away from it alive.

47:42.350 --> 47:44.250
Follow me and keep quite.

47:54.950 --> 47:56.850
- Shh! Humpty!
- I can't...I can't help it!

47:56.950 --> 48:00.550
Everything's rubbing and pinching!
I need powder!

48:17.050 --> 48:19.050
How are we gonna got across?

48:19.350 --> 48:20.650
Champagne!

48:24.250 --> 48:25.250
Cheers!

48:37.250 --> 48:39.650
Do not worry! I will protect you!

48:41.950 --> 48:44.950
What you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

48:45.550 --> 48:48.850
Please, stop bringing up the guitar.

49:06.750 --> 49:07.950
Catch me!

49:10.950 --> 49:12.150
Hurry!

49:13.150 --> 49:14.650
Hide!

49:15.650 --> 49:17.050
Don't look at it!

49:22.550 --> 49:24.450
Be quiet!

49:30.050 --> 49:31.850
You got to get it together!

49:31.950 --> 49:34.250
- Come on!
- Okay.

49:49.250 --> 49:52.750
Look at this! It's egg paradise!

49:54.050 --> 49:56.950
Oh, it's so beautiful. I feel like I belong here!

50:03.150 --> 50:04.350
Golden Eggs!

50:06.750 --> 50:08.250
It'll be a lot of chicken!

50:10.150 --> 50:12.950
I thought they were going to be like chicken size!

50:13.150 --> 50:17.450
Can you imagine laying one of this?
Ouch!

50:17.550 --> 50:19.150
Puss!

50:22.050 --> 50:24.350
- How do you suppose to get these out of here?
- I do not know!

50:27.750 --> 50:29.350
Oh my!

50:33.550 --> 50:35.350
The Golden Goose!

50:36.850 --> 50:38.350
Just look at her!

50:38.450 --> 50:39.950
Isn't she beautiful?

50:51.250 --> 50:52.650
My sweet darling!

50:54.850 --> 50:56.550
I think she likes you!

50:59.550 --> 51:00.750
Let's just take her.

51:00.850 --> 51:04.750
Wait a minute! That's the goose of legend.
We do not know what happens if we take her.

51:05.550 --> 51:07.350
I know what happen
if we don't take her.

51:07.550 --> 51:08.950
We got nothing!

51:09.050 --> 51:13.550
Guys! Guys! It's a gold pooper!
We're taking it!

51:23.050 --> 51:24.250
Almost there!

51:27.250 --> 51:28.250
Hang on!

51:56.450 --> 51:57.950
It's coming!

51:58.050 --> 51:59.650
Run!

52:15.250 --> 52:16.550
Kitty!

52:18.750 --> 52:20.350
What are you doing?

52:43.050 --> 52:44.350
Hang on!

52:48.950 --> 52:50.450
Come here you!

52:54.250 --> 52:55.450
Gotcha!

52:56.350 --> 52:57.950
She's mine now!

53:07.950 --> 53:09.450
Hello!

53:14.850 --> 53:17.850
No! Fly little gosling, fly!

53:22.250 --> 53:25.150
Desn't meant to be this way!

53:27.050 --> 53:29.050
- Puss?
- No.

53:37.750 --> 53:39.450
I'm sorry!

53:54.050 --> 53:56.150
Thanks, Ranger.

54:03.350 --> 54:05.250
We should maybe cut that down.

54:09.650 --> 54:13.350
Look at that! You finally got
that family you wanted, Jack.

54:13.450 --> 54:17.250
You here that? I think it just called me daddy.

54:17.450 --> 54:21.250
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

54:31.650 --> 54:33.550
Well, what is it?

54:44.050 --> 54:46.450
I do believe that's our cue.

54:51.750 --> 54:53.750
To paying back San Ricardo!

54:53.750 --> 54:55.650
To being rich!

55:11.550 --> 55:12.450
You!

55:12.650 --> 55:13.950
Me?

55:14.050 --> 55:15.950
Yeah, yeah, baby!

55:18.650 --> 55:19.950
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

55:20.150 --> 55:23.150
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!
One, two ...

55:23.350 --> 55:24.450
What?

55:26.050 --> 55:28.065
There is one word for you, Kitty Softpaws.
Me-wow!

55:30.450 --> 55:35.050
I know you have quite a reputation with the ladies,
Mr. Frisky Two Times.

55:35.150 --> 55:38.150
I've also been knowns as The Fury Lover!

55:40.450 --> 55:42.350
But that was before I met you.

55:42.650 --> 55:46.250
You don't know me, Puss.
I'm not who you think I am.

55:46.450 --> 55:47.950
I'm all about the score.

55:48.050 --> 55:52.850
Come on! Look me in the eyes
and tell me all you care about is the gold?

55:53.850 --> 55:56.850
- Puss ...
- Kitty ...

55:57.750 --> 55:58.850
Oh my God!

56:00.850 --> 56:02.350
New partners!

56:02.950 --> 56:05.050
Do not fall for his animal magnetism!

56:05.250 --> 56:06.950
Stay focused!

56:08.250 --> 56:09.250
What?

56:17.950 --> 56:20.850
So, I have been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

56:20.950 --> 56:22.350
that when we go our separate ways

56:22.450 --> 56:26.550
we can go our separate ways together.

56:28.350 --> 56:30.650
Puss, you have to go now!

56:30.750 --> 56:34.350
You do not have to push me away anymore.
You can trust me.

56:34.450 --> 56:35.250
But ...

56:35.450 --> 56:40.450
Give it up for the legend of San Ricardo!
Humpty and Puss, we did it!

56:41.750 --> 56:45.250
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty, stay up with us

56:45.350 --> 56:49.450
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

56:49.950 --> 56:52.450
Okay, yeah! Have fun with that!

56:52.850 --> 56:55.050
We should give her some privacy.

56:57.550 --> 57:00.450
I never thought we would get here,

57:01.550 --> 57:06.450
after all we went through.
To pull this off together.

57:08.050 --> 57:11.150
It is good to have my brother back.

57:11.250 --> 57:14.085
Yep, it sure is. Well, we have a big day tomorrow.
Really exciting stuff.

57:20.250 --> 57:22.350
We should get some rest.

57:23.550 --> 57:25.750
Good night, Humpty!

57:32.150 --> 57:33.850
Que nesta!

58:05.550 --> 58:08.050
I'm still alive!

58:12.550 --> 58:14.950
Jack and Jill!

58:15.750 --> 58:17.050
Kitty!

58:17.550 --> 58:19.350
Humpty?

58:21.050 --> 58:23.850
I will find you!

58:27.350 --> 58:29.250
Get out of here!

59:23.550 --> 59:24.750
Be gone!

59:26.250 --> 59:29.350
What do you...what do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

59:29.550 --> 59:32.650
Jack, egg's tryin' to bribe us.

59:32.750 --> 59:36.850
- Hah, with our own gold.
- Come on now. All we want is a little breakfast.

59:36.950 --> 59:39.650
- No! No! No! Please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

59:39.850 --> 59:41.850
Humpty! No!

59:47.350 --> 59:51.250
- Hello, Puss!
- Surprise!

59:53.950 --> 59:55.250
What is going on?

59:55.350 --> 59:59.450
It's a surprise party and the surprise
is on you!

59:59.650 --> 1:00:02.350
Looks like cat's out of the bag.

1:00:02.550 --> 1:00:06.050
- You were in cahoots?
- Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

1:00:09.550 --> 1:00:13.650
I spend a lot of time in the prison
preparing for this.

1:00:13.750 --> 1:00:16.450
- You set me up?
- Oh, yeah! Set you up? Of course!

1:00:16.550 --> 1:00:18.450
You think this was all about getting the gold

1:00:18.550 --> 1:00:20.250
and clearing your name?

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:25.850
This little adventure was about one thing.

1:00:26.550 --> 1:00:28.550
Revenge!

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:34.450
You never knew it, Puss. But I was always there.

1:00:54.950 --> 1:00:57.750
You wanted to repay and old debt, Puss?

1:00:57.850 --> 1:00:59.450
Well so did I.

1:00:59.450 --> 1:01:00.550
Why would you do this?

1:01:00.650 --> 1:01:04.350
You left me on that bridge! You abandoned me
when I needed you the most!

1:01:04.450 --> 1:01:07.050
- What happened to brothers forever?
- I trusted you!

1:01:07.150 --> 1:01:08.250
Well now you're finally gonna know
what it feels like.

1:01:08.450 --> 1:01:12.250
You know? To trust someone
and have them stab you in the back!

1:01:12.350 --> 1:01:13.950
Guards!

1:01:14.750 --> 1:01:19.250
Puss in Boots, you are under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo bank.

1:01:19.350 --> 1:01:21.450
Consider this the final meeting of bean club.

1:01:21.550 --> 1:01:23.650
I should scramble you with onions!

1:01:23.950 --> 1:01:26.850
You should never have come back!

1:01:29.250 --> 1:01:31.350
Pequeno! Wait!

1:01:31.550 --> 1:01:36.650
- Do not fight them, please.
- Mom, listen to me! I can explain.

1:01:36.750 --> 1:01:40.850
No! Puss, not more running!

1:01:40.950 --> 1:01:45.650
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

1:01:48.650 --> 1:01:53.250
I'm sorry, Mama. I let you down.

1:01:56.150 --> 1:01:58.550
Paws where we can see them!

1:01:59.250 --> 1:02:01.350
Turn around... slow!

1:02:03.450 --> 1:02:05.250
Guard!

1:02:11.550 --> 1:02:15.150
Step into the carrier! Quietlike!

1:02:22.550 --> 1:02:26.250
Attention, attention everyone,
If you could move a little closer!

1:02:26.350 --> 1:02:32.350
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
legendary the golden goose of legend!

1:02:36.350 --> 1:02:39.650
Kitty? Not you too.

1:02:45.150 --> 1:02:47.050
Gold for everyone!

1:02:49.450 --> 1:02:52.250
We got some fresh hot gold here,
folks!

1:02:52.350 --> 1:02:56.150
Step right up!
Get it hot!

1:03:06.750 --> 1:03:13.550
One hat. One belt. And two boots...

1:03:13.650 --> 1:03:16.450
... Once a symbol of honor.

1:03:17.250 --> 1:03:20.650
One bottle of catnap...

1:03:21.250 --> 1:03:23.550
Uh...it is for my glaucoma.

1:03:26.650 --> 1:03:30.550
This is where you belong, outlaw!

1:03:30.650 --> 1:03:35.350
And this is where you will stay forever.

1:03:52.650 --> 1:03:56.050
Don't stop on my account.

1:04:07.750 --> 1:04:12.250
It looks like the egg got what he wanted.

1:04:12.250 --> 1:04:15.550
- You talking about Humpty?
- Ublee..ublee...umm! Don't say his name!

1:04:15.650 --> 1:04:19.150
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

1:04:19.250 --> 1:04:22.450
Happiest day of my life was when he left.

1:04:22.650 --> 1:04:25.350
till I realized he stole my magic beans.

1:04:25.550 --> 1:04:28.650
Wait! Wait! Wait! You had the beans?
Who are you?

1:04:30.250 --> 1:04:32.150
Hey! What's your name?

1:04:32.450 --> 1:04:35.850
Uuh! Andy Beanstalk,
my parents call me Jack.

1:04:35.950 --> 1:04:39.950
I traded the family cow for them beans.

1:04:40.050 --> 1:04:43.450
Of course it wasn't my family's cow,
some others family's family cow.

1:04:43.550 --> 1:04:45.150
That's why I got eight to ten year.

1:04:45.250 --> 1:04:49.050
Always know which cow's you're...

1:04:50.350 --> 1:04:54.550
Crazy man! Wake up!
What else do you know?

1:04:54.650 --> 1:04:58.450
We're all goners! Thanks to that little stinky.

1:04:58.550 --> 1:05:03.650
I told him! I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge.

1:05:03.750 --> 1:05:05.850
Don't take the goose. Why?

1:05:09.450 --> 1:05:13.950
The Great Terror! That's the golden goose's mom.

1:05:14.150 --> 1:05:15.150
Oh, no.

1:05:15.250 --> 1:05:21.350
And she will be out for blood
when she comes back for her baby!

1:05:22.250 --> 1:05:25.050
Guard! San Ricardo is
in terrible danger!

1:05:25.150 --> 1:05:27.850
- You must listen to me!
- Quiet you!

1:05:51.550 --> 1:05:53.450
Shut up!

1:06:10.750 --> 1:06:13.650
Open the door ...

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:22.250
Drop the weapon!

1:06:23.450 --> 1:06:25.350
Very good!

1:06:25.450 --> 1:06:27.550
Step aside!

1:06:28.050 --> 1:06:31.350
No! Diablo gato!

1:06:32.650 --> 1:06:34.350
Nice try!

1:06:46.450 --> 1:06:48.850
I hope you can forgive me.

1:06:49.050 --> 1:06:51.350
Apology accepted!

1:06:52.650 --> 1:06:54.150
I don't really have time for you.

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:56.950
I have to save the town from The Great Terror.

1:06:57.050 --> 1:07:00.950
Wait, Puss!
Don't you see, I'm here because...

1:07:01.050 --> 1:07:04.350
I am here because you made me realize

1:07:04.450 --> 1:07:08.650
that there is something I can care about more than gold.

1:07:09.050 --> 1:07:13.750
- Some thing?
- Okay, someone.

1:07:13.850 --> 1:07:16.850
He's about two feet tall, wears high heels.

1:07:16.950 --> 1:07:20.450
- Handsome?
- He's very handsome!

1:07:20.550 --> 1:07:22.450
A real beefcake?

1:07:22.550 --> 1:07:23.649
- A stallion? Yes.
- Tiger? Oh, brother ...

1:07:27.150 --> 1:07:29.550
But, this does not make us even.

1:07:29.650 --> 1:07:30.950
Freeze!

1:07:31.050 --> 1:07:34.650
- Yes it does!
- No, it doesn't!

1:07:38.550 --> 1:07:42.650
I saved you!
You owed me one.

1:07:43.350 --> 1:07:45.350
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

1:07:47.150 --> 1:07:49.350
So now you owe me two.

1:07:53.050 --> 1:07:56.650
- Oh, you are a lot of work.
- I know, but I am worth it!

1:08:00.750 --> 1:08:03.350
You are not getting away, Puss in boots!

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:05.650
Oh boots!

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:09.450
- Kitty!
- Now we're even!

1:08:17.550 --> 1:08:20.250
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

1:08:20.350 --> 1:08:22.950
The chances of giant goose
destroying the town ...

1:08:23.250 --> 1:08:25.150
100%
... 100%.

1:08:29.250 --> 1:08:32.450
<i>never alone. Always together.</i>

1:08:32.550 --> 1:08:36.350
<i>- Humpty and Puss ...
- Brother forever</i>

1:08:38.750 --> 1:08:42.850
Come on, sweetie. Let's get out of here
come before Momma shows up.

1:08:43.850 --> 1:08:47.050
I shall make you into an egg salad sandwich!

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:49.450
Aah! That is disgusting!

1:08:49.550 --> 1:08:53.250
- Give me the goose, Humpty!
- No can do, I'm afraid.

1:08:53.350 --> 1:08:55.250
See the mama's on her way and when she gets here,

1:08:55.450 --> 1:08:59.550
it's bye bye San Ricardo and everything
you ever cared about.

1:08:59.750 --> 1:09:02.950
Revenge on me is one thing;
but why Imelda?

1:09:02.950 --> 1:09:05.750
Why the orphanage?
This is our home!

1:09:05.850 --> 1:09:07.550
You mean your home!

1:09:09.550 --> 1:09:11.850
I...I never belonged here.

1:09:12.050 --> 1:09:13.450
We had a plan to get out of here,

1:09:13.550 --> 1:09:17.150
but then you became a hero
and you picked this place over me.

1:09:18.950 --> 1:09:21.250
You left me with nothing!

1:09:25.750 --> 1:09:29.250
Humpty, I'm sorry I hurt you.

1:09:31.050 --> 1:09:35.250
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this.

1:09:36.450 --> 1:09:37.950
No, I'm not.

1:09:38.050 --> 1:09:40.350
Oh, come on! I know the real Humpty.

1:09:40.450 --> 1:09:44.950
The way you saw the world,
the inventor, the dreamer.

1:09:45.050 --> 1:09:47.650
What happened to that guy?

1:09:52.850 --> 1:09:55.050
I think it's too late!

1:09:55.150 --> 1:09:57.450
It is never too late to do the right thing.

1:09:57.550 --> 1:09:59.750
Together, we can save San Ricardo.

1:10:05.650 --> 1:10:10.050
I can forgive you, Humpty, if you help me now.
I'll try!

1:10:10.150 --> 1:10:14.086
- Really? After everything put you through?
- Prove to me there is still a good egg in you!

1:10:59.150 --> 1:11:01.350
Run!

1:11:12.950 --> 1:11:14.050
Googles ... check.

1:11:14.150 --> 1:11:16.750
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

1:11:16.850 --> 1:11:19.550
Give me a puuuu!

1:11:43.750 --> 1:11:44.850
Mother Goose!

1:11:49.150 --> 1:11:54.250
Wait! Just follow me and
I'll lead you to your baby!

1:11:59.050 --> 1:12:01.550
No! Not that way!

1:12:03.850 --> 1:12:05.850
Pequeno! Help!

1:12:05.950 --> 1:12:07.350
Hang on!

1:12:07.950 --> 1:12:09.350
I got you!

1:12:16.250 --> 1:12:18.350
That's my boy!

1:12:22.950 --> 1:12:27.050
Come with me, mamam goose!
I know where your baby is! Here!

1:12:39.150 --> 1:12:44.150
- Humpty, Pick up the pace!
- I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

1:12:49.350 --> 1:12:52.550
Sorry, Egghead.
We want more than just egg.

1:12:52.650 --> 1:12:54.450
So how about give us that goose?

1:12:54.550 --> 1:12:55.850
Humpty!

1:13:00.050 --> 1:13:03.350
- Nice moves!
- What would you do without me?

1:13:08.450 --> 1:13:09.850
Freeze!

1:13:12.450 --> 1:13:16.150
Commandante! I can explain!

1:13:16.550 --> 1:13:21.850
Gato, you are going back to jail,
if it's the last thing I do!

1:13:21.950 --> 1:13:23.550
Humpty, hurry!

1:13:23.750 --> 1:13:26.350
We're almost there!

1:13:48.750 --> 1:13:53.050
- Puss! Help!
- Humpty! Hang on!

1:14:04.250 --> 1:14:07.350
Here we are again. Right, Puss?

1:14:09.550 --> 1:14:13.150
I will not leave you behind this time, Humpty.

1:14:21.650 --> 1:14:23.350
I'm sorry, Puss.

1:14:23.450 --> 1:14:28.150
I've made a mess out of everything.
I am a rotten egg!

1:14:28.950 --> 1:14:35.850
I'm not...I'm not a person. I'm not a bird,
I'm not even a food.

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:39.050
I don't know what I am!

1:14:39.250 --> 1:14:44.050
You are what you have always been, my brother!

1:14:46.550 --> 1:14:49.150
Brothers forever!

1:15:01.650 --> 1:15:05.650
- You can't save us both!
- Yes, I can. Just hang on!

1:15:06.850 --> 1:15:12.250
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

1:15:13.950 --> 1:15:16.450
It's the right thing to do.

1:15:19.150 --> 1:15:22.050
I will not let you go, Humpty!

1:15:22.750 --> 1:15:26.850
I know you won't, so I won't make you choose.

1:15:28.750 --> 1:15:30.150
Humpty!

1:15:51.550 --> 1:15:54.750
I'm very sorry. She's okay!

1:16:02.650 --> 1:16:04.950
Humpty,

1:16:22.750 --> 1:16:26.550
I always knew that you were good inside.

1:16:40.250 --> 1:16:43.050
Goodbye, Humpty.

1:16:56.650 --> 1:16:58.450
It's him, Puss in boots!

1:16:58.650 --> 1:17:02.450
- He saved us from the giant goose!
- His sword is like lightning!

1:17:02.650 --> 1:17:04.450
They said he has ten lives!

1:17:04.550 --> 1:17:08.250
His boots are made
of the finest leather!

1:17:08.450 --> 1:17:10.750
He drinks whole milk.

1:17:14.250 --> 1:17:15.750
Good legend!

1:17:15.850 --> 1:17:19.350
He is no outlaw. He saved us!

1:17:20.450 --> 1:17:22.150
Meow!

1:17:23.250 --> 1:17:26.050
A gift for you, Mama.

1:17:28.650 --> 1:17:31.950
I have to go,
the soldiers are coming for me.

1:17:34.750 --> 1:17:37.450
I am so proud of you, my son.

1:17:39.850 --> 1:17:44.350
Today you faced the past with bravery and honor.

1:17:44.650 --> 1:17:47.339
You earned those boots and the people know
that you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

1:17:53.850 --> 1:17:56.350
I did it for you, Mom.

1:17:56.750 --> 1:18:02.950
- You will always be in my heart!
- And you in mine.

1:18:04.050 --> 1:18:06.250
Gato!

1:18:06.450 --> 1:18:09.150
Here he is! I see him!

1:18:50.950 --> 1:18:56.750
- I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!
- Sooner than you think.

1:19:04.850 --> 1:19:07.550
She is a bad kitty!

1:19:12.550 --> 1:19:16.350
<i>This is the story of a cat who became a hero,</i>

1:19:16.450 --> 1:19:21.050
<i>An outlaw dedicated to justice
and a lover of beautiful women.</i>

1:19:21.250 --> 1:19:27.550
<i>A great, great lover...
Really, it is crazy</i>

1:19:28.050 --> 1:19:30.850
<i>I am Puss in Boots</i>

1:19:30.950 --> 1:19:35.650
<i>And my name would become legend.</i>

1:20:52.422 --> 1:20:57.422
