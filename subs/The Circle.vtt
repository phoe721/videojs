WEBVTT

02:00.010 --> 02:01.386
Yes, we received your payment.

02:02.471 --> 02:08.602
No, it wasn't late, but it was for $78.13,
and the bill was for $78.31.

02:10.187 --> 02:12.272
Okay, great.

02:15.150 --> 02:17.194
No, thank you.

03:03.949 --> 03:05.659
I think it's the intake manifold.

03:08.328 --> 03:10.789
- Was I right?
- Not even close.

03:12.457 --> 03:15.919
I think I just like saying
"intake manifold."

03:16.002 --> 03:18.630
Maybe when I get a job,
I'll get Triple A.

03:18.713 --> 03:20.590
I thought you worked
at the water company.

03:20.674 --> 03:21.674
Temping.

03:23.343 --> 03:26.179
- How's your parents?
- They're doing okay.

03:27.806 --> 03:30.725
I should, um, get going,
actually, for dinner.

03:30.809 --> 03:34.771
But, um, we should make a plan.
I'll send you a text.

03:34.855 --> 03:38.525
Or we could do that now
since we're both here.

03:38.608 --> 03:41.486
- What?
- Nothing.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.029
Okay.

03:47.951 --> 03:49.703
<i>Nice of Mercer.</i>

03:49.786 --> 03:51.746
I always thought you two
would make a good...

03:51.830 --> 03:54.082
- Mom.
- Couple.

03:56.751 --> 03:58.753
Boy from the neighborhood?

03:58.837 --> 04:00.088
That would've been cute.

04:02.632 --> 04:04.176
Remember when he fixed the roof?

04:04.259 --> 04:06.219
Stop.

04:06.303 --> 04:08.471
- He's not...
- I know, I know.

04:17.772 --> 04:18.772
Mm.

04:20.066 --> 04:21.860
Any word on the insurance?

04:21.943 --> 04:26.948
Oh, they won't cover the cost of IGIV.
It's $40,000.

04:27.032 --> 04:29.492
So, you know, surprise, surprise.
It's not on their list.

04:29.576 --> 04:31.369
Oh, enough of all that.

04:32.787 --> 04:33.788
Come on, honey.

04:35.457 --> 04:37.709
- Help me up.
- Okay.

04:39.794 --> 04:41.421
Here. You got it?

04:41.504 --> 04:42.797
Thanks, Mae.

04:42.881 --> 04:43.881
- Okay?
- Yeah.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.426
That's it.

04:47.886 --> 04:49.721
Well, not so fast.

04:55.602 --> 04:57.687
Okay and turn... just...

04:59.606 --> 05:02.275
- Ready?
- Yeah. I'm good.

05:02.359 --> 05:03.443
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:10.033 --> 05:13.578
- <i>What are you doing right now?</i>
- I'm at work.

05:13.662 --> 05:17.082
I come here each day and in return,
I receive money to buy goods and services.

05:17.165 --> 05:19.005
<i>Ah, well, I've got to be quick.
I'm in Germany.</i>

05:19.084 --> 05:20.770
- Why are you in Germany?
- <i>Regulatory mess.</i>

05:20.794 --> 05:24.297
<i>Those guys did not screw around,
but listen, I got you an interview.</i>

05:24.381 --> 05:26.258
- What?
<i>- I got you an interview tomorrow.</i>

05:26.341 --> 05:29.469
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

05:30.512 --> 05:31.513
Really? No.

05:31.596 --> 05:35.433
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
I did, tomorrow.</i>

05:35.517 --> 05:37.602
Holy shit, Annie, I love you.

05:37.686 --> 05:39.604
<i>Remember,
it's just customer experience.</i>

05:39.688 --> 05:41.666
<i>So answer phones, help people,
what you're already doing</i>

05:41.690 --> 05:42.816
<i>but now a real company.</i>

05:42.899 --> 05:44.276
I know, it's perfect.

05:44.359 --> 05:46.027
<i>Tons of people started there.</i>

05:46.111 --> 05:47.988
I know, I know. Thank you.

05:48.071 --> 05:50.699
<i>Stop saying that.
We're hiring a hundred people this month.</i>

05:50.782 --> 05:53.660
<i>- One of them may as well be you.</i>
- Right, good.

05:53.743 --> 05:56.246
<i>This doesn't mean you're in.
You have to kill the interview.</i>

05:56.329 --> 05:58.331
<i>Know the Circle inside out.
I'm back next week.</i>

05:58.415 --> 06:01.001
<i>By then, you'll be hired
if you kill the interview.</i>

06:01.084 --> 06:02.377
Okay, I will.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.170
<i>You can do it, Mae. Own it!</i>

06:17.392 --> 06:21.396
How would you describe
what the Circle is to say,

06:21.479 --> 06:23.940
- your grandmother?
- Take True You, for example.

06:25.108 --> 06:29.863
It combined everything that was separate
and sloppy into one account.

06:29.946 --> 06:34.576
No more forgetting your password,
multiple identities, identity theft.

06:34.659 --> 06:37.871
You use your real name,
which is tied to your credit card.

06:37.954 --> 06:39.274
I think Grandma's falling asleep.

06:43.126 --> 06:44.127
Okay.

06:47.464 --> 06:50.842
Before True You, it was like
you needed a different vehicle

06:50.925 --> 06:52.719
for every single one of your errands,

06:52.802 --> 06:54.804
and no one should have to own
87 different cars.

06:54.888 --> 06:56.473
It doesn't make sense.

06:56.556 --> 07:00.602
It's the chaos of the Web
made elegant and simple.

07:00.685 --> 07:03.146
Speed round. Paul or John?

07:03.229 --> 07:04.229
Early Paul, late John.

07:04.272 --> 07:07.692
- Mario or Sonic?
- Early Sonic, late Mario.

07:07.776 --> 07:09.486
Introspection or communication?

07:10.945 --> 07:12.655
- Uh...
- Mae.

07:12.739 --> 07:15.366
- Sorry, I'm thinking about it.
- So that's introspection.

07:15.450 --> 07:17.368
- Sushi or Soylent?
- Sushi.

07:17.452 --> 07:18.578
Ever owned a Velcro wallet?

07:19.954 --> 07:21.790
- Yes.
- Velcro shoes?

07:21.873 --> 07:24.417
- Yes.
- Velcro... pants?

07:24.501 --> 07:25.752
Yes.

07:25.835 --> 07:28.596
What was the name of the receptionist
who checked you in this morning?

07:28.630 --> 07:29.631
Um...

07:35.011 --> 07:37.305
- Linda.
- Joan Baez or Joan Crawford?

07:37.389 --> 07:38.848
- Joan Didion.
- "Gif" or "jif"?

07:38.932 --> 07:41.935
I'm not answering that.
There's too much at stake.

07:42.018 --> 07:43.686
Would you like to go out with me?

07:46.773 --> 07:48.316
That's very inappropriate.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.403
Good. Quality or convenience?

07:51.486 --> 07:53.154
Not mutually exclusive.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.323
Needs of the society
or needs of the individual?

07:55.407 --> 07:57.492
- Should be the same.
- You're most scared of?

07:59.911 --> 08:01.621
Unfulfilled potential.

08:18.930 --> 08:22.100
All right, heliport, gym, daycare,

08:22.183 --> 08:24.436
- organic farm, pétanque.
- Pétanque?

08:24.519 --> 08:27.230
- Oh, it's like bocce but French.
- Oh.

08:27.313 --> 08:30.483
Tetherball, lap pool, social pool, doga.

08:34.195 --> 08:38.575
Kennel, nightclub, salon, maker space,

08:38.658 --> 08:42.537
rock climbing, trampoline,
clinic, volleyball.

08:42.620 --> 08:43.913
Was that...? Was that the...?

08:43.997 --> 08:47.083
Content people, news,
arts, film, engineers,

08:47.167 --> 08:50.211
management and me, advertising and you.

08:53.631 --> 08:54.674
All right, let's go.

08:56.176 --> 08:58.094
Your legs are so long.

09:04.267 --> 09:05.101
What?

09:05.185 --> 09:07.437
It's all on sensors.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.314
The elevator reads your ID
and says "hello."

09:09.397 --> 09:13.276
We do that for visitors mostly.
They're usually impressed.

09:13.359 --> 09:14.920
Annie, that's the worst picture
of me ever.

09:14.944 --> 09:17.363
Oh, come on... Oh. Oh, dear.

09:17.447 --> 09:18.948
- Danny!
- What's up?

09:19.032 --> 09:20.384
You remember Dan? I'm handing you off.

09:20.408 --> 09:21.826
- You're all grown-up.
- Oh.

09:21.910 --> 09:25.622
I have the privilege and the honor
to give you your brand new tablet, Mae.

09:25.705 --> 09:27.224
And I sent the password to your phone.

09:27.248 --> 09:29.042
- Oh, my God. It has my name on it.
- Uh-huh.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.294
Oh, this is too sad.
You take care of my little girl.

09:31.377 --> 09:33.213
I will.

09:33.296 --> 09:35.840
If we don't give customers
a human and humane experience,

09:35.924 --> 09:38.259
we have no customers,
it's pretty elemental.

09:38.343 --> 09:39.695
Jared will be doing your training.

09:39.719 --> 09:43.348
I oversee the team,
and Jared oversees the unit.

09:43.431 --> 09:46.142
As you know, you'll be doing
straight-up customer maintenance

09:46.226 --> 09:47.936
for the smaller advertisers.

09:48.019 --> 09:50.021
You work on your portable here.

09:50.104 --> 09:51.814
They send a message
to customer experience,

09:51.898 --> 09:54.317
and it gets routed over to one of you.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.903
Random at first, but once
you start working with a customer,

09:56.986 --> 10:00.114
they'll continue to be routed over to you
for the sake of continuity.

10:00.198 --> 10:02.242
Um, you get the query,
figure out the answer,

10:02.325 --> 10:05.537
you write them back,
and that is the core of it.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.580
Simple enough in theory. So far so good?

10:07.664 --> 10:09.415
- Uh, yeah.
- Cool.

10:09.499 --> 10:12.210
So let's say you've answered
a client's question,

10:12.293 --> 10:13.461
and they seem satisfied.

10:13.545 --> 10:16.106
Now, it's not just that you get a smile
or a frown, though that is part of it.

10:16.130 --> 10:18.591
You get your smile...
it's almost always a smile.

10:18.675 --> 10:21.177
Um, that is when you send the survey.

10:21.261 --> 10:24.681
The survey is a set of quick questions
about, you know, your overall service,

10:24.764 --> 10:27.934
how you did,
and they send that immediately back,

10:28.017 --> 10:31.163
and you get to see how you did right here.
That is the rating. Uh, you know what?

10:31.187 --> 10:32.480
Let's just do a live one.

10:33.648 --> 10:35.191
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

10:35.275 --> 10:37.944
Okay.

10:38.027 --> 10:40.280
Have a nice day.

10:43.449 --> 10:44.951
That's pretty good, 99 is good,

10:45.034 --> 10:49.038
but I can't help wondering
why it wasn't 100. Let's look.

10:50.206 --> 10:51.874
Okay.

10:55.753 --> 10:59.132
Boom. Sometimes you just encounter someone
who isn't really sensitive to the metrics.

10:59.215 --> 11:02.969
So it's important to ask them
and make sure you get that clarity.

11:03.052 --> 11:06.639
And we're back to a perfect score, yeah.

11:06.723 --> 11:08.683
Oh, wow.

11:08.766 --> 11:10.977
All right, are you ready to do this
on your own?

11:11.060 --> 11:12.270
- Yes.
- Awesome.

11:59.359 --> 12:00.902
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry.

12:01.903 --> 12:02.904
Hey, how's it going?

12:02.987 --> 12:04.715
- I thought you were in Amsterdam.
- Oh, just for a day.

12:04.739 --> 12:06.219
Then London, then New York, now here.

12:06.282 --> 12:08.493
- Have you slept?
- A few hours on the plane.

12:08.576 --> 12:10.870
A couple pills, I'm good.
So you? First week.

12:10.953 --> 12:12.997
What?

12:13.081 --> 12:14.165
You got an 87 average.

12:14.248 --> 12:16.542
- That's like a solid B.
- How long till I'm fired?

12:16.626 --> 12:18.645
Listen, when I first started,
it took me a few weeks

12:18.669 --> 12:20.230
to really get the hang of it.
Believe me, okay?

12:20.254 --> 12:22.465
Believe me, you're doing fine.
You're good, all right?

12:22.548 --> 12:23.549
Mm-hm.

12:23.633 --> 12:24.717
Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.

12:27.970 --> 12:29.305
Hey.

12:33.101 --> 12:36.145
Thank you, thank you.
So glad to see you all here.

12:36.229 --> 12:39.732
Now a bunch of you are new
to the company since I last spoke,

12:39.816 --> 12:41.943
so can the guppies all stand up?

12:42.026 --> 12:45.196
- Right, that's you.
- Come on, guppies, just stand up.

12:45.279 --> 12:46.719
- Whoo!
- Guppies, stand up, come on.

12:48.032 --> 12:49.575
Congratulations, nice to have you.

12:49.659 --> 12:54.372
Now "guppies" is just an affectionate term
for you baby fishies.

12:54.455 --> 12:57.291
Soon you will all grow
to become powerful...

12:57.375 --> 12:59.794
- You're adorable.
- I hate you.

12:59.877 --> 13:02.839
The fish that guppies grow up
into being...

13:02.922 --> 13:05.049
What do they grow up into?

13:05.133 --> 13:07.093
Anyway, all right, this is Dream Friday,

13:07.176 --> 13:10.972
the latest in our long tradition
of presenting our newest innovations.

13:11.055 --> 13:14.058
The first Dream Friday
featured Ty Lafitte,

13:14.142 --> 13:16.686
the inventor of True You
and our founding father.

13:16.769 --> 13:20.189
And usually, we feature one
of our engineers or our visionaries

13:20.273 --> 13:22.859
but today unfortunately,
it's just me and for that,

13:22.942 --> 13:24.527
I apologize in advance.

13:24.610 --> 13:26.380
We love you, Eamon!

13:26.404 --> 13:27.572
Thanks, Mom.

13:30.032 --> 13:31.593
Now you might not have seen me
around campus

13:31.617 --> 13:33.178
for the last few days,
and maybe you were wondering

13:33.202 --> 13:34.662
just where the heck I've been.

13:34.745 --> 13:35.872
Surfing!

13:35.955 --> 13:37.707
Argh!

13:37.790 --> 13:41.169
You got me! Yes, I've been surfing.

13:41.252 --> 13:43.588
And that's part
of what I'm here to talk about.

13:43.671 --> 13:46.007
I love to surf and in the past,

13:46.090 --> 13:50.761
I would have to wake up
and call the local surf shop

13:50.845 --> 13:54.015
to ask about the local breaks,
and pretty soon,

13:54.098 --> 13:57.310
the local surf shop
stopped answering their phone.

13:57.393 --> 14:01.564
And then I got a cell phone,

14:01.647 --> 14:04.317
and I could call up my buddies
who were already out

14:04.400 --> 14:06.569
at the beach before me,
and I could ask them,

14:06.652 --> 14:09.989
but they, too,
stopped answering their phones.

14:11.073 --> 14:12.492
And then came...

14:13.534 --> 14:14.535
the Internet.

14:14.619 --> 14:17.538
Whoa. Oh!

14:17.622 --> 14:21.542
Some geniuses set up cameras
on the beaches,

14:21.626 --> 14:25.213
so I could log on
and get some very crude images

14:25.296 --> 14:27.298
of the waves at Stinson Beach.

14:27.381 --> 14:31.093
It was almost worse
than calling the surf shop.

14:31.177 --> 14:32.970
Here's how it used to look.

14:34.555 --> 14:36.724
Almost useless, right?

14:36.807 --> 14:39.018
But now let's refresh that page

14:39.101 --> 14:43.147
and show the site
with our new Circle video delivery.

14:44.315 --> 14:47.193
Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?

14:47.276 --> 14:49.278
Yeah, maybe I should be
out there right now.

14:49.362 --> 14:51.697
But would it surprise you to know

14:51.781 --> 14:56.077
that this is not coming
from some big camera

14:56.160 --> 14:59.247
but actually just one of these?

15:00.623 --> 15:04.252
This camera needs no wires.

15:04.335 --> 15:08.047
It transmits this image via satellite.

15:08.130 --> 15:10.299
I set up that camera this morning.

15:10.383 --> 15:14.178
I stuck it to a tree near the dunes
with no permit, nothing,

15:14.262 --> 15:16.430
in fact, no one even knows it's there.

15:16.514 --> 15:18.432
And actually,
I was pretty busy this morning

15:18.516 --> 15:23.104
because here's Rodeo Beach,
Montera,

15:23.187 --> 15:25.398
Ocean Beach,

15:25.481 --> 15:26.983
Fort Point.

15:27.066 --> 15:28.150
This is my front yard.

15:29.485 --> 15:31.737
And here's my backyard.

15:31.821 --> 15:32.989
Here's traffic on the 101.

15:33.072 --> 15:35.199
Oh, did you think this was just a camera?

15:35.283 --> 15:38.452
No, welcome
to real time analytic processing.

15:38.536 --> 15:42.206
When you see this,
you're also getting this.

15:45.084 --> 15:48.337
Air quality, traffic volume,
weather patterns, biometrics,

15:48.421 --> 15:53.426
facial recognition, saved and searchable,
all to serve you better.

15:53.509 --> 15:58.639
My friends, we are looking
at retailing these in just a few months

15:58.723 --> 16:01.142
for less than a pair of jeans.

16:01.225 --> 16:04.270
And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.

16:04.353 --> 16:07.148
I'm talking about the ones
like I'm wearing.

16:07.231 --> 16:08.274
Wow!

16:08.357 --> 16:13.154
Now, Circlers... do you like to share?

16:13.237 --> 16:14.947
Sharing is caring!

16:15.031 --> 16:17.867
Sharing is caring.
I thought you might say that.

16:17.950 --> 16:19.428
- Sharing is caring?
- Sharing is caring.

16:19.452 --> 16:24.665
I have a dozen helpers all over the world
right now carrying these cameras.

16:24.749 --> 16:27.543
Imagine the human rights implications.

16:27.627 --> 16:31.923
Activists no longer have
to hold up a camera.

16:32.006 --> 16:34.926
Now it's as easy as
gluing a camera to a wall,

16:35.009 --> 16:37.595
and actually, we've done just that.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.431
Do you see any cameras here?

16:41.474 --> 16:42.600
No.

16:42.683 --> 16:48.147
We have 144 cameras in place here,
and it took us just a day to do it,

16:48.230 --> 16:49.565
and they're virtually invisible.

16:49.649 --> 16:53.569
They come in every color,
so camouflaging is a cinch.

16:53.653 --> 16:55.821
This is my favorite. Whoa!

16:55.905 --> 16:58.115
Nice catch.

16:58.199 --> 16:59.492
Sign her up.

16:59.575 --> 17:04.372
So now, the entire world is watching.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.040
You know, I agree with the Hague,

17:06.123 --> 17:08.834
with the human rights activists
all over the world.

17:08.918 --> 17:10.878
There needs to be accountability.

17:10.962 --> 17:14.757
Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.

17:14.840 --> 17:19.804
We will see them. We will hear them.
We will hear and see everything.

17:19.887 --> 17:22.306
If it happens, we'll know.

17:23.933 --> 17:27.603
We're calling it... SeeChange.

17:29.730 --> 17:32.066
SeeChange.

17:34.402 --> 17:36.821
Oh, we'll know the good things, too.

17:36.904 --> 17:39.699
- Aw.
- Aw.

17:39.782 --> 17:42.034
We will see it all.

17:42.118 --> 17:45.246
Because knowing is good.

17:45.329 --> 17:47.832
But knowing everything is better.

17:55.131 --> 17:57.675
Whoo! Yeah!

18:06.559 --> 18:09.395
Good thing you guys like
to keep things modest.

18:09.478 --> 18:10.813
What's this party even for?

18:10.896 --> 18:13.607
SeeChange. Summer solstice.
Everything. Nothing.

18:13.691 --> 18:16.152
Come on, let's be the only ones
who know how to dance!

18:16.235 --> 18:18.696
My God, is that Beck?

18:22.074 --> 18:29.498
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

18:30.666 --> 18:34.545
<i>♪ Come on out of your dreams ♪</i>

18:34.628 --> 18:37.256
<i>♪ And wake up from your rêverie ♪</i>

18:39.091 --> 18:42.803
<i>♪ Time is here, don't go to sleep ♪</i>

18:42.887 --> 18:45.556
<i>♪ Streets are running on the brink ♪</i>

18:46.807 --> 18:49.310
So Bailey, what's he actually like?

18:49.393 --> 18:50.811
You're in the gang of 40.

18:50.895 --> 18:53.206
Yeah, but I don't get a ton
of alone time with him.

18:53.230 --> 18:55.511
I mean, you know,
a lot of people work in the White House.

18:55.566 --> 18:57.818
How many people really get
to know the President?

18:57.902 --> 19:00.946
Oh, actually,
do you wanna see something?

19:01.030 --> 19:03.074
Oh, my God. You need to see this.
Follow me.

19:03.157 --> 19:06.118
<i>♪ Here we are ♪</i>

19:08.245 --> 19:10.873
Here. This is it.

19:15.711 --> 19:17.755
Nice knocker.

19:17.838 --> 19:21.050
Holy shit, right?

19:22.051 --> 19:24.095
Right?

19:24.178 --> 19:27.014
I think all of these have gotta
be first editions?

19:27.098 --> 19:30.017
Oh, but, um, you have to give me a verbal
nondisclosure agreement, okay?

19:30.101 --> 19:31.560
- Annie.
- Seriously.

19:31.644 --> 19:35.397
You shouldn't be here and probably
won't ever be here again, so verbal NDA.

19:37.566 --> 19:40.820
- I promise not to disclose anything.
- Good.

19:40.903 --> 19:43.948
This is where Bailey and Stenton
make all of their plans.

19:44.031 --> 19:48.577
It's very serious.
I mean, this is high nerd, right?

19:48.661 --> 19:50.381
Oh, no, you probably shouldn't play with...

19:52.623 --> 19:56.627
- Like this?
- You're such a dork.

19:56.710 --> 19:57.711
Well...

19:58.838 --> 20:02.383
- So this is where it all happens.
- To be a fly on the wall, right?

20:03.801 --> 20:05.302
We should get back to the party.

20:05.386 --> 20:07.805
Well, you should at least.

20:09.849 --> 20:12.268
- You're not coming back?
- I've got work.

20:12.351 --> 20:14.913
- Annie, it's like, 11 o'clock.
- I've got Australia in a few minutes.

20:14.937 --> 20:17.773
Ah. A-ha. Actually, a few minutes ago,
but you have fun, okay?

20:17.857 --> 20:20.151
- Annie...
- You're gonna have so much fun.

20:24.488 --> 20:26.568
- You guys are gonna love this.
- Okay.

20:29.910 --> 20:30.910
Whoops.

20:42.214 --> 20:45.885
So I heard there's a party around here.

20:45.968 --> 20:48.304
You know, if that's, like...

20:48.387 --> 20:50.097
your kind of thing.

20:50.181 --> 20:51.640
Yeah, maybe I'll check it out.

20:53.726 --> 20:56.446
It's probably not as interesting
as whatever's on your phone, though.

20:59.481 --> 21:00.691
Okay, probably not.

21:06.780 --> 21:10.117
- Do you want a drink?
- I do, but they ran out like an hour ago.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.620
I think they did too, but shh.

21:16.207 --> 21:18.792
Are you serious? Whoa.

21:18.876 --> 21:22.171
- You have glasses in there, too?
- It's my party trick.

21:24.673 --> 21:27.009
- Oh.
- All right.

21:28.219 --> 21:29.219
Thank you.

21:33.849 --> 21:34.849
You're new here.

21:36.227 --> 21:39.480
- You are, right?
- How can you tell that?

21:39.563 --> 21:41.963
- I don't know, I just guessed.
- That's really embarrassing.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.236
I'm sorry.

21:45.319 --> 21:47.196
What do you think?

21:47.279 --> 21:49.198
- Of this?
- Yeah.

21:52.159 --> 21:54.161
I'm excited.

21:54.245 --> 21:55.371
Mm-hm.

21:57.998 --> 22:00.251
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

22:00.334 --> 22:01.853
It's just everyone
that works at the Circle

22:01.877 --> 22:04.838
is so excited to be here,

22:04.922 --> 22:08.801
and they just want to tell everyone
about it all the time. It's, you know...

22:08.884 --> 22:10.386
It's like, "Here, try this Kool-Aid!"

22:10.469 --> 22:12.322
- Oh, Kool-Aid?
- "It's delicious. You'll love it."

22:12.346 --> 22:14.014
- Oh, wow!
- I love Kool-Aid.

22:14.098 --> 22:15.891
Don't you love Kool-Aid?

22:17.101 --> 22:20.312
After my last job
where I just tried to, like,

22:20.396 --> 22:22.636
calm down angry people all day...

22:23.649 --> 22:25.651
I'm just grateful to be here.

22:25.734 --> 22:28.570
I got to go put out a fire.

22:28.654 --> 22:32.199
- Sounds exciting.
- Very. So, uh...

22:32.283 --> 22:33.284
I'll leave you to it.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.205
Have a drink, have a good time,
and stay excited.

22:38.289 --> 22:39.415
You're at the Circle.

22:45.963 --> 22:48.841
Did he tell me his name? I forgot it.

22:50.676 --> 22:54.054
- Have a good night, guppy.
- Oh! Thanks.

22:54.138 --> 22:57.057
<i>Last shuttle
will be leaving in five minutes.</i>

23:24.251 --> 23:28.047
I'm telling you Mae-Mae...
there's something about you.

23:28.130 --> 23:29.923
You have a glow.

23:30.007 --> 23:33.052
- You do.
- I do not have a glow.

23:33.135 --> 23:36.138
Like you're with child.

23:36.221 --> 23:37.973
Ignore him.

23:38.057 --> 23:39.933
So it's been great?

23:40.017 --> 23:42.061
I don't think I ever wanna work
anywhere else.

23:43.062 --> 23:44.938
I told, um, Carolina's mom.

23:45.022 --> 23:47.232
I might've let your salary slip.

23:47.316 --> 23:48.901
- Oh, Mom.
- What?

23:48.984 --> 23:52.988
It's been fun to casually
insert it into conversation.

23:53.072 --> 23:57.076
"My daughter works for the best company
on the planet!

23:57.159 --> 23:59.161
And has full dental."

23:59.244 --> 24:01.538
Please don't. I just got lucky.

24:01.622 --> 24:04.083
- If it wasn't for Annie...
- Annie, how is Annie?

24:05.209 --> 24:06.210
She's good.

24:07.336 --> 24:09.963
- Working too hard.
- What does she do exactly?

24:11.256 --> 24:13.300
She's in the gang of 40.

24:13.383 --> 24:15.385
Uh-huh.

24:15.469 --> 24:17.012
She's in on all the big decisions,

24:18.514 --> 24:20.808
deals with regulatory issues
in other countries.

24:21.934 --> 24:23.769
That sounds important.

24:25.395 --> 24:29.942
Mae, hon, why don't you get your daddy
another beer?

24:30.025 --> 24:31.026
Sure, Dad.

24:46.959 --> 24:48.710
Your hair.

24:48.794 --> 24:50.754
It was a phase.

24:50.838 --> 24:52.548
It was a cute phase.

24:53.799 --> 24:55.551
You good?

24:55.634 --> 24:57.427
I'm good.

24:57.511 --> 24:59.471
You should come visit me at work sometime.

24:59.555 --> 25:00.555
At the Circle?

25:01.473 --> 25:03.183
I'll give that idea a smile.

25:03.267 --> 25:04.726
Hey...

25:04.810 --> 25:07.437
They might think I was there
to clean the toilets.

25:07.521 --> 25:10.274
Come on. They'd love you.

25:10.357 --> 25:12.919
All those tech guys secretly wish
they knew how to use a hand saw,

25:12.943 --> 25:14.820
make something out of wood.

25:14.903 --> 25:16.989
That really sums me up pretty well.

25:17.072 --> 25:20.409
- It could be worse, I guess.
- You know what I mean.

25:20.492 --> 25:22.953
They want you to tell them
about your secret hiking spots.

25:23.036 --> 25:26.540
So they could put them on True You
and ruin it forever?

25:26.623 --> 25:29.376
Ooh, biting commentary.

25:29.459 --> 25:31.420
I mean, come on,
you have to admit, like,

25:31.503 --> 25:34.923
smiles and frowns
used to be for middle school.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.259
Like, "Hey, you know,
do you like stickers and unicorns?"

25:37.342 --> 25:40.179
"Yes, I love stickers and unicorns."
Smile, you know.

25:40.262 --> 25:42.347
And now... now it's everyone.

25:42.431 --> 25:46.310
I can't help it if you're not... social.

25:46.393 --> 25:50.397
I am social enough.
I mean, isn't... this socializing?

25:51.940 --> 25:56.195
I assume you've heard about that senator
that's trying to, like, break you guys up

25:56.278 --> 25:58.906
- citing antitrust laws, right?
- Give me a break, Mercer.

25:58.989 --> 26:01.366
Don't you have to go
and chop some wood or something?

26:06.413 --> 26:07.998
- Thanks, hon.
- Sure, Dad.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.793
His business is doing well.

26:11.877 --> 26:15.297
Mercer? The antler chandeliers?

26:15.380 --> 26:17.758
They are beautiful, Mae.
He's making one for us.

26:17.841 --> 26:21.970
Did I tell you I'm up to an 87 so far?
They say that's pretty good for a guppy.

26:23.388 --> 26:25.140
Who's a guppy?

26:25.224 --> 26:26.934
Well, that's great, Mae.

26:29.645 --> 26:31.897
- Honey?
- Hm?

26:31.980 --> 26:34.816
Oh. Come on,
we'll go in the house, come on.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.777
Dad? Don't worry.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.713
- What happened?
- Please, Mae, let your mother.

26:38.737 --> 26:39.738
Honey, just, just...

26:39.821 --> 26:41.507
Just tell everybody
that Dad's not feeling well,

26:41.531 --> 26:44.409
and they'll understand, really.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

26:44.493 --> 26:46.620
It's okay.

26:46.703 --> 26:48.205
Dad.

26:48.288 --> 26:50.249
Please, Mae.

26:50.332 --> 26:52.626
We got it.

26:53.669 --> 26:54.836
It's okay.

26:56.588 --> 26:57.798
Come on.

27:44.845 --> 27:45.845
Thanks.

27:51.727 --> 27:52.894
See you soon, Mae.

27:54.187 --> 27:55.188
Bye.

28:17.044 --> 28:20.964
<i>Today, I call upon
the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee</i>

28:21.048 --> 28:22.841
<i>to investigate the Circle.</i>

28:22.924 --> 28:27.179
<i>We cannot rely on them to say,
"We're not violating antitrust laws."</i>

28:27.262 --> 28:30.432
<i>I'm sure the Circle
will be glad to cooperate.</i>

28:30.515 --> 28:34.353
<i>We have every confidence
that Senator Williamson's allegations</i>

28:34.436 --> 28:35.437
<i>will be discredited.</i>

28:35.520 --> 28:37.898
You are probably wondering
about your new screen.

28:37.981 --> 28:39.733
Hi, I'm Gina.

28:39.816 --> 28:41.109
- I'm Matt.
- Hi.

28:41.193 --> 28:44.154
Dan said this would be a good moment
to set up all your socials.

28:44.237 --> 28:45.655
- Do you have time?
- Sure.

28:45.739 --> 28:46.740
Great.

28:46.823 --> 28:51.161
I take it last week you were too busy
to set up your company social account,

28:51.244 --> 28:53.580
and I don't think
you've imported your old profile.

28:53.663 --> 28:55.874
Sorry, I've just been
kind of overwhelmed so far.

28:55.957 --> 28:57.751
- Oh.
- No, in a good way.

28:57.834 --> 29:01.671
I just haven't had time yet
for extracurricular stuff.

29:01.755 --> 29:03.173
Wow.

29:03.256 --> 29:05.342
That's so interesting you put it that way.

29:05.425 --> 29:08.387
We actually see your profile
and the activity on it

29:08.470 --> 29:12.557
as integral to your participation here.
This is how your coworkers,

29:12.641 --> 29:16.103
even the ones on the other side of campus,
know who you are.

29:16.186 --> 29:19.523
Communication certainly
isn't extracurricular, right?

29:19.606 --> 29:21.441
Right. Of course.

29:21.525 --> 29:25.904
We consider you a full knowable person
of unlimited potential

29:25.987 --> 29:28.115
and a crucial member of the community.

29:28.198 --> 29:30.826
But you're such an enigma.

29:30.909 --> 29:31.910
I am?

29:31.993 --> 29:35.664
It's been years since someone
so shrouded in mystery started here.

29:35.747 --> 29:38.375
- Everyone really likes you.
- Your work's been exemplary.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.585
Strong ratings for your first week.

29:40.669 --> 29:43.004
Are you satisfied with your performance?

29:43.088 --> 29:45.590
Uh, I think I can do better.

29:45.674 --> 29:48.343
Good, but it's not all about work, okay?

29:48.427 --> 29:51.388
- It's all also about community.
- Of course.

29:51.471 --> 29:53.890
It's all connected.

29:54.891 --> 29:58.645
But you've had a blip or two when it comes
to meshing with the community,

29:58.729 --> 30:02.107
like your absence at several weekend
or evening events.

30:02.190 --> 30:04.526
Which are, of course, optional.

30:04.609 --> 30:06.629
- I'm sorry?
- Let's start with this weekend.

30:06.653 --> 30:12.951
You left campus at 11:42 p.m. on Friday
and got back 8:46 a.m., Monday.

30:13.034 --> 30:14.536
Was there work on the weekend?

30:14.619 --> 30:16.163
- Oh, no, no!
- I didn't... I'm sorry.

30:16.246 --> 30:17.080
Oh, so sweet.

30:17.164 --> 30:18.844
There wasn't mandatory work
on the weekend.

30:18.915 --> 30:22.502
This isn't like a clock in,
clock out type place, thank God!

30:22.586 --> 30:24.397
But, you know,
there were thousands of people here

30:24.421 --> 30:26.301
participating in a hundred
different activities.

30:26.339 --> 30:27.339
So many.

30:29.426 --> 30:31.511
I'm sorry, I, um...

30:31.595 --> 30:35.557
My dad had an... an episode,
and I was home helping out with that.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.310
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is that related to his MS?

30:40.020 --> 30:42.731
Uh... yeah.

30:42.814 --> 30:44.566
We didn't know anything
about this incident.

30:44.649 --> 30:46.943
Did you reach out to any Circlers
during this crisis?

30:47.027 --> 30:51.239
- Annie? Anybody?
- Uh, no. I... No.

30:51.323 --> 30:55.368
Mae, there are four groups here
for staffers dealing with MS,

30:55.452 --> 30:57.537
two of them for children of MS patients.

30:57.621 --> 30:59.873
Have you sought out a group?

30:59.956 --> 31:02.501
- I didn't know.
- Okay.

31:02.584 --> 31:06.671
Can you... talk about what you did
the rest of the weekend?

31:06.755 --> 31:09.341
Nothing, really. I just... I kayaked.

31:09.424 --> 31:12.594
You kayaked? With who?

31:12.677 --> 31:15.263
Nobody. Just on my own.

31:15.347 --> 31:16.848
I kayak.

31:16.932 --> 31:18.159
We could have kayaked together.

31:18.183 --> 31:23.230
Nothing on your profile about kayaking,
no smiles, no ratings, no posts.

31:23.313 --> 31:27.734
I'm no psychologist, but this behavior
sometimes stems from low self-worth.

31:27.818 --> 31:32.322
This is what participation is all about,
bringing you, lifting you up.

31:32.405 --> 31:35.659
Thus, your participation window.

31:35.742 --> 31:39.246
I can't believe you've been here this long
without being on the main social feed.

31:39.329 --> 31:41.456
You're about to have your world rocked.

31:42.541 --> 31:44.501
See, these are all
of last week's messages.

31:44.584 --> 31:46.211
That's why there's so many.

31:46.294 --> 31:49.297
- Eight thousand?
- Mm-hm.

31:49.381 --> 31:52.801
Looks like you have a lot
of catching up to do here. A feast!

31:52.884 --> 31:54.427
Have fun.

31:55.929 --> 31:57.764
Oh, forgot one more thing.

31:57.848 --> 32:01.685
This is your participation rank.
Party rank for short.

32:01.768 --> 32:05.814
Some people here call it the
popularity rank, but it's not really that.

32:05.897 --> 32:07.816
It's just an algorithm-generated number

32:07.899 --> 32:10.819
that takes into account
all your activity in the inner circle.

32:10.902 --> 32:11.902
That makes sense?

32:12.821 --> 32:16.366
- I think so.
- Okay. And again, it's just for fun.

32:16.449 --> 32:18.410
- It's just for fun!
- Okay, bye.

32:21.705 --> 32:24.124
Um, I think
it's for Tuesday next week?

32:24.207 --> 32:25.876
Is that in Building 74 or...?

32:25.959 --> 32:28.199
- Uh, no. It's actually off campus.
- Okay.

33:08.543 --> 33:09.543
<i>It's been a month.</i>

33:09.586 --> 33:12.339
<i>When are you coming home?
We miss you.</i>

33:12.422 --> 33:14.132
I can't. You know.

33:14.215 --> 33:17.093
<i>How's the dorm?
Do you have to clean your own room?</i>

33:17.177 --> 33:19.471
- We have people that do that.
- <i>Ooh, thank God.</i>

33:19.554 --> 33:21.640
How's Dad?

33:21.723 --> 33:24.684
<i>He's okay. He... he fell yesterday.</i>

33:24.768 --> 33:28.271
<i>And I couldn't lift him up,
but thank God Mercer came by.</i>

33:28.355 --> 33:29.564
<i>He's stronger than I thought.</i>

33:31.274 --> 33:32.275
I'm sorry.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.486
I should have been there.

33:42.953 --> 33:44.037
Is that one of his?

33:45.038 --> 33:48.875
<i>- Yeah. I think it's his best work.</i>
- It's awesome.

33:51.211 --> 33:54.506
I gotta go, Mom. I love you.

33:54.589 --> 33:56.675
<i>- Okay, well, bye. Bye.</i>
- Bye.

34:12.649 --> 34:16.277
I'm so sorry about last week.
I've been up my own ass.

34:16.361 --> 34:18.214
And I didn't mean
to be a shitty friend.

34:18.238 --> 34:20.699
It's okay. Where are we going?

34:20.782 --> 34:23.243
Listen, I've been looking
into your parents' situation,

34:23.326 --> 34:26.287
and I think... I have an idea.

34:26.371 --> 34:28.206
All right? Yeah?

34:28.289 --> 34:29.457
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:29.541 --> 34:33.336
- This is Jessica. This is Mae.
- Hello, Mae, how are you?

34:33.420 --> 34:35.964
I understand you haven't done
your medical intake yet.

34:36.047 --> 34:38.299
- No.
- Can you drink this for me?

34:43.471 --> 34:44.764
All of it, if you can.

34:49.602 --> 34:53.398
- I told you about Mae's dad's...
- Mm-hm, multiple sclerosis.

34:53.481 --> 34:56.526
I did my post doc on MS.
Love to get some real time data.

34:57.819 --> 34:58.862
Here you go.

34:59.904 --> 35:00.904
Okay.

35:02.574 --> 35:04.868
- How does this feel?
- Warm.

35:06.828 --> 35:09.247
Is this for free?

35:09.330 --> 35:11.166
Of course. You get to keep it.

35:11.249 --> 35:13.084
So, it's going to feel warm
for a few days,

35:13.168 --> 35:15.462
then you and the media band
will get used to each other,

35:15.545 --> 35:18.548
but it has to touch the skin to work.

35:18.631 --> 35:21.301
Waterproof. No need to take it off.

35:21.384 --> 35:23.011
Let's activate it, shall we?

35:24.888 --> 35:25.722
Is that the...?

35:25.805 --> 35:29.225
Well, it's syncing up with the sensor
you ingested a second ago.

35:32.645 --> 35:34.397
And now...

35:34.481 --> 35:36.721
Let's have you walk around the room.

35:40.987 --> 35:41.987
Briskly.

35:43.782 --> 35:47.118
It'll collect data on your heart rate,
blood pressure, cholesterol,

35:47.202 --> 35:52.916
sleep duration, sleep quality,
digestive efficiency, on and on.

35:52.999 --> 35:55.794
And all that data is stored
in the Cloud and in your tablet,

35:55.877 --> 35:59.380
anywhere you want, and of course, it's all
collated with the rest of the Circle.

36:00.548 --> 36:02.068
You'd be amazed at the patterns we see

36:02.092 --> 36:04.719
and the problems we can avoid
when we have all that data.

36:04.803 --> 36:07.163
Speaking of which, I was thinking
it would make sense for...

36:07.222 --> 36:09.933
Mae's folks to come
on the Circle health plan.

36:10.016 --> 36:11.643
Uh, wait, what?

36:11.726 --> 36:14.205
Wouldn't be the first time,
and I'd really like to get

36:14.229 --> 36:15.438
real time data from your dad.

36:15.522 --> 36:16.856
Sit back down.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.650
Can you get in touch with HR,

36:18.733 --> 36:19.877
- clear it with them?
- Yep.

36:19.901 --> 36:21.611
- Tell them I say it's a go.
- Absolutely.

36:23.446 --> 36:25.865
We'll send someone out
to set them up, okay?

36:27.992 --> 36:30.078
<i>Honey, this is gonna
save our lives.</i>

36:30.161 --> 36:33.748
<i>- Thank you. And thank Annie too.</i>
- They thank you.

36:33.832 --> 36:35.333
Aw.

36:35.416 --> 36:37.836
<i>This is amazing. Call you later, okay?</i>

36:37.919 --> 36:40.755
Okay. I gotta go.
Big event here on campus.

36:40.839 --> 36:42.006
<i>- Exciting.</i>
- I know.

36:42.090 --> 36:43.883
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

36:43.967 --> 36:46.344
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye.

36:47.804 --> 36:51.391
- Thank you.
- Oh. You're welcome.

36:53.309 --> 36:55.478
All right. You okay?

36:55.562 --> 36:57.772
Okay. Come on.

37:04.988 --> 37:09.367
Openness is something
we advocate here at the Circle.

37:10.410 --> 37:11.411
We live it.

37:11.494 --> 37:15.248
We demonstrate our commitment
to openness every day.

37:16.833 --> 37:20.003
Our government, not so much.

37:20.086 --> 37:23.882
We expect openness,
and we get obfuscation.

37:23.965 --> 37:25.758
We get doublespeak.

37:25.842 --> 37:31.306
No wonder Congress' approval rating
is currently at 11 percent.

37:32.974 --> 37:36.102
Now, I'm sure a lot of you
have heard about a certain senator

37:36.186 --> 37:42.275
who it was revealed has been involved
in some... very unsavory business.

37:43.318 --> 37:47.697
What are we to learn from this?
We need accountability.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.866
We need openness.

37:49.949 --> 37:53.536
We need to know
what the people who represent us

37:53.620 --> 37:57.248
are doing with their time on our dime.

37:59.459 --> 38:01.169
To serve us better.

38:01.252 --> 38:02.837
Well, I'm happy to report

38:02.921 --> 38:08.134
that there's a woman
who is taking all of this very seriously

38:08.218 --> 38:13.223
and is taking some pretty dramatic steps
to address the problem.

38:13.306 --> 38:16.226
So please join me in welcoming

38:16.309 --> 38:19.979
Olivia Santos,
Congresswoman for District 14.

38:24.442 --> 38:25.522
That's right, Tom.

38:26.527 --> 38:30.531
I am as concerned as you are
about the need for citizens to know

38:30.615 --> 38:33.618
what their elected leaders are doing.

38:33.701 --> 38:39.749
So I intend to show exactly
how democracy can and should be.

38:44.712 --> 38:48.091
Starting today, my every meeting,

38:48.174 --> 38:52.887
my every phone call
and e-mail will be accessible

38:52.971 --> 38:56.641
to my constituents and to the world.

38:59.978 --> 39:02.355
In real time!

39:02.438 --> 39:08.069
It will all be on my True You page.
That's right. Thank you, thank you.

39:08.152 --> 39:11.406
Goodbye, backroom deals.
Goodbye, shady lobbyists.

39:11.489 --> 39:15.994
Hello, democracy. Open and accountable!

39:16.077 --> 39:17.662
That's right. That's a fact!

39:19.372 --> 39:22.709
- Where do you work?
- I work in customer experience.

39:22.792 --> 39:26.004
I started in CE, too. A lot of us did.

39:26.087 --> 39:28.006
Cool. Where do you work now?

39:28.089 --> 39:30.925
Biometrics, iris scanning,
facial recognition.

39:31.009 --> 39:33.678
Right now, I'm working on Child Track.

39:33.761 --> 39:36.681
The program protects children
from predators.

39:36.764 --> 39:39.642
The second a kid isn't where
they're supposed to be, an alert goes off

39:39.726 --> 39:42.228
and the kid can be tracked down
within 90 seconds.

39:42.312 --> 39:46.524
- Wow. Do they wear a bracelet or...?
- We place chips in the bone.

39:50.862 --> 39:51.863
Uh, you're...

39:54.365 --> 39:55.783
You're serious?

39:55.867 --> 40:00.038
I'm serious about immediately reducing
kidnapping, rape, and murder

40:00.121 --> 40:01.622
by 99 percent.

40:05.043 --> 40:06.312
I think I'm going to get a drink.

40:06.336 --> 40:07.795
- But...
- Oh.

40:07.879 --> 40:10.340
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

40:16.763 --> 40:18.556
- Hey.
- Hey, check your e-mail

40:18.639 --> 40:22.101
- 'cause I sent you an invite.
- Awesome. Thank you. All right.

40:22.185 --> 40:24.228
- Yeah, good to see you.
- You too.

40:24.312 --> 40:25.980
- Hi, Mae! How's it going?
- Hey.

40:26.064 --> 40:27.648
- You having fun?
- Yeah, you?

40:27.732 --> 40:28.733
Yeah.

41:01.641 --> 41:03.476
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:07.897 --> 41:10.400
So, what did you think
about the whole presentation?

41:10.483 --> 41:12.110
- The Santos thing?
- Yeah.

41:14.112 --> 41:17.240
It's exciting. It's a...

41:17.323 --> 41:21.035
- Momentous moment in the history of...
- Okay, what did you really think?

41:26.249 --> 41:28.376
I thought it was a bit much.

41:28.459 --> 41:29.979
Just a little bit.

41:32.046 --> 41:33.548
So where does all the data go?

41:33.631 --> 41:36.968
Is it stored somewhere? In the Cloud?

41:38.010 --> 41:39.470
There's a physical place, too.

41:43.141 --> 41:44.434
Do you wanna see something?

42:06.622 --> 42:10.543
So you're gonna have to leave
your stuff outside before you go in.

42:10.626 --> 42:13.004
Just because you're not
supposed to... you know.

42:18.426 --> 42:23.431
So I'm just going to have to take... this.
And this.

42:36.110 --> 42:37.254
I want to thank you already for this.

42:37.278 --> 42:40.364
I love following strangers
down dark corridors.

42:40.448 --> 42:43.743
- This is the best.
- Almost there.

42:50.041 --> 42:54.670
This holds Congresswoman Santos,
every second of her from now on.

42:56.255 --> 42:58.090
And this will be the next one.

42:59.967 --> 43:02.887
- Just these?
- Oh, no. There's more.

43:06.599 --> 43:07.725
What is this?

43:07.808 --> 43:11.062
Well, it was supposed to be a part
of a subway but they abandoned it.

43:12.438 --> 43:14.899
- Where does it go?
- It connects to the bay.

43:14.982 --> 43:19.070
But I've traveled about a half a mile
into it, gets too wet.

43:22.990 --> 43:24.951
And that's where the rest of it will be.

43:26.244 --> 43:28.996
- The rest of what?
- The rest of it all.

43:30.456 --> 43:32.542
Santos is just the start.

43:33.668 --> 43:36.921
The plan is everything recorded,
seen, broadcast,

43:37.004 --> 43:41.008
all of it stored, analyzed,
available to the Circle in any way.

43:42.635 --> 43:43.995
You did your health intake, right?

43:45.263 --> 43:46.847
- Yeah.
- See, right? Look.

43:46.931 --> 43:50.309
Every step, every breath,
all of it stored.

43:51.978 --> 43:53.688
They can use it however they see fit.

43:53.771 --> 43:55.314
We're being studied.

43:55.398 --> 43:58.943
Everyone's data in the Circle
is being studied, monetized.

43:59.026 --> 44:00.486
It is voluntary.

44:01.654 --> 44:04.949
And isn't that the whole point?
Having everything in one place?

44:06.617 --> 44:08.703
I mean, that's True You.

44:08.786 --> 44:12.415
That's not why I invented True You.
Not even close.

44:12.498 --> 44:14.250
Ty Lafitte invented True You.

44:15.793 --> 44:17.420
Yeah.

44:17.503 --> 44:18.503
I'm Ty.

44:20.506 --> 44:21.716
No, you're not.

44:21.799 --> 44:24.468
Ty Lafitte has been off the grid
for years.

44:27.096 --> 44:30.099
Oh, my God.

44:30.182 --> 44:31.182
I'm Ty.

44:32.018 --> 44:33.936
Why the low profile?

44:34.020 --> 44:36.814
I just wanted to move through
this world like a normal person.

44:36.897 --> 44:39.400
I didn't wanna be watched every second.

44:39.483 --> 44:41.652
But I do spend a lot of time here.

44:41.736 --> 44:44.864
It's easier. I don't have to deal
with Stenton and Bailey.

44:44.947 --> 44:49.201
Not that I'm privy to their conversations
in their little sanctum.

44:49.285 --> 44:53.664
Holy shit. I'm in a cave with Ty Lafitte.

44:53.748 --> 44:59.879
Wait, hold on. So when we met,
you didn't know who I was?

44:59.962 --> 45:02.715
You never told me your name.

45:02.798 --> 45:04.842
And after a while,
it was just weird to ask.

45:06.636 --> 45:10.973
I knew I could trust you when I met you.
I don't know, I just thought to myself,

45:11.057 --> 45:13.217
this girl, she doesn't have
a cynical bone in her body.

45:14.226 --> 45:15.936
Reminds me of how I used to be.

45:16.937 --> 45:19.607
Listen, you can't tell anyone
that you were here.

45:19.690 --> 45:20.890
Okay? That I brought you here.

45:21.942 --> 45:22.943
Okay.

45:23.027 --> 45:27.365
Things at the Circle,
they need to change.

45:27.448 --> 45:29.658
Like what? Connecting the world?

45:30.951 --> 45:32.787
Insuring my parents?

45:32.870 --> 45:35.456
You should be really proud
of what you created.

45:35.539 --> 45:37.541
Look, proud? Proud of what?

45:37.625 --> 45:40.836
The disregard for privacy,
the use of personal data

45:40.920 --> 45:43.381
for the accumulation of wealth
and control?

45:43.464 --> 45:45.383
I'm not proud.
This is not what I created.

45:45.466 --> 45:47.426
Do you think Senator Williamson
being investigated

45:47.468 --> 45:49.553
by the FBI is just a coincidence?

45:49.637 --> 45:51.531
We can't be seen together,
and you have to promise me.

45:51.555 --> 45:53.315
You can't tell anyone
that we were down here.

46:07.613 --> 46:08.697
Hello?

46:08.781 --> 46:10.950
<i>Mae, you have a visitor here
to see you.</i>

46:11.033 --> 46:12.201
In the lobby?

46:18.290 --> 46:20.042
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:20.126 --> 46:23.170
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm really not okay.

46:24.255 --> 46:26.424
Why didn't you call, send a text?

46:26.507 --> 46:29.969
Because I wanted to see you in person.
I wanted to look you in the eyes.

46:31.512 --> 46:32.596
Okay.

46:32.680 --> 46:38.436
- Um, I'll sign you in.
- No, just wait, I...

46:38.519 --> 46:42.189
- The stuff you posted about my work.
- Your chandeliers?

46:42.273 --> 46:45.443
Yeah.
I know you meant well, but...

46:45.526 --> 46:47.945
What's the problem?
I thought I saw good stuff going up.

46:48.028 --> 46:49.947
They started calling me a deer killer.

46:50.948 --> 46:53.701
And then there's a campaign
to shut me down.

46:53.784 --> 46:56.203
I wasn't even online. I was working.

46:56.287 --> 46:59.081
And when I checked my e-mail,
there were death threats.

47:03.169 --> 47:04.211
I'm sorry.

47:04.295 --> 47:05.629
Death threats, Mae.

47:05.713 --> 47:07.548
Obviously, I never meant
for this to happen.

47:07.631 --> 47:09.925
But I... I can fix it.

47:14.305 --> 47:17.098
Mae.

47:18.434 --> 47:19.518
Will you listen to me?

47:20.811 --> 47:21.687
I can't do this.

47:21.770 --> 47:25.232
I can't be a part of this world
that you're creating.

47:25.316 --> 47:26.442
What are you talking about?

47:26.525 --> 47:28.611
Jesus Christ, look at these people!

47:28.694 --> 47:30.321
Does this really seem okay to you?

47:30.404 --> 47:32.132
Why don't you go
kill some more deer, Mercer?

47:32.156 --> 47:35.159
I never killed any deer.
I don't kill deer.

47:35.242 --> 47:38.704
Mercer, look, let's not do this here.

47:38.787 --> 47:40.331
Let's go upstairs.

47:40.414 --> 47:42.791
- I'll figure it out.
- Do you ever leave this place, Mae?

47:44.376 --> 47:48.130
We used to go on adventures
and have fun and see things,

47:48.214 --> 47:50.674
and you were brave and excited.

47:52.510 --> 47:54.803
And now it's all filtered through this.

48:01.268 --> 48:02.478
Bye.

51:08.956 --> 51:10.457
I can't believe I was so stupid.

51:12.459 --> 51:14.145
I'm so lucky that you guys
were around here.

51:14.169 --> 51:15.838
Luck? Hell.

51:15.921 --> 51:18.340
SeeChange cameras saved your life.

51:18.424 --> 51:19.883
A cop saw you go through the fence,

51:19.967 --> 51:22.344
and then we got a call
from someone watching the seals.

51:28.809 --> 51:30.394
So, Mae, how do you feel?

51:34.356 --> 51:35.356
Ashamed.

51:35.399 --> 51:38.110
I... I barely slept.

51:38.193 --> 51:40.821
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.
We all are.

51:41.864 --> 51:44.366
And everyone
who watched your adventure online.

51:44.450 --> 51:46.869
I hope your folks weren't too worried.

51:46.952 --> 51:47.995
They're doing okay.

51:49.580 --> 51:51.707
I understand
your father's condition has improved.

51:53.041 --> 51:54.293
Very much.

51:58.630 --> 51:59.631
Mr. Bailey...

52:00.632 --> 52:03.135
I want to say how much
I value my position here...

52:05.137 --> 52:06.805
and what you've done for my family.

52:06.889 --> 52:10.476
Mae, you're a valued part of the Circle,
and you're family.

52:10.559 --> 52:13.020
And we care about
everybody you care about.

52:14.188 --> 52:17.775
You know, this incident
has actually shown a lot of people

52:17.858 --> 52:19.067
the necessity for SeeChange.

52:20.611 --> 52:22.988
I'm so glad those cameras were there.

52:23.071 --> 52:24.549
I wish you would've known
there was a camera there

52:24.573 --> 52:26.825
before you swiped that kayak,
but...

52:29.453 --> 52:32.748
Mae, Tom and I want to talk you
about an idea, but before we do,

52:34.792 --> 52:36.502
is there anything you want to tell us?

52:41.173 --> 52:43.383
That I've been here before?

52:43.467 --> 52:46.553
It's only our lies that get us in trouble,
the things we hide.

52:48.138 --> 52:50.557
Of course I know you've
been in here before.

52:52.559 --> 52:55.312
And now that I know your secret,
do you feel better or worse?

53:00.025 --> 53:01.902
Better.

53:01.985 --> 53:03.111
Relieved, actually.

53:04.947 --> 53:08.408
I am a believer
in the perfectibility of human beings.

53:08.492 --> 53:12.120
When we are our best selves,
the possibilities are endless.

53:12.204 --> 53:14.248
There isn't a problem
that we cannot solve.

53:14.331 --> 53:18.085
We can cure any disease
and we can end hunger, and...

53:19.795 --> 53:24.383
Without secrets, without the hoarding
of knowledge and information,

53:24.466 --> 53:27.261
we can finally realize our potential.

53:30.305 --> 53:32.558
This is a special Dream Friday.

53:32.641 --> 53:37.855
I thought I'd change it up a bit today
and not have a speech but an interview.

53:38.981 --> 53:41.358
I had a conversation
with a young Circler the other day

53:41.441 --> 53:42.943
that I wanted to share with you.

53:43.944 --> 53:47.281
I've asked Mae Holland,
who some of you might know

53:47.364 --> 53:50.868
as one of our new guppies in customer
experience, to join me today.

53:50.951 --> 53:55.122
Mae's only been with us for a few months
but she has made quite an impression.

53:55.205 --> 53:57.541
Let's bring her out. Mae Holland!

54:08.010 --> 54:09.887
Well, hi, Mae, how are you?

54:09.970 --> 54:10.971
- Terrified.
- Mm.

54:11.054 --> 54:12.514
Don't be nervous.

54:12.598 --> 54:14.558
Easy for you to say.

54:15.851 --> 54:17.477
All right, Mae, we have all seen

54:17.561 --> 54:19.271
the SeeChange footage
from the other night,

54:19.354 --> 54:21.565
but please describe
what happened for us.

54:23.233 --> 54:24.568
I committed a crime.

54:25.819 --> 54:29.323
I borrowed a kayak
without the owner's knowledge,

54:29.406 --> 54:30.886
paddled out to the middle of the bay,

54:32.284 --> 54:34.953
and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.

54:35.037 --> 54:39.374
Well, I'm not sure
that's exactly a capital offense,

54:39.458 --> 54:41.585
but you did risk your own life.

54:42.836 --> 54:45.172
So, Mae, do you think
you behave better or worse

54:45.255 --> 54:48.091
- when you are being watched?
- Better.

54:49.676 --> 54:51.219
Without a doubt.

54:51.303 --> 54:54.056
And what happens when you're alone
and unobserved?

54:55.140 --> 54:57.017
Well, for starters, I steal kayaks.

54:58.602 --> 55:00.854
Jesus. She's a natural.

55:00.938 --> 55:05.067
Seriously. I do things I don't wanna do.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.694
I lie.

55:07.778 --> 55:09.714
When we spoke the other day,
you had a way of putting it

55:09.738 --> 55:11.382
that I thought
was very interesting and succinct.

55:11.406 --> 55:13.116
Could you tell us all what you said?

55:14.993 --> 55:17.120
I said that secrets are lies.

55:18.330 --> 55:19.706
Secrets are lies.

55:21.667 --> 55:22.667
Go on.

55:23.835 --> 55:29.091
Secrets are what make crimes possible.

55:29.174 --> 55:31.969
We behave worse
when we're not accountable.

55:33.387 --> 55:35.764
I was my worst self

55:35.847 --> 55:38.433
because I didn't think
anyone was watching.

55:40.060 --> 55:41.060
I thought...

55:42.646 --> 55:43.647
that I was alone.

55:44.773 --> 55:48.527
So, what did you see
on this kayaking trip, Mae?

55:48.610 --> 55:50.821
- Was it beautiful?
- It was.

55:51.989 --> 55:53.699
There was almost a full moon.

55:54.825 --> 55:56.076
And it felt like...

55:58.120 --> 56:01.540
it felt like I was paddling
through liquid silver.

56:01.623 --> 56:04.126
Hmm, sounds incredible.

56:05.210 --> 56:07.295
But there's no record of any of it.

56:07.379 --> 56:09.381
- Not outside my own memory.
- Hmm.

56:12.467 --> 56:13.844
Okay.

56:13.927 --> 56:16.388
So now here we get
into something personal.

56:16.471 --> 56:20.600
As you know, I have a son, Gunner,

56:21.685 --> 56:24.062
who was born with cerebral palsy.

56:24.146 --> 56:26.231
And though he's living a very full life

56:26.314 --> 56:29.276
and we're always trying
to improve his opportunities,

56:29.359 --> 56:32.404
he is confined to a wheelchair.

56:32.487 --> 56:35.490
He can't walk.

56:35.574 --> 56:37.492
He can't run.

56:37.576 --> 56:39.745
He can't go kayaking.

56:40.954 --> 56:44.499
So, what does he do if he wants
to experience something like that?

56:44.583 --> 56:46.585
Well, he watches video.

56:46.668 --> 56:48.128
He looks at pictures.

56:49.337 --> 56:53.467
And much of his experiences of the world
come through the experience of others.

56:53.550 --> 56:57.179
When he experiences the view
of a Circler climbing Mount Kenya,

56:57.262 --> 56:59.389
he feels like he's climbed Mount Kenya.

57:01.600 --> 57:05.062
When he sees firsthand video
from an America's Cup crew member,

57:05.145 --> 57:10.233
he feels in some way that he's sailed
in the America's Cup too.

57:10.317 --> 57:13.695
And these experiences
were facilitated by generous humans

57:13.779 --> 57:16.865
who shared what they saw with the world,
my son included,

57:16.948 --> 57:19.388
and there are many others out there
that are just like Gunner.

57:19.451 --> 57:22.079
Now does it feel right
to have deprived them

57:22.162 --> 57:23.872
of seeing what you saw, Mae?

57:27.542 --> 57:28.543
It doesn't.

57:31.713 --> 57:32.881
It feels very wrong.

57:35.842 --> 57:36.968
It was selfish.

57:38.845 --> 57:44.184
When you deprive others of experiences
like the ones I had,

57:47.062 --> 57:49.064
you're essentially stealing from them.

57:50.107 --> 57:54.528
Knowledge is a basic human right.

57:56.988 --> 58:03.370
Access to all possible human experience
is a basic human right.

58:16.758 --> 58:20.303
Thank you, Mae, for your candor
and your consummate humanity.

58:20.387 --> 58:22.472
Now... now the best part.

58:22.556 --> 58:25.183
In the interest of sharing
everything she can with the world,

58:25.267 --> 58:27.978
Mae has, uh... Mae has some news.

58:31.606 --> 58:32.774
From now on...

58:34.693 --> 58:41.408
I'll be wearing a modified
SeeChange camera at all times.

58:43.910 --> 58:46.121
I'm going fully transparent.

58:49.124 --> 58:51.168
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.

58:53.211 --> 58:56.715
I'll be starting immediately.

58:56.798 --> 58:57.798
That's right.

58:59.593 --> 59:03.180
Mae will be the first Circler
to share every single second

59:03.263 --> 59:06.391
of her work
and her personal life with the public,

59:06.475 --> 59:08.768
so let's give her an even bigger hand!

59:18.820 --> 59:20.071
I'm proud of you.

59:25.702 --> 59:29.873
Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae!

59:48.517 --> 59:49.869
<i>Hello.</i>

59:49.893 --> 59:51.853
Good morning, everyone.

59:51.937 --> 59:55.148
<i>The sun is shining,
and I definitely need my coffee.</i>

59:56.358 --> 59:59.319
We are in my third week of transparency,

59:59.402 --> 1:00:01.488
and we're up to...

1:00:01.571 --> 1:00:05.659
2,308,007 viewers.

1:00:05.742 --> 1:00:06.576
<i>Wow.</i>

1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:08.828
Did I tell you guys
I'm not a morning person?

1:00:09.996 --> 1:00:13.708
Okay, among all of those viewers...

1:00:14.834 --> 1:00:15.834
are...

1:00:16.670 --> 1:00:19.047
- <i>I don't even know what...</i>
- Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.

1:00:19.130 --> 1:00:20.966
<i>- Hi!
- Hi, Mae.</i>

1:00:21.049 --> 1:00:22.551
Say hello to everyone.

1:00:22.634 --> 1:00:24.678
<i>Hello, Circle.</i>

1:00:24.761 --> 1:00:27.264
Look. We match.

1:00:27.347 --> 1:00:28.932
<i>- Yeah.
- We sure do.</i>

1:00:29.015 --> 1:00:31.476
<i>- These are great.
- Very stylish.</i>

1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:33.728
I love you guys. I'll see you later.

1:00:33.812 --> 1:00:36.106
<i>- Love you. Bye.
- Love you too, sweetheart.</i>

1:00:41.528 --> 1:00:45.323
- Hello, Circlers.
<i>- Hi, Mae.</i>

1:00:45.407 --> 1:00:48.410
So this is where I worked
when I first arrived at the Circle,

1:00:48.493 --> 1:00:51.871
and this is where I still work
at the Circle.

1:00:51.955 --> 1:00:54.666
Because even though I have you guys
looking over my shoulder...

1:00:54.749 --> 1:00:58.044
I'm still basically a guppy.

1:00:58.128 --> 1:01:02.882
- Go! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

1:01:02.966 --> 1:01:05.844
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1:01:05.927 --> 1:01:08.087
<i>What are you doing?
Tell your own stories, sheep.</i>

1:01:08.138 --> 1:01:10.515
<i>Stop looking at us, sheep!</i>

1:01:10.599 --> 1:01:12.225
<i>All right, that's our scene.</i>

1:01:12.309 --> 1:01:15.061
Whoo!

1:01:15.145 --> 1:01:19.566
Sorry about that. Okay, so, next up,
we just need the name of a person

1:01:19.649 --> 1:01:23.486
who is historically significant.

1:01:23.570 --> 1:01:26.656
- Mae Holland!
- Oh, my God!

1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:28.241
<i>Sorry, we don't know who that is.</i>

1:01:28.325 --> 1:01:31.703
She's nobody, trust me.

1:01:33.955 --> 1:01:35.624
Home sweet home.

1:01:35.707 --> 1:01:37.959
Speaking of which,
let's check in with the folks.

1:01:40.295 --> 1:01:42.547
Hey, where are you guys?

1:01:47.427 --> 1:01:48.428
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:01:48.511 --> 1:01:51.431
<i>- Yeah. There you go.</i>
- Whoa! Ah!

1:01:51.514 --> 1:01:52.891
Um...

1:01:52.974 --> 1:01:55.185
Uh, I hope the engineers are watching,

1:01:55.268 --> 1:01:57.549
because that definitely
shouldn't have happened

1:01:57.604 --> 1:02:00.940
And, um, it definitely
won't happen again.

1:02:01.024 --> 1:02:02.710
You can trust me there.

1:02:13.244 --> 1:02:15.622
<i>This is me brushing my teeth.</i>

1:02:15.705 --> 1:02:17.791
<i>If you're enjoying this,
I'm worried about you.</i>

1:02:34.265 --> 1:02:35.725
Good night, everyone.

1:02:36.935 --> 1:02:39.479
I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day,

1:02:39.562 --> 1:02:42.649
but I'm happy I had you with me,
each and every one of you.

1:03:32.699 --> 1:03:34.200
<i>Never a boring day here.</i>

1:03:35.368 --> 1:03:38.496
A lot of you guys have been asking me
about this sculpture,

1:03:38.580 --> 1:03:39.873
which is a treat for me.

1:03:39.956 --> 1:03:42.667
I finally get to use
my art history degree.

1:03:42.751 --> 1:03:45.628
<i>This was made by an artist
who has frequently been in trouble</i>

1:03:45.712 --> 1:03:47.213
<i>in his own country.</i>

1:03:47.297 --> 1:03:51.301
I wanna thank all the watchers
who sent frowns to the government there,

1:03:51.384 --> 1:03:54.345
both for their persecution of the artist

1:03:54.429 --> 1:03:57.098
and for their restriction
on Internet freedoms.

1:03:57.182 --> 1:04:01.561
We have sent 180 million frowns
from the U.S. alone.

1:04:01.644 --> 1:04:04.773
You can bet that's gonna have
an effect on the regime.

1:04:07.358 --> 1:04:08.568
Annie.

1:04:11.362 --> 1:04:12.363
<i>Annie.</i>

1:04:13.865 --> 1:04:14.866
Annie!

1:04:18.286 --> 1:04:19.286
Annie!

1:04:26.628 --> 1:04:27.670
Annie!

1:04:29.714 --> 1:04:32.383
Annie Allerton!

1:04:43.311 --> 1:04:44.311
Are we alone?

1:04:45.897 --> 1:04:49.192
I have three minutes to use the bathroom
without the video on.

1:04:49.275 --> 1:04:50.693
Pervs.

1:04:52.821 --> 1:04:53.988
How are you?

1:04:56.282 --> 1:04:57.992
- Good.
- Well...

1:04:58.076 --> 1:04:59.077
you should be good.

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:00.161
You're killing it.

1:05:01.412 --> 1:05:02.247
Do you think?

1:05:02.330 --> 1:05:04.290
Oh, come on,
false modesty won't work here.

1:05:04.374 --> 1:05:05.374
You should be psyched.

1:05:06.584 --> 1:05:07.584
Yeah.

1:05:08.670 --> 1:05:10.713
- I am.
- You're a meteor. It's insane.

1:05:10.797 --> 1:05:12.817
People are coming to me
trying to get to you.

1:05:12.841 --> 1:05:14.008
It's... crazy.

1:05:15.844 --> 1:05:17.053
How are you really, Annie?

1:05:18.429 --> 1:05:19.514
You look wiped.

1:05:19.597 --> 1:05:22.600
Thanks, Mae.
You know how much I like to be told

1:05:22.684 --> 1:05:24.484
right after I appear
in front of your millions

1:05:24.519 --> 1:05:27.146
that I look terrible.
Thank you, you're sweet.

1:05:27.230 --> 1:05:28.523
Let me take you for dinner.

1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:32.443
You gotta eat sometime.

1:05:32.527 --> 1:05:35.989
Your camera and me looking so terrible.
That sounds fantastic, but, no.

1:05:36.072 --> 1:05:38.658
I just...
I'm worried about you.

1:05:38.741 --> 1:05:41.828
- You're working too hard.
- You're worried about me?

1:05:41.911 --> 1:05:43.663
You're... I'm worried about the EU,

1:05:43.746 --> 1:05:45.182
but it's good to know
you're worried about me.

1:05:45.206 --> 1:05:47.667
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Don't worry in any way.

1:05:51.045 --> 1:05:53.965
- I know you can handle it.
- Oh, thank you, Mae.

1:05:54.048 --> 1:05:56.634
Your confidence in me
will be the wind beneath my wings.

1:05:58.595 --> 1:05:59.595
How are your parents?

1:06:03.182 --> 1:06:04.183
Sorry.

1:06:06.644 --> 1:06:09.439
They're over that little... episode?

1:06:13.651 --> 1:06:16.321
I haven't heard from them, actually.

1:06:18.239 --> 1:06:20.366
I guess it'll just take some time.

1:06:20.450 --> 1:06:22.577
Sorry, Mae. Shit.

1:06:24.746 --> 1:06:25.747
I'm fried.

1:06:27.916 --> 1:06:29.626
And I have to pull another all-nighter.

1:06:31.210 --> 1:06:33.421
Stenton is on my ass all the time.

1:06:33.504 --> 1:06:36.966
I shouldn't have questioned him
about that whole Senator Williamson thing.

1:06:38.051 --> 1:06:41.679
And then...
there's all the new work on Completion.

1:06:42.764 --> 1:06:44.599
But I assume Bailey told you about that.

1:06:47.644 --> 1:06:50.730
Of course.

1:06:50.813 --> 1:06:52.941
I'll be there
at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow.

1:06:53.024 --> 1:06:54.024
What?

1:06:56.027 --> 1:06:58.863
- There's a Concept Kingdom...
- I know what it is. But you're going?

1:06:58.947 --> 1:07:03.743
- Yeah. Bailey said I should be there.
- And broadcast it?

1:07:05.620 --> 1:07:07.163
- Is that a problem?
- No.

1:07:07.246 --> 1:07:09.958
I'm just surprised, that's all.
Those meetings are sensitive.

1:07:10.041 --> 1:07:13.127
You know, maybe he's planning on
having you attend just the beginning.

1:07:13.211 --> 1:07:15.463
I mean, Mae,
you're in over your head.

1:07:18.049 --> 1:07:19.592
Are you leaving?

1:07:19.676 --> 1:07:21.010
Yeah.

1:07:22.095 --> 1:07:24.681
I'm really so far behind on everything,
I could just die.

1:07:28.643 --> 1:07:29.644
Annie?

1:07:31.312 --> 1:07:32.752
<i>Hello.</i>

1:07:34.649 --> 1:07:35.649
See ya.

1:07:45.910 --> 1:07:50.331
<i>So here's how many people voted
in the last national election.</i>

1:07:50.415 --> 1:07:53.376
<i>Here's how many were eligible to vote.</i>

1:07:55.503 --> 1:07:59.716
And here is how many Americans
are registered in the Circle.

1:08:01.300 --> 1:08:03.136
And there's that guy.

1:08:03.219 --> 1:08:05.346
So now we get down to the meat
of today's session,

1:08:05.430 --> 1:08:08.558
something we've discussed
with Congresswoman Santos and others.

1:08:09.934 --> 1:08:16.357
What if... your Circle profile
automatically registered you to vote?

1:08:18.192 --> 1:08:20.528
With True You,
in order to set up a profile,

1:08:20.611 --> 1:08:23.281
you have to be a real person
with a real address,

1:08:23.364 --> 1:08:26.993
the complete personal info,
real social security number,

1:08:27.076 --> 1:08:29.203
with all the information
that the government wants

1:08:29.287 --> 1:08:31.247
when you register to vote.

1:08:31.330 --> 1:08:35.376
So why wouldn't the state
consider you already registered

1:08:35.460 --> 1:08:37.086
when you open a Circle account?

1:08:38.171 --> 1:08:39.756
There's no reason.

1:08:39.839 --> 1:08:44.802
Uh, we've got verbal commitments
from governors of almost every state,

1:08:44.886 --> 1:08:49.891
and they've agreed to push for legislation
that would make your Circle account

1:08:49.974 --> 1:08:52.518
an automatic path to voter registration.

1:08:54.771 --> 1:08:55.771
Bravo.

1:08:59.358 --> 1:09:00.818
I think it's a great idea.

1:09:06.157 --> 1:09:08.618
Well, yes, Mae.

1:09:12.288 --> 1:09:14.540
Why couldn't we take it one step further?

1:09:15.541 --> 1:09:16.918
I mean, I...

1:09:17.001 --> 1:09:20.588
I don't have it
completely figured out yet...

1:09:20.671 --> 1:09:23.800
No, no, no, go on, go on, go on.
You started really well there.

1:09:23.883 --> 1:09:26.844
I like those words, "one step further."
It's how the company was built.

1:09:29.013 --> 1:09:32.975
Okay. Working backwards from your goal...

1:09:33.059 --> 1:09:34.644
Go on.

1:09:34.727 --> 1:09:37.605
We all agree 100 percent participation
is what we'd like.

1:09:37.688 --> 1:09:40.191
A hundred percent participation
is the ideal.

1:09:40.274 --> 1:09:43.444
That's the idealist's ideal, yes.

1:09:43.528 --> 1:09:47.907
And we already have 83 percent
of voting-age Americans

1:09:47.990 --> 1:09:49.408
registered to the Circle.

1:09:49.492 --> 1:09:50.701
Yep.

1:09:50.785 --> 1:09:52.620
And it seems we're on our way

1:09:52.703 --> 1:09:56.916
to users being able to register it
and maybe actually vote

1:09:56.999 --> 1:09:58.060
through their Circle account.

1:09:58.084 --> 1:10:02.630
Well, that's a small leap, but... Yes.
Okay, go on.

1:10:04.757 --> 1:10:09.887
Why not require every voting-age citizen
to have a Circle account?

1:10:09.971 --> 1:10:12.807
Let her finish. Let her finish.

1:10:12.890 --> 1:10:16.269
Okay, I know the initial reaction
will be resistance.

1:10:16.352 --> 1:10:19.772
I mean, how can we require anyone
to use our services?

1:10:20.857 --> 1:10:22.793
But there are all kinds of things
that are mandatory

1:10:22.817 --> 1:10:23.961
for citizens of this country.

1:10:23.985 --> 1:10:25.945
Yep. We have to pay taxes
we don't wanna pay.

1:10:26.028 --> 1:10:27.655
And we have to pay for Social Security.

1:10:27.738 --> 1:10:30.408
- We have to serve on juries.
- Right.

1:10:30.491 --> 1:10:32.910
And we have to pee indoors,
not on the street.

1:10:32.994 --> 1:10:35.288
- We do. We do have to be pee indoors.
- She's right.

1:10:35.371 --> 1:10:37.582
I mean, we have thousands of laws.

1:10:37.665 --> 1:10:40.835
We require citizens
to do hundreds of things,

1:10:40.918 --> 1:10:43.629
but we don't require them to vote?

1:10:45.506 --> 1:10:48.926
They are already doing this
in dozens of countries.

1:10:49.010 --> 1:10:53.431
With the technology we already have,
users will already be registered.

1:10:53.514 --> 1:10:58.644
That means you have 241 million voters
eligible to vote.

1:10:58.728 --> 1:11:03.274
You have 241 million voters
that have to vote.

1:11:05.818 --> 1:11:07.737
You have the full will of the nation.

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:10.489
- And how exactly do we do that?
- Annie.

1:11:11.741 --> 1:11:16.245
Well, you know,
it could be something as simple as a zing,

1:11:16.329 --> 1:11:20.666
"Hey, Annie.
Remember to take five minutes and vote."

1:11:20.750 --> 1:11:24.962
It's what we would do
with our own surveys. You know that.

1:11:25.046 --> 1:11:29.383
- But, Mae, what about stragglers?
- We all pay taxes.

1:11:31.010 --> 1:11:33.387
And what, 80 percent of us
did that online last year.

1:11:35.765 --> 1:11:38.559
Why not stop duplicating services?

1:11:39.727 --> 1:11:43.022
Why not just make it all part
of one unified system?

1:11:43.105 --> 1:11:47.985
You could pay your taxes,
vote, pay your parking ticket,

1:11:48.069 --> 1:11:50.279
all through your Circle account.

1:11:50.363 --> 1:11:53.074
We'd save users hundreds of hours
of inconvenience.

1:11:53.157 --> 1:11:56.410
- We'd save the government billions.
- Hundreds of billions.

1:11:56.494 --> 1:11:58.704
We could eliminate half of it overnight.

1:11:58.788 --> 1:12:01.040
Why wouldn't the government
just build a similar service?

1:12:01.123 --> 1:12:02.416
Why the hell does it need us?

1:12:05.461 --> 1:12:08.464
It would cost too much.
They don't have the expertise.

1:12:08.547 --> 1:12:11.926
- We already have the infrastructure.
- You're absolutely right.

1:12:12.009 --> 1:12:16.347
The government needs us
more than we need them.

1:12:16.430 --> 1:12:20.726
Imagine having the full will
of the people.

1:12:22.311 --> 1:12:23.354
Instantly.

1:12:25.606 --> 1:12:28.985
You'd have... true democracy

1:12:30.069 --> 1:12:32.321
for the first time in human history.

1:12:33.698 --> 1:12:35.538
This is such bullshit.

1:12:40.621 --> 1:12:43.124
No voter suppression.
You're voting from home.

1:12:43.207 --> 1:12:45.876
<i>Think of the implications
for totalitarian regimes.</i>

1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:47.545
No more rigged elections.

1:12:47.628 --> 1:12:49.731
The UN can demand
that they're held through the Circle.

1:12:49.755 --> 1:12:52.758
But only if everyone is heard.

1:12:52.842 --> 1:12:55.594
Every human on Earth.

1:12:55.678 --> 1:12:57.680
We can take the pulse of the nation,

1:12:57.763 --> 1:13:01.267
<i>everyone in the world in seconds
on any subject.</i>

1:13:01.350 --> 1:13:03.519
- It's the only way, right?
- Right.

1:13:03.602 --> 1:13:04.854
Yeah!

1:13:07.606 --> 1:13:11.694
So it looks like I've got 20 minutes here.

1:13:11.777 --> 1:13:14.238
Let's try Mom and Dad.

1:13:17.074 --> 1:13:18.635
Hey, Mae, what's up?

1:13:18.659 --> 1:13:19.660
Hi.

1:13:25.624 --> 1:13:28.127
- Hey, where have you been?
<i>- Mae.</i>

1:13:28.210 --> 1:13:31.380
I've seen your cameras aren't working.
I can send Tech out...

1:13:31.464 --> 1:13:34.008
<i>Yeah, we disconnected them.</i>

1:13:34.091 --> 1:13:35.634
<i>Sweetheart...</i>

1:13:36.802 --> 1:13:40.181
<i>We're sorry, but we,
we can't keep doing this.</i>

1:13:40.264 --> 1:13:43.976
<i>It's... Well, it's more than we ever...</i>

1:13:44.060 --> 1:13:47.146
<i>You know we love you,
and we don't wanna...</i>

1:13:47.229 --> 1:13:51.484
<i>- We love you. We love you.
- We have to have our privacy.</i>

1:13:51.567 --> 1:13:55.071
<i>And we're worried you don't realize
what you've gotten yourself into.</i>

1:13:55.154 --> 1:13:56.197
I'm so sorry.

1:13:57.323 --> 1:13:58.616
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1:13:58.699 --> 1:14:00.635
<i>- It's not you. It's us.
- No, we know that.</i>

1:14:00.659 --> 1:14:03.621
<i>- Yeah, it's us.
- We just need you to understand that.</i>

1:14:06.457 --> 1:14:09.585
- I love you.
<i>- We love you too.</i>

1:14:09.668 --> 1:14:10.668
<i>Bye, honey.</i>

1:14:13.964 --> 1:14:16.725
<i>- </i>You're the one, Mae!
- You're changing the world, Mae!

1:14:34.777 --> 1:14:39.490
Hello, everyone. I'm Mae Holland.

1:14:42.952 --> 1:14:46.080
Okay.

1:14:46.163 --> 1:14:49.792
We've had some good weeks
thinking about Completion,

1:14:49.875 --> 1:14:53.045
envisioning a day when everyone
is in the Circle,

1:14:53.129 --> 1:14:57.091
when all of humanity
is connected and united.

1:14:58.175 --> 1:14:59.844
And it will happen.

1:14:59.927 --> 1:15:02.388
Already, 22 nations have agreed
in principle

1:15:02.471 --> 1:15:05.724
to operate their elections
through the Circle

1:15:05.808 --> 1:15:10.646
with mandatory participation
from all of its citizens.

1:15:16.610 --> 1:15:22.158
And when everyone is united,
everyone is known, heard, accountable,

1:15:23.409 --> 1:15:25.077
they can be better served.

1:15:25.161 --> 1:15:29.623
But what about the people
who aren't part of the Circle,

1:15:29.707 --> 1:15:33.127
who don't want to be woven
into the fabric of society

1:15:33.210 --> 1:15:36.839
or worse, want to tear out that fabric?

1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:42.052
I want to introduce Soul Search.

1:15:42.136 --> 1:15:46.098
And we're putting it to the test
in front of the entire Circle audience,

1:15:46.182 --> 1:15:49.477
here and globally.

1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:50.561
Do you feel ready?

1:15:50.644 --> 1:15:52.688
Hell, yeah!

1:15:52.771 --> 1:15:54.356
<i>You went well so far.</i>

1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:55.524
<i>Great.</i>

1:15:58.068 --> 1:16:03.157
In seconds, the computer will select,
at random, a fugitive from justice,

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:06.660
a proven menace to our global community.

1:16:07.828 --> 1:16:10.831
Our assertion is that
whoever he or she is,

1:16:10.915 --> 1:16:15.252
Soul Search will locate them
in under 20 minutes.

1:16:15.336 --> 1:16:17.213
Wow.

1:16:20.591 --> 1:16:22.218
Let's select that fugitive.

1:16:23.969 --> 1:16:25.554
Okay.

1:16:25.638 --> 1:16:28.224
This is Fiona Highbridge,

1:16:28.307 --> 1:16:31.227
44 years old born in Manchester, England.

1:16:31.310 --> 1:16:34.605
She was convicted
of triple murder in 2004.

1:16:34.688 --> 1:16:37.107
She locked her three children
in the closet

1:16:38.150 --> 1:16:40.444
and went on holiday to Spain.

1:16:42.738 --> 1:16:43.989
They all starved.

1:16:45.783 --> 1:16:48.035
She was sent to prison in England
but escaped

1:16:48.118 --> 1:16:51.163
with the help of a guard
who she apparently seduced.

1:16:52.831 --> 1:16:57.169
Over a billion people are watching.

1:16:57.253 --> 1:16:59.129
Let's see how many are in the UK.

1:17:00.714 --> 1:17:03.425
Do you all think 14 million Brits

1:17:03.509 --> 1:17:06.220
and a billion global
participants worldwide

1:17:06.303 --> 1:17:09.515
can find Fiona Highbridge
in under 20 minutes?

1:17:09.598 --> 1:17:10.918
Yeah!

1:17:12.309 --> 1:17:14.228
Yeah!

1:17:14.311 --> 1:17:16.355
All right.

1:17:16.438 --> 1:17:18.023
Let's bring up the clock.

1:17:19.024 --> 1:17:20.734
Good.

1:17:20.818 --> 1:17:24.196
Is everyone ready?

1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:25.656
On your mark...

1:17:27.324 --> 1:17:28.409
get set...

1:17:29.743 --> 1:17:30.743
go!

1:17:38.586 --> 1:17:40.754
Okay, time to get serious.

1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:11.285
<i>I've got her, Mae.</i>

1:18:12.828 --> 1:18:13.828
<i>That's her.</i>

1:18:14.747 --> 1:18:16.707
Be careful.

1:18:16.790 --> 1:18:17.790
<i>I will.</i>

1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:28.052
Whoa!

1:18:29.219 --> 1:18:30.219
Whoa!

1:18:39.021 --> 1:18:40.606
<i>Fiona! Stop!</i>

1:18:41.690 --> 1:18:44.735
- Follow her.
<i>- Stop her!</i>

1:18:44.818 --> 1:18:46.445
<i>Somebody stop her! She's a killer!</i>

1:18:47.738 --> 1:18:48.739
<i>Stop her!</i>

1:18:49.740 --> 1:18:51.033
<i>Somebody stop her!</i>

1:18:52.534 --> 1:18:54.244
- Go!
- Grab her!

1:18:57.373 --> 1:18:59.249
<i>Stop her!</i>

1:18:59.333 --> 1:19:01.460
<i>Somebody grab her!</i>

1:19:01.543 --> 1:19:04.046
- <i>She must be kept safe.</i>
- Keep her safe.

1:19:04.129 --> 1:19:07.383
<i>- It's Fiona Highbridge!
- No! No! No!</i>

1:19:19.645 --> 1:19:20.729
<i>All right. Watch it.</i>

1:19:23.399 --> 1:19:24.399
<i>No.</i>

1:19:26.026 --> 1:19:27.026
Stop the clock.

1:19:29.613 --> 1:19:30.906
Soul Search, baby!

1:19:30.989 --> 1:19:33.450
I guess that's it.

1:19:43.168 --> 1:19:45.587
Let's do another!

1:19:45.671 --> 1:19:46.672
We could.

1:19:48.006 --> 1:19:49.818
- Um...
<i>- Maybe not a fugitive this time.</i>

1:19:49.842 --> 1:19:51.802
Let's try for a regular civilian.

1:19:53.262 --> 1:19:55.097
Okay, everyone.

1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:57.975
We're gonna find a regular person.

1:19:58.976 --> 1:20:01.103
It can be anyone.

1:20:01.186 --> 1:20:04.064
A relative, a lost love.

1:20:04.148 --> 1:20:08.944
When everyone can be found,
we can never lose a friend.

1:20:10.904 --> 1:20:12.740
We can take a suggestion
from the audience.

1:20:12.823 --> 1:20:16.827
- Uh... anyone?
- Find Mercer!

1:20:19.955 --> 1:20:22.374
I'm pretty sure
he doesn't wanna be found.

1:20:23.751 --> 1:20:25.419
- Anyone else?
- Where's Mercer?

1:20:25.502 --> 1:20:29.798
<i>No, Mae, this is what Soul Search
is all about as well as Completion.</i>

1:20:29.882 --> 1:20:30.883
Other suggestions?

1:20:30.966 --> 1:20:32.819
- Let's try Mercer.
- Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!

1:20:32.843 --> 1:20:33.862
<i>It's the whole point
of Soul Search, Mae.</i>

1:20:33.886 --> 1:20:34.720
No.

1:20:34.803 --> 1:20:37.014
Mercer! Mercer!

1:20:37.097 --> 1:20:38.992
- Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!
- No, no, no, no.

1:20:39.016 --> 1:20:40.684
No, I...

1:20:40.768 --> 1:20:43.187
<i>Mae, this is the right choice.</i>

1:20:43.270 --> 1:20:45.564
Wait. Hey, everybody.

1:20:45.647 --> 1:20:47.527
Hey.

1:20:48.066 --> 1:20:50.402
I think it's time we reunited
Mae and Mercer, don't you?

1:20:51.403 --> 1:20:53.614
All right then.
And through the power of the Circle,

1:20:53.697 --> 1:20:56.200
let's bring them
back together again, okay?

1:20:56.283 --> 1:21:00.037
The perfect use of Soul Search.
Let's find your friend.

1:21:02.623 --> 1:21:03.874
Go, Mae, now.

1:21:14.384 --> 1:21:16.845
Okay.

1:21:19.890 --> 1:21:26.063
So our second Soul Search today
involves not a fugitive from justice,

1:21:26.146 --> 1:21:28.565
but you might say a fugitive from, um...

1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:30.900
a friendship.

1:21:38.992 --> 1:21:40.828
This is my friend Mercer.

1:21:41.870 --> 1:21:44.456
I haven't seen him in a while.

1:21:44.540 --> 1:21:45.833
I'd love to see him again.

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:52.214
Like Fiona, though, he is someone
who is trying not to be found,

1:21:52.297 --> 1:21:54.299
but unlike Fiona, he's not a criminal.

1:21:55.843 --> 1:21:57.010
He's good, people.

1:22:04.810 --> 1:22:06.610
Let's see if we can break
our previous record.

1:22:06.687 --> 1:22:08.355
Whoo!

1:22:29.209 --> 1:22:30.919
Oh, yeah.

1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:33.297
Unbelievable.

1:22:33.380 --> 1:22:35.299
Can you believe that? Yes!

1:22:37.509 --> 1:22:39.052
<i>Do you think he's in here?</i>

1:22:41.847 --> 1:22:43.640
<i>- Mercer!
- Mercer!</i>

1:22:43.724 --> 1:22:44.641
<i>Mercer, are you in there?</i>

1:22:44.725 --> 1:22:47.394
<i>Are you, like, killing deer,
making chandeliers?</i>

1:22:49.313 --> 1:22:52.166
<i>Mercer, we know you're in there.
We see your truck. It's right here.</i>

1:22:52.190 --> 1:22:54.043
<i>- I think he's in there.
- Fine. Let's go around.</i>

1:22:54.067 --> 1:22:57.321
<i>Oh, my God, he's in there!</i>

1:22:57.404 --> 1:22:59.281
<i>Mercer, come out. He's gotta be here.</i>

1:22:59.364 --> 1:23:01.575
Remember to be nice, okay?

1:23:01.658 --> 1:23:02.951
<i>Mercer, we know you're in there.</i>

1:23:03.035 --> 1:23:04.870
You found where he is. You did it.

1:23:04.953 --> 1:23:06.204
I think we should leave.

1:23:06.288 --> 1:23:08.916
<i>No, Mae, stay on this.</i>

1:23:08.999 --> 1:23:11.084
<i>You've got millions of people
enjoying this.</i>

1:23:11.168 --> 1:23:12.836
<i>There he is. There he is.</i>

1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:15.672
<i>There he is. We just got Mercer.
I cannot believe this.</i>

1:23:15.756 --> 1:23:17.466
<i>There he is! He's in the driveway!</i>

1:23:24.348 --> 1:23:26.433
<i>Leave me alone! Jesus Christ!</i>

1:23:47.871 --> 1:23:49.289
You're kidding me.

1:23:53.710 --> 1:23:56.296
Can someone please get me audio
on the camera?

1:23:58.006 --> 1:23:59.424
Mercer.

1:23:59.508 --> 1:24:02.469
Mercer, stop driving. It's just me.

1:24:02.552 --> 1:24:04.179
Mercer, stop the truck.

1:24:04.262 --> 1:24:06.390
You're surrounded by friends.

1:24:07.766 --> 1:24:09.518
Can we turn the speaker up?

1:24:10.769 --> 1:24:11.770
Mercer.

1:24:13.271 --> 1:24:14.439
Can you hear me?

1:24:15.691 --> 1:24:17.109
Mercer, it's me.

1:24:17.192 --> 1:24:18.792
You're surrounded by friends.

1:24:22.447 --> 1:24:24.408
Mercer, stop.

1:24:47.639 --> 1:24:49.307
How you doing, sweetie?

1:24:51.810 --> 1:24:54.438
You've been in bed for three days.

1:24:55.605 --> 1:24:58.442
Come out in the garden
with me today, okay?

1:24:58.525 --> 1:25:01.862
I've got some new snapdragons
that need to be planted.

1:25:03.155 --> 1:25:04.156
Okay?

1:25:05.365 --> 1:25:06.366
Honey.

1:25:09.619 --> 1:25:10.620
Oh, honey.

1:25:12.372 --> 1:25:13.957
Oh.

1:25:15.834 --> 1:25:18.378
Oh.

1:25:18.462 --> 1:25:20.982
<i>The California
Department of Motor Vehicles</i>

1:25:21.006 --> 1:25:23.633
<i>has proposed regulation
that self-driving cars</i>

1:25:23.717 --> 1:25:26.678
<i>should be required to have
a licensed driver inside.</i>

1:25:26.762 --> 1:25:28.180
<i>Is that a good principle?</i>

1:25:28.263 --> 1:25:31.099
<i>Yeah, I mean, I think obviously,</i>

1:25:31.183 --> 1:25:33.685
<i>where technology is today
that is a good principle,</i>

1:25:33.769 --> 1:25:36.164
<i>and of course, we would not suggest
putting something unsafe on the road.</i>

1:25:36.188 --> 1:25:37.647
<i>That's why we have fed...</i>

1:27:33.847 --> 1:27:34.847
<i>Mae.</i>

1:27:35.891 --> 1:27:37.267
Where are you?

1:27:37.350 --> 1:27:40.061
- Are we alone?
- Yes.

1:27:40.145 --> 1:27:41.146
Are we?

1:27:41.229 --> 1:27:42.230
Yes.

1:27:44.441 --> 1:27:47.402
How is it daytime where you are?

1:27:47.485 --> 1:27:49.863
Wait, you're in Scotland.

1:27:49.946 --> 1:27:52.449
Yep, I went home. Can you see?

1:27:54.409 --> 1:27:55.869
What happened?

1:27:55.952 --> 1:27:58.747
What, besides almost ODing
on speed and Soylent?

1:27:58.830 --> 1:28:00.582
Well, I found out I'm allergic to wheat.

1:28:04.294 --> 1:28:07.172
Um... I don't know.

1:28:07.255 --> 1:28:08.548
I guess I almost died?

1:28:12.344 --> 1:28:14.304
Oh, come on, no, don't.
Don't make me cry.

1:28:14.387 --> 1:28:16.806
Come on. No.
I'm not going to cry anymore.

1:28:19.017 --> 1:28:20.017
You getting better there?

1:28:21.102 --> 1:28:23.146
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

1:28:23.230 --> 1:28:28.860
I eat. I look out the window.
I come out here, and I think I daydream.

1:28:28.944 --> 1:28:30.028
Hadn't done that in years.

1:28:31.529 --> 1:28:32.614
I'm glad you called.

1:28:35.742 --> 1:28:37.244
I didn't want to lose you, too.

1:28:38.787 --> 1:28:39.788
<i>I know.</i>

1:28:41.581 --> 1:28:43.875
Listen, Mae, I'm really,
really sorry about Mercer.

1:28:44.918 --> 1:28:47.754
And I'm a shit friend.
I should've said something sooner.

1:28:47.837 --> 1:28:49.214
I should've, and I'm sorry.

1:28:50.966 --> 1:28:52.175
It's just so horrible.

1:28:54.844 --> 1:28:56.346
Have they spoken to you about it?

1:28:57.681 --> 1:28:58.682
Not yet.

1:28:59.849 --> 1:29:01.476
I'm going in tomorrow.

1:29:01.559 --> 1:29:04.813
<i>Uh-huh. They ask for forgiveness
and never for permission.</i>

1:29:04.896 --> 1:29:06.982
They have to go.
They've broken a hundred laws.

1:29:07.065 --> 1:29:10.068
They've made me suffer
a thousand regulations.

1:29:10.151 --> 1:29:11.695
There's got to be a way to...

1:29:11.778 --> 1:29:14.030
What? Stop people doing bad shit?

1:29:14.114 --> 1:29:16.157
Yeah.

1:29:17.534 --> 1:29:20.745
Do you need some time away here, too?
I've got an extra bed if you want it.

1:29:25.292 --> 1:29:29.212
This feels so good, just being with you.

1:29:29.296 --> 1:29:31.840
- Even like this.
- Yeah.

1:29:32.966 --> 1:29:34.175
Yeah. I know.

1:29:37.470 --> 1:29:39.681
This is going to sound crazy. But...

1:29:39.764 --> 1:29:41.808
I keep having this feeling that...

1:29:42.851 --> 1:29:45.228
Mercer would still be here
if we hadn't lost touch.

1:29:45.312 --> 1:29:47.272
No, come on,
what were you supposed to do?

1:29:47.355 --> 1:29:49.649
I mean, you know, he drifted away.

1:29:50.650 --> 1:29:51.776
It happens.

1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:54.946
Yes, but we have this technology,
all this power.

1:29:55.030 --> 1:29:58.408
Well, I mean, technology
didn't exactly help the situation.

1:30:00.410 --> 1:30:01.411
What if it could?

1:30:07.792 --> 1:30:10.670
Hey, your dad woke up at 4:00
this morning,

1:30:10.754 --> 1:30:12.589
and your light was still on.

1:30:12.672 --> 1:30:15.258
What were you doing in your room?
Were you on the phone?

1:30:17.010 --> 1:30:18.595
It helped.

1:30:18.678 --> 1:30:20.513
I have friends all over the world.

1:30:21.931 --> 1:30:22.932
They care.

1:30:23.016 --> 1:30:24.350
Mm.

1:30:24.434 --> 1:30:28.021
- I spoke to Annie.
- How is she?

1:30:28.104 --> 1:30:29.731
Good. Better.

1:30:30.899 --> 1:30:32.567
I realized how much I missed her.

1:30:36.863 --> 1:30:38.615
I have to go back.

1:30:38.698 --> 1:30:40.116
Go back where?

1:30:42.535 --> 1:30:43.661
Not to the Circle.

1:30:43.745 --> 1:30:45.789
The Circle didn't kill Mercer, Mom.

1:30:45.872 --> 1:30:48.416
It was a bad tool, a bad system.

1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:51.419
It... It can be fixed.

1:30:52.879 --> 1:30:55.465
We're not gonna become Amish, Mom.

1:30:55.548 --> 1:30:58.176
I... When someone dies in a plane crash,

1:30:58.259 --> 1:31:02.180
you don't abandon planes,
you make them safer.

1:31:02.263 --> 1:31:03.932
Mae, at least wait a bit.

1:31:04.015 --> 1:31:05.892
I'm the only one who can do this.

1:31:07.393 --> 1:31:08.394
I'm sorry.

1:31:10.063 --> 1:31:11.564
I love you.

1:31:35.088 --> 1:31:37.382
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

1:31:37.465 --> 1:31:40.343
<i>Mae. How are you holding up?</i>

1:31:40.426 --> 1:31:43.388
<i>Better, actually.
I'm coming in to see them today.</i>

1:31:43.471 --> 1:31:46.808
<i>- But I need your help.
- Sure. Name it, anything you need.</i>

1:32:16.504 --> 1:32:18.899
We were worried
when we didn't hear from you for so long.

1:32:18.923 --> 1:32:20.675
We were very concerned.

1:32:20.758 --> 1:32:23.052
No contact for four days.
Your camera was off.

1:32:23.136 --> 1:32:24.136
How are you doing?

1:32:27.265 --> 1:32:28.265
I'm okay.

1:32:29.350 --> 1:32:31.370
Tom and I have been talking
about how little we knew

1:32:31.394 --> 1:32:33.313
about this young man Mercer.

1:32:33.396 --> 1:32:35.607
He's someone we should
have been able to help.

1:32:35.690 --> 1:32:38.443
A fund should be established
for his family.

1:32:39.569 --> 1:32:42.071
Yeah, absolutely, that's done.

1:32:42.155 --> 1:32:45.116
Listen, Mae, we would like
to offer you a new role

1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:49.871
here at the Circle
with no formal obligation,

1:32:49.954 --> 1:32:51.915
maybe a lighter schedule.

1:32:51.998 --> 1:32:54.500
You can choose your own projects,
and you can think long-term.

1:32:54.584 --> 1:32:56.920
You could take pottery, if you wanted.

1:32:57.003 --> 1:32:58.483
I don't know if you're aware of this,

1:32:58.546 --> 1:33:01.299
- but one of our founders, Ty Lafitte...
- Yeah.

1:33:01.382 --> 1:33:06.679
Was given the same opportunity,
and now he loves his freedom.

1:33:06.763 --> 1:33:09.974
And I don't know
if this is any consolation,

1:33:10.058 --> 1:33:13.436
but at our next Dream Friday...

1:33:13.519 --> 1:33:15.396
We're going to imagine a world

1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:19.192
in which every disturbed young man
could be kept safe.

1:33:20.902 --> 1:33:22.195
Would you like to join us?

1:33:24.322 --> 1:33:26.950
I'm not sure I'm ready for that. But...

1:33:28.910 --> 1:33:29.994
thanks for the invitation.

1:33:30.995 --> 1:33:31.995
Take your time.

1:33:57.647 --> 1:34:01.025
I did what you asked.
You won't believe the shit I found.

1:34:01.109 --> 1:34:05.530
It's worse than I could've imagined.
And, and look, Mae, I'm so sorry.

1:34:05.613 --> 1:34:09.492
I never met him, but they should build
a monument to Mercer.

1:34:11.744 --> 1:34:15.415
- Yeah.
- I mean, this... this changes everything.

1:34:15.498 --> 1:34:18.543
Okay, he's the martyr
who will wake everyone up, right?

1:34:18.626 --> 1:34:22.088
I don't know what you're planning,
but if you turn that camera back on,

1:34:22.171 --> 1:34:25.091
whatever you say about the Circle
is heard around the world,

1:34:25.174 --> 1:34:26.801
and it changes everything.

1:34:42.191 --> 1:34:43.191
<i>Hello</i>.

1:34:46.863 --> 1:34:47.864
Hello again.

1:34:53.578 --> 1:34:54.912
<i>- Hi!
- Hey, Mae.</i>

1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:06.090
And that is how it should have been,

1:35:06.174 --> 1:35:08.676
how it could've been,
but we didn't have the technology.

1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:10.011
But we will.

1:35:10.094 --> 1:35:11.471
And when we do,

1:35:11.554 --> 1:35:14.849
when every vehicle
is known and connected,

1:35:14.932 --> 1:35:18.269
the data we have will help us
improve traffic patterns,

1:35:18.353 --> 1:35:24.942
keep drivers safe, and optimize
Circle services across all platforms.

1:35:25.026 --> 1:35:28.154
Shopping. Lodging.

1:35:28.237 --> 1:35:29.781
Attractions.

1:35:30.823 --> 1:35:32.492
Attractions like Mae Holland.

1:35:32.575 --> 1:35:34.255
Mae, come on out here.

1:35:34.327 --> 1:35:36.704
<i>Come on out here. Gosh, Mae.</i>

1:35:36.788 --> 1:35:39.123
<i>Oh, you're transparent again.
Look at that.</i>

1:35:39.207 --> 1:35:41.376
Hello, hello.

1:35:41.459 --> 1:35:42.459
Mae Holland.

1:35:42.502 --> 1:35:46.005
Welcome back, Mae!

1:35:46.089 --> 1:35:51.469
Now, Mae is a brave person

1:35:51.552 --> 1:35:53.388
because even amid her grieving,

1:35:53.471 --> 1:35:58.309
she knows that she has a responsibility
to her followers,

1:35:58.393 --> 1:35:59.936
to the whole world, really.

1:36:01.521 --> 1:36:05.942
Thanks for saying that, Eamon.
And I couldn't agree with you more.

1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:10.279
I know that Tom, he agrees, too.

1:36:10.363 --> 1:36:14.450
Right, Tom? You want to come out?

1:36:14.534 --> 1:36:17.161
- Come on.
- There you are.

1:36:21.124 --> 1:36:24.627
First, I want to thank everyone here
and around the world

1:36:24.710 --> 1:36:28.047
for the support you've given me
since we lost Mercer.

1:36:28.131 --> 1:36:32.885
These past days,
I've realized something about myself

1:36:32.969 --> 1:36:34.137
and about the Circle.

1:36:35.304 --> 1:36:37.640
It's that I don't want to be disconnected.

1:36:39.058 --> 1:36:43.020
I don't want to have to search
for friends, family, my loved ones.

1:36:44.230 --> 1:36:45.731
We lost track of Mercer.

1:36:47.275 --> 1:36:49.861
But what if we never lost touch
with each other?

1:36:52.071 --> 1:36:53.865
What if instead of searching...

1:36:55.199 --> 1:36:56.367
we always knew?

1:36:58.494 --> 1:37:03.416
What I am proposing is radical openness
and unbroken connection.

1:37:06.169 --> 1:37:08.129
It would have to start here.

1:37:08.212 --> 1:37:09.881
Mm-hm.

1:37:09.964 --> 1:37:13.342
You know the usual hypocrisy
of the digital world.

1:37:13.426 --> 1:37:17.597
We want everything in the Cloud,
and yet our leaders...

1:37:19.557 --> 1:37:21.392
live above it.

1:37:21.476 --> 1:37:26.105
So I want to invite Eamon and Tom

1:37:26.189 --> 1:37:30.568
to join me in this experiment
that they've pioneered.

1:37:32.195 --> 1:37:37.950
I invite them to set an example
for the Circle and the world...

1:37:41.037 --> 1:37:42.580
to go transparent.

1:37:47.293 --> 1:37:48.878
What do you say, guys?

1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:51.881
Will you join me?

1:37:59.013 --> 1:38:03.017
Wouldn't it be great to know
their every move, their every word?

1:38:03.100 --> 1:38:07.480
From now on,
every message, meeting, phone call,

1:38:07.563 --> 1:38:12.818
all will be public,
knowable, never erased.

1:38:13.986 --> 1:38:16.155
In fact, Ty Lafitte has helped us
make every document

1:38:16.239 --> 1:38:19.867
in the company's history public.

1:38:19.951 --> 1:38:22.495
Every message, every plan including...

1:38:22.578 --> 1:38:25.831
And this is my favorite part,
every e-mail,

1:38:25.915 --> 1:38:29.961
from Tom and Eamon's accounts,
and their private accounts...

1:38:30.962 --> 1:38:33.148
And their secondary
confidential accounts.

1:38:33.172 --> 1:38:37.134
And even their super-secret
scrambled code accounts,

1:38:37.218 --> 1:38:43.140
that nobody, not even their
assistants or wives knew existed.

1:38:44.642 --> 1:38:45.768
Until now.

1:38:48.729 --> 1:38:50.606
It's all been sent to you already.

1:38:54.277 --> 1:38:56.445
We are so fucked.

1:38:56.529 --> 1:39:00.449
I think we're entitled
to that kind of access. Don't you?

1:39:00.533 --> 1:39:03.953
Yeah.

1:39:05.079 --> 1:39:07.248
Mae, you are a very brave woman
to do this.

1:39:13.129 --> 1:39:16.215
There are no more secrets.

1:39:16.299 --> 1:39:18.050
Privacy was a temporary thing.

1:39:19.260 --> 1:39:20.344
And now it's over.

1:39:22.096 --> 1:39:24.265
We won't live in the shadows anymore.

1:39:25.683 --> 1:39:27.893
Hey. Good timing.

1:39:47.455 --> 1:39:48.456
Thank you.

1:39:49.707 --> 1:39:51.375
Thank you.

1:39:51.459 --> 1:39:58.424
I'm tired of hiding,
these passwords and secret knocks,

1:39:58.507 --> 1:40:01.302
the difference between public and private.

1:40:02.928 --> 1:40:03.971
Aren't you all?

1:40:05.389 --> 1:40:07.350
Come to think of it,

1:40:07.433 --> 1:40:09.352
I'm tired of standing here in the dark.

1:40:11.312 --> 1:40:12.521
Don't worry.

1:40:12.605 --> 1:40:17.401
Eamon will catch up. Or maybe he won't.

1:40:17.485 --> 1:40:20.237
Either way, it's time for a change.

1:40:20.321 --> 1:40:22.239
We're gonna remake this place.

1:40:22.323 --> 1:40:27.912
And if we do it right,
we will set an example for everyone.

1:40:27.995 --> 1:40:29.580
The future won't wait.
