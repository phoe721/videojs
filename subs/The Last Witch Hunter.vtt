01:27.682 --> 01:29.815
I swear to you,

01:29.849 --> 01:33.082
every single mother and daughter,

01:34.149 --> 01:37.748
father and son taken from us

01:37.782 --> 01:40.582
<i>by the Black Plague will be avenged.</i>

01:43.716 --> 01:45.948
<i>It is their Witch Queen</i>

01:45.982 --> 01:48.982
<i>who brought this
curse upon our lands.</i>

01:50.282 --> 01:53.248
<i>And in her death lies our salvation.</i>

01:57.949 --> 02:00.216
<i>Be warned, brothers.</i>

02:00.250 --> 02:02.616
<i>She will never truly perish</i>

02:02.650 --> 02:06.249
<i>until her heart beats its last.</i>

02:06.283 --> 02:08.616
<i>Let fear be dead to us.</i>

02:08.650 --> 02:11.116
<i>There is no going back,</i>

02:11.150 --> 02:14.017
<i>for there is nothing to go back to.</i>

02:26.851 --> 02:29.316
What is it, Dolan?

02:35.717 --> 02:38.084
The Hexen are amongst us.

02:41.651 --> 02:43.917
This place reeks of death.

02:43.951 --> 02:45.317
Keep your wits about you.

02:45.351 --> 02:47.284
Stay close.

02:51.816 --> 02:53.049
It's her!

02:53.083 --> 02:55.050
It's the Queen!

03:04.851 --> 03:06.817
The magic.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.250
Stay back!

03:36.784 --> 03:39.717
By iron and fire!

03:41.884 --> 03:43.817
Help us!

03:49.019 --> 03:50.952
- Dolan!
- The Queen!

04:07.020 --> 04:08.752
Heavenly Father,

04:08.786 --> 04:10.317
protect us from these demons.

04:14.786 --> 04:17.219
Ah!

04:21.986 --> 04:24.253
Stay in formation, men!

04:43.918 --> 04:45.719
Father!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.687
Father!

04:49.220 --> 04:53.319
Father, I missed you.

04:53.353 --> 04:54.953
You're not real.

04:54.987 --> 04:57.286
You can't be.

05:31.286 --> 05:33.687
You breed like rats.

05:33.721 --> 05:35.187
You put stone on top of stone

05:35.221 --> 05:37.721
and then live in your own filth.

05:37.755 --> 05:41.753
You are trespassers on our world.

05:41.787 --> 05:45.653
This is why I created the Plague.

05:45.687 --> 05:49.987
It's why every one of you must perish.

06:23.655 --> 06:26.354
Ah!

06:37.721 --> 06:39.654
By iron

06:43.222 --> 06:45.021
and fire.

06:45.054 --> 06:47.655
Everyone you love is gone.

06:47.689 --> 06:50.154
I've seen it in your eyes.

06:50.188 --> 06:52.989
You wish for death.

06:53.023 --> 06:55.155
Today we both die.

07:10.856 --> 07:13.389
I curse you with life.

07:14.722 --> 07:17.889
To never know peace.

07:20.056 --> 07:23.356
To walk the Earth alone for eternity.

07:26.989 --> 07:31.855
You will never die.

08:03.823 --> 08:05.856
Thank you.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.356
Excuse me, miss?

08:11.390 --> 08:13.722
Sir, how can I help you?

08:41.690 --> 08:43.623
Magic.

09:23.225 --> 09:25.157
Hey...

09:26.224 --> 09:27.390
Watch it!

09:27.424 --> 09:30.024
Sorry. Totally my fault.

09:32.059 --> 09:34.224
Excuse me.

09:39.259 --> 09:40.224
You're the witch hunter.

09:40.258 --> 09:42.125
Yeah.

09:42.159 --> 09:43.391
I didn't do anything.

09:43.425 --> 09:44.891
Let's see it.

09:44.925 --> 09:46.991
See what?

09:47.025 --> 09:48.192
Come on.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.191
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

09:53.225 --> 09:54.724
<i>the Captain has turned on...</i>

09:54.758 --> 09:57.192
Be glad you didn't get them wet.

09:59.791 --> 10:02.125
I've been looking for these for a while.

10:02.159 --> 10:04.325
These are ancient runes.

10:04.359 --> 10:06.025
They can manipulate weather.

10:06.059 --> 10:08.891
Rain, wind, cold, heat...

10:08.925 --> 10:11.991
And you just jammed them
together in your bag?

10:12.025 --> 10:13.625
You know what you get
when you mix a thunderstorm

10:13.659 --> 10:15.759
with cool, moist air at 40,000 feet?

10:18.225 --> 10:19.959
It's simple science.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.858
Unbelievable.

10:28.892 --> 10:32.592
You witches have no idea
the power you've got.

11:20.994 --> 11:22.993
Oh, my God.

11:25.327 --> 11:27.027
Are you gonna turn me
over to the Witch Council?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.693
No.

11:28.727 --> 11:30.326
You're gonna kill me?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.993
Kill you?

11:33.027 --> 11:35.860
I'm tryin' to stop you
from killing yourself.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.026
Enjoy New York.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.626
Sir, "Fasten seatbelts" signs are on.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.627
I need you to take a seat.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.628
My name is Kaulder.

11:48.894 --> 11:51.127
I need you to get back
to your seat, Kaulder.

11:51.161 --> 11:53.827
I'd love to hear about
growing up in Sefrou.

11:56.128 --> 11:58.059
How'd you know?

11:58.093 --> 12:00.060
Haven't had an accent in years.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.160
I've met a lot of people in my life.

12:03.194 --> 12:05.595
You'd be amazed what you pick up.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.960
<i>Witches live among us in secret.</i>

12:11.994 --> 12:15.159
<i>Their magic passed down
from an ancient race,</i>

12:15.193 --> 12:19.161
<i>diluted, half-forgotten,
but dangerously powerful.</i>

12:20.195 --> 12:23.861
<i>After centuries of conflict,
a truce was forged.</i>

12:23.895 --> 12:25.628
<i>Witches would be allowed to live</i>

12:25.662 --> 12:27.394
<i>and govern themselves
if they followed</i>

12:27.428 --> 12:33.294
<i>one strict rule, that magic
never be used against humans.</i>

12:33.328 --> 12:35.794
<i>But a truce is a fragile thing.</i>

12:35.828 --> 12:36.861
<i>There are some who long for</i>

12:36.895 --> 12:40.128
<i>the return of the old ways,</i>

12:40.162 --> 12:42.861
<i>the dark days of the Witch Queen.</i>

12:42.895 --> 12:46.261
<i>It is those whom Kaulder deals with.</i>

12:46.295 --> 12:51.261
<i>For 800 years, he has
served The Axe and Cross.</i>

12:51.295 --> 12:56.262
<i>Together we have kept
watch and kept the peace.</i>

13:07.294 --> 13:09.261
Uh, I'm sorry, Father
Dolan. He's in a meeting.

13:09.295 --> 13:11.228
Oh.

13:22.063 --> 13:25.229
The meeting has concluded.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.728
<i>I serve The Axe and Cross</i>

13:26.762 --> 13:28.261
<i>in a very different manner.</i>

13:28.295 --> 13:32.662
<i>I am the 36th Dolan, and
I write Kaulder's history.</i>

13:32.696 --> 13:34.895
<i>I am his handler, his confessor,</i>

13:34.929 --> 13:36.630
<i>and, I like to think, his friend.</i>

13:36.663 --> 13:39.396
You have no sense of time.

13:39.430 --> 13:42.861
Course I do. It's just
different than yours.

13:42.895 --> 13:45.795
I assume your mission was a success?

13:45.828 --> 13:48.730
You recovered the weather
runes without incident?

13:48.764 --> 13:51.062
What happened to the iPad I gave you?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.162
I re-gifted it.

13:53.196 --> 13:55.061
We're not all as adaptable as you.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.762
You know paper's the past.

13:56.796 --> 13:59.662
It's also a useful object
on which to record it.

14:01.896 --> 14:04.863
Are you reminiscing
about the Ludwig affair?

14:04.897 --> 14:07.596
I'm in a sentimental mood.

14:09.064 --> 14:11.030
Ah.

14:11.064 --> 14:13.062
About my retirement?

14:13.096 --> 14:14.997
That's why you've come back.

14:15.031 --> 14:17.096
We have had a good run.

14:17.130 --> 14:19.662
We took out some nasty covens.

14:19.696 --> 14:21.763
You're really ready to call it quits?

14:21.797 --> 14:23.162
It's only been 50 years.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.963
I'm finally getting used to you.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.230
Oh. Is that all it took?

14:29.031 --> 14:31.130
I'll miss you, kid.

14:33.729 --> 14:35.664
This is a Waterman 402.

14:35.698 --> 14:36.996
I had your initials engraved on it.

14:37.030 --> 14:38.663
It's very rare.

14:38.697 --> 14:40.297
Probably lowered the value quite a bit.

14:40.331 --> 14:42.264
Not to me.

14:45.131 --> 14:48.162
You reconsider, you can still keep the pen.

14:48.196 --> 14:50.230
I think you'll like my successor.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.730
I'm leaving you in more modern hands.

14:52.764 --> 14:54.697
What about the vow you took?

14:54.731 --> 14:58.863
I vowed to face death at your side.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.696
Not to work until I keel over.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.263
Thirty-five Dolans have come before you.

15:05.997 --> 15:07.631
Here's to the only one

15:07.665 --> 15:08.963
whose advice I ever listened to.

15:08.997 --> 15:11.231
Only to ignore it.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.831
But I always listen.

15:14.865 --> 15:16.630
What if you were retiring, too?

15:18.098 --> 15:19.896
I mean, what would you do

15:19.930 --> 15:21.696
if your next mission was your last?

15:21.730 --> 15:22.796
But it won't be.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.131
Humor me.

15:24.165 --> 15:26.830
I have no complaints.

15:26.864 --> 15:28.131
Every day I wake up,

15:28.165 --> 15:29.764
the world sleeps a little easier.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.131
Kaulder, you have tasted more of life

15:32.165 --> 15:34.365
than I can ever imagine,

15:34.399 --> 15:38.397
but it's been a long time
since you really lived.

15:38.431 --> 15:40.831
You're missing out on the best part

15:40.865 --> 15:43.264
of our brief stay in this world.

15:43.298 --> 15:46.130
The part where you share it.

15:46.164 --> 15:49.130
Find someone to trust.

15:50.932 --> 15:52.897
I trust you.

15:52.931 --> 15:54.932
Perhaps someone a little more comely.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.832
I know, I haven't lived

15:58.866 --> 16:00.632
as long and rich a life as you,

16:00.666 --> 16:02.299
but I do know that there is more to it

16:02.332 --> 16:04.631
than a parade of stewardesses

16:04.665 --> 16:08.265
marching to the dulcet tones
of <i>Moonlight Sonata.</i>

16:10.033 --> 16:11.698
Now what in the world do you know

16:11.732 --> 16:14.032
about stewardesses anyway?

16:14.066 --> 16:15.697
I wasn't born a priest.

16:17.698 --> 16:20.331
Let's do some work.

16:20.365 --> 16:21.864
I know you think it's dull,

16:21.898 --> 16:24.699
but let's start at the beginning.

16:47.034 --> 16:49.264
It goes without saying,

16:49.298 --> 16:52.032
but you've served with great distinction.

16:52.066 --> 16:54.298
If I may, when I meet Kaulder tomorrow,

16:54.332 --> 16:56.200
I should play it cool, right?

16:56.234 --> 16:58.332
No coffee until after the ritual.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.099
Don't worry about your style.

17:00.133 --> 17:02.000
He'll take the piss out of you anyway.

17:02.034 --> 17:03.967
But you'll be fine.

17:05.034 --> 17:09.865
It's, uh, Kaulder that I worry about.

17:09.899 --> 17:11.698
You worry about Kaulder?

17:11.732 --> 17:13.166
Do you know how the elders

17:13.200 --> 17:15.265
of The Axe and Cross refer to him?

17:15.299 --> 17:16.634
They call him "The Weapon."

17:16.668 --> 17:17.865
When I put in my reports,

17:17.899 --> 17:19.333
all they want to know is numbers.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.766
How many witches I've
turned over for detention.

17:21.799 --> 17:23.832
How many slain for breaking the law.

17:23.866 --> 17:26.700
Can you blame them? What
he does is so important.

17:26.734 --> 17:31.065
Yes, that's true, but
he isn't just a weapon.

17:31.099 --> 17:33.734
And those of us who know the truth,

17:33.768 --> 17:36.034
we bear responsibility.

17:37.133 --> 17:41.867
Whatever happens, promise
me you'll watch out for him.

17:41.901 --> 17:45.265
Of course. That's my job.

17:53.668 --> 17:55.601
Taxi!

18:37.368 --> 18:38.934
Hello?

18:38.968 --> 18:40.735
<i>Kaulder?</i>

18:40.769 --> 18:43.800
<i>Dolan the 36th passed away
peacefully last night.</i>

18:43.834 --> 18:45.868
<i>The ceremony will be tomorrow.</i>

18:47.435 --> 18:49.867
<i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

18:52.201 --> 18:55.202
Thirty-six have taken the
name "Dolan" before you.

18:55.236 --> 18:58.134
Are you worthy of becoming the 37th?

18:58.168 --> 19:00.201
I testify that I am.

19:00.235 --> 19:01.767
Do you promise to serve

19:01.801 --> 19:04.001
our brother Kaulder in all things?

19:04.035 --> 19:08.834
To know him only as he knows himself?

19:08.868 --> 19:11.001
I promise.

19:42.037 --> 19:44.136
So you're the new guy.

19:45.403 --> 19:48.169
We've actually met before.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.736
A long time ago.

19:53.702 --> 19:56.002
You see that cornerstone?

19:57.869 --> 19:59.268
I watched them lay it in

19:59.302 --> 20:02.703
when this was nothing
more than a cornfield.

20:02.737 --> 20:05.603
That was a long time ago.

20:08.837 --> 20:12.903
I pledge my life and loyalty
to you as the 37th Dolan.

20:12.937 --> 20:15.036
I swear to help you carry
out your duty to the Order...

20:15.070 --> 20:17.202
When they were building this city,

20:17.236 --> 20:19.302
construction crews discovered

20:19.336 --> 20:23.636
a mass gravesite, 60 feet below ground,

20:23.670 --> 20:26.702
filled with thousands of forgotten slaves.

20:26.736 --> 20:28.969
Know what they did?

20:29.003 --> 20:30.735
No.

20:32.670 --> 20:33.837
Worked by night, filled the hole,

20:33.871 --> 20:35.602
and kept building.

20:36.904 --> 20:39.670
There are shades of evil everywhere.

20:45.405 --> 20:47.269
So, I'm sorting you out with

20:47.303 --> 20:49.837
fresh credit cards, new
passport, and a new identity.

20:49.871 --> 20:51.037
Just gettin' used to the old one.

20:51.071 --> 20:52.737
Well, it's out of date.

20:52.771 --> 20:55.104
There are global databases now, CCTV's,

20:55.138 --> 20:57.670
smartphones and geotracking.
The world is changing.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.670
Only on the surface.

20:59.704 --> 21:02.170
Right. But it's important
to keep a low profile.

21:02.204 --> 21:03.269
Mmm-hmm.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.837
Uh...

21:04.871 --> 21:07.403
I guess we should be thankful it's not red.

21:07.437 --> 21:09.370
May I ask where we're going?

21:09.404 --> 21:13.004
I've seen people get old, retire, and die.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.337
Rarely on the same day.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.805
He was found at his desk.

21:35.071 --> 21:37.104
What are we looking for?

21:37.138 --> 21:40.671
How do you know when there's
magic in the vicinity?

21:40.705 --> 21:42.970
A witch's magic comes from four elements,

21:43.004 --> 21:44.703
fire, water, earth and air.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.138
Applying the correct alchemical triggers

21:46.172 --> 21:48.104
will reveal its presence.

22:02.706 --> 22:04.005
No magic here.

22:04.039 --> 22:06.138
Just wanted to be sure.

22:13.805 --> 22:15.072
If the window hasn't been opened,

22:15.106 --> 22:18.739
how did that get in here?

22:18.773 --> 22:20.405
One means nothing.

22:20.439 --> 22:23.139
Two, a coincidence.

22:23.173 --> 22:26.606
Three, trouble.

22:45.173 --> 22:47.105
Get down!

22:59.172 --> 23:01.105
What?

23:03.205 --> 23:04.706
He was killed by witches.

23:04.740 --> 23:06.171
Never in the history of The Axe and Cross

23:06.205 --> 23:08.173
has a Dolan ever been murdered.

23:09.239 --> 23:10.873
You wanna quit?

23:10.907 --> 23:13.007
No.

23:13.041 --> 23:15.406
I want a raise.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.740
This is a declaration of war.

23:16.774 --> 23:18.240
Who could have done this?

23:18.274 --> 23:20.039
A concealment spell was placed

23:20.073 --> 23:21.806
to make everything look normal.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.172
They were searching for something,

23:23.206 --> 23:25.139
didn't want us to know.

23:27.141 --> 23:29.740
Elemental magic is neutral.

23:30.907 --> 23:34.307
At its root it's neither good nor evil.

23:36.906 --> 23:39.374
But this is different.

23:39.408 --> 23:41.673
This is dark magic.

23:41.707 --> 23:43.906
Beyond evil.

23:47.807 --> 23:50.139
They tied him to the chair.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.974
"Death."

24:04.008 --> 24:06.640
Is that part of the spell?

24:06.674 --> 24:10.040
You were here last night
before he died, right?

24:10.074 --> 24:12.007
Yes.

24:14.907 --> 24:17.307
Let me see your hands.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.873
Now.

24:29.207 --> 24:31.307
I was five years old

24:31.341 --> 24:33.974
when witches set our house on fire.

24:34.008 --> 24:35.675
My parents died.

24:35.709 --> 24:36.742
But you walked through the flames,

24:36.776 --> 24:38.074
wrapped me in a blanket,

24:38.108 --> 24:40.374
and jumped out the second story window.

24:40.408 --> 24:42.341
Your body broke the fall.

24:43.408 --> 24:45.841
I told you we'd met before.

24:47.909 --> 24:49.208
If you don't remember, I
can refer you to the entry...

24:49.242 --> 24:53.042
No. I remember.

24:56.441 --> 24:59.141
You hunted down the witches
and brought them to justice.

25:01.109 --> 25:04.642
I've waited my entire life for
the opportunity to help you.

25:07.976 --> 25:09.908
Well, now's your chance.

25:11.675 --> 25:14.308
You can help me hunt the
witches that did this.

25:18.208 --> 25:21.141
Shouldn't I have a gun or
an iron mallet or something?

25:22.709 --> 25:24.942
Take a deep breath. Center yourself.

25:24.976 --> 25:26.808
Right. Of course.

25:26.842 --> 25:28.643
Because resisting enchantment
requires a clear mind.

25:28.677 --> 25:30.676
Now, Max is a 14th level warlock,

25:30.710 --> 25:33.009
there's nothing you can
do. May as well relax.

25:37.309 --> 25:38.643
Free sample, Father?

25:38.677 --> 25:41.074
Oh. Thank you.

25:41.108 --> 25:43.041
I'd think twice about that.

25:49.144 --> 25:50.875
I don't know that I can do $10,000.

25:50.909 --> 25:52.208
You know the level of enchantment

25:52.242 --> 25:53.842
they are getting from that.

25:53.876 --> 25:55.076
Business is good, right?

25:55.110 --> 25:56.975
Yeah.

25:57.009 --> 25:58.143
Oh, crap.

25:58.177 --> 26:00.176
Shop's closed, Max.

26:12.876 --> 26:15.409
Kaulder. It has been too long.

26:15.443 --> 26:18.210
It is not illegal to
sell mind-altering bugs.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.310
When they're used on humans, it is.

26:20.344 --> 26:21.342
They're mixing them in the cupcakes.

26:21.376 --> 26:23.409
I hadn't noticed.

26:23.443 --> 26:25.376
Notice this?

26:27.410 --> 26:30.943
Griffin's Henbane. Very rare and forbidden.

26:30.977 --> 26:33.975
This is used in necromancy. Dark magic.

26:34.009 --> 26:37.175
You know I do not deal in
these kinds of bad things.

26:37.209 --> 26:41.142
Max, you're too smart to go down that road.

26:41.176 --> 26:44.144
One can only imagine how
many times I've been lied to.

26:44.177 --> 26:45.410
More than anyone in history, actually.

26:45.444 --> 26:47.710
Come on, Kaulder.

26:47.744 --> 26:50.143
You must understand, anyone
who would use this herb

26:50.177 --> 26:53.176
is not afraid of you. And that scares me!

26:53.210 --> 26:56.643
More than I scare you?

26:56.677 --> 26:58.743
Max.

27:01.010 --> 27:04.243
The man who came to see
me has an odor on his skin.

27:04.277 --> 27:06.310
A whiff of garlic that was not garlic.

27:06.344 --> 27:09.876
Arsenic. Anything else?

27:10.911 --> 27:13.378
And moldering crabapples.

27:15.411 --> 27:17.111
Thank you, Max.

27:17.145 --> 27:18.343
Be careful.

27:18.377 --> 27:19.378
Not in the habit.

27:19.412 --> 27:21.911
Not you. Him.

27:25.078 --> 27:28.678
So, all that made sense to you?

27:28.712 --> 27:30.678
It didn't to you?

27:30.712 --> 27:33.377
No.

27:33.411 --> 27:36.845
Arsenic was used for embalming
back in the Civil War.

27:36.879 --> 27:39.045
Whoever killed Dolan

27:39.079 --> 27:42.112
is likely living in what
was once a funeral parlor.

27:43.211 --> 27:46.012
We just have to find one
with a crabapple tree.

27:48.678 --> 27:50.645
What's that for?

27:50.679 --> 27:52.977
A cab.

27:53.011 --> 27:55.378
You're not qualified for what happens next.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.878
Oh.

27:56.912 --> 28:00.012
Right. I'll get a receipt.

28:36.279 --> 28:38.946
Whoa.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.245
Didn't your mother ever teach you

29:01.279 --> 29:03.212
not to eat candy from trees?

29:10.880 --> 29:12.813
Go home, kid.

30:00.081 --> 30:02.947
Go away.

30:02.981 --> 30:04.213
It's okay.

30:04.247 --> 30:06.180
- Get away from me.
- Shh.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.179
It's okay.

30:09.213 --> 30:11.013
Get away from me now.

30:11.047 --> 30:13.313
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Go away!

30:14.947 --> 30:16.880
It's okay.

30:23.281 --> 30:25.214
Ah...

30:27.414 --> 30:29.347
Oh, shit.

30:39.782 --> 30:41.881
You killed Dolan. Why?

30:41.915 --> 30:43.913
Who the bloody hell's Dolan? Huh?

30:43.947 --> 30:45.215
I never met the man in my life!

30:51.049 --> 30:53.749
Do you like my new pen? Huh?

31:14.281 --> 31:15.982
When I imagined my first prosecution

31:16.016 --> 31:17.182
in front of the Council,

31:17.215 --> 31:18.382
I never thought it would be

31:18.416 --> 31:20.414
for a crime against one of our own.

31:21.849 --> 31:22.848
Ellic Lemasniel.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.015
Hello, Father. Whoo!

31:25.049 --> 31:26.749
You look like a good man,

31:26.783 --> 31:29.649
tasty little thing, you. I never went...

31:30.916 --> 31:33.048
Please don't think less of me.

31:38.783 --> 31:40.882
I'll confess it later.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.883
The Witch Council receives you,

32:01.917 --> 32:04.716
37th Dolan of The Axe and Cross.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.149
The peace endures.

32:08.283 --> 32:10.316
The peace endures.

32:11.449 --> 32:13.416
I present the accused,

32:13.450 --> 32:15.282
Ellic Lemasniel, for judgment,

32:15.316 --> 32:18.415
for the murder of Dolan the 36th.

32:18.449 --> 32:20.982
I present the evidence found
in the accused's dwelling.

32:21.016 --> 32:24.149
Found? Oh, come on.

32:25.317 --> 32:28.416
What? You look like a
terrible band from the '80s.

32:30.283 --> 32:32.949
Look at your hair!

32:32.983 --> 32:34.383
He will be judged.

32:34.417 --> 32:36.149
Blah, blah, blah.

32:37.284 --> 32:38.915
You know my great-grandfather's

32:38.949 --> 32:40.683
grandfather served The Queen, huh?

32:40.717 --> 32:42.182
The Queen.

32:42.216 --> 32:43.850
You're a bureaucracy o' cowards

32:43.884 --> 32:44.882
and I don't recognize the authority

32:44.916 --> 32:46.384
here in this council.

32:46.418 --> 32:48.783
Nor do I abide by your law.

32:48.817 --> 32:53.117
The laws serve to
control and contain magic.

32:53.151 --> 32:56.183
It is only by the
operations of this council

32:56.217 --> 32:58.217
that another war does not begin.

32:58.251 --> 33:00.182
I won't lie! I'm proud of what I done!

33:00.216 --> 33:02.417
I murdered your priest!

33:02.451 --> 33:06.216
I drip-dried him like he was a stuck pig!

33:06.250 --> 33:07.282
Our priest, and my friend.

33:07.316 --> 33:09.750
Kaulder.

33:09.784 --> 33:11.784
Oh, shit. This guy again.

33:11.818 --> 33:15.783
So we're to judge him
without interrogation?

33:15.817 --> 33:18.017
Has anyone asked him
who he was workin' with?

33:21.718 --> 33:24.417
There's no Three of Pentacles card.

33:24.451 --> 33:25.650
That means he worked alone.

33:25.684 --> 33:27.817
The cards are wrong.

33:27.851 --> 33:30.284
He cast a shape-shifting spell.

33:32.318 --> 33:35.150
I haven't seen that crafted in 800 years.

33:35.184 --> 33:37.250
Not since the time of the Witch Queen.

33:37.284 --> 33:39.317
Ha! The Witch Queen is long dead.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.984
That her magic could return is impossible.

33:42.018 --> 33:43.350
- Is it impossible?
- It is.

33:43.384 --> 33:45.018
- You have the authority...
- Enough!

33:45.052 --> 33:46.283
...to turn this city inside out.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.384
For the crimes of illegal crafting...

33:47.418 --> 33:48.384
Find who he's working with.

33:48.418 --> 33:50.183
...and human sacrifice...

33:50.217 --> 33:51.184
- And I'm proud o' what I done.
- ...we sentence...

33:51.218 --> 33:52.283
...Ellic Lemasniel...

33:52.317 --> 33:53.885
I'm proud o' what I done.

33:53.919 --> 33:55.818
- ...to incarceration...
- I took a stand!

33:55.852 --> 33:57.085
...in the bedrock beneath this chamber.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.852
You are sad reflections of...

33:58.886 --> 34:00.418
Arise, Sentinel,

34:00.452 --> 34:03.919
and carry the condemned to prison.

34:15.685 --> 34:18.151
You'll never see daylight again.

34:22.119 --> 34:25.684
No, no! You may hold me now,

34:25.718 --> 34:28.619
but you'll never have us all!

34:41.153 --> 34:43.085
What is that?

34:49.319 --> 34:51.019
Hey, kid.

34:51.053 --> 34:53.019
What are you doing?

35:03.353 --> 35:05.685
Hello, Father.

35:15.087 --> 35:16.219
Still with us, old friend.

35:16.253 --> 35:17.719
He's alive?

35:17.753 --> 35:19.718
Barely.

35:19.752 --> 35:21.252
He's been cursed.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.386
How?

35:23.420 --> 35:24.754
Musca Mali.

35:24.787 --> 35:26.053
Plague fly.

35:26.087 --> 35:28.319
13th-century black magic.

35:28.353 --> 35:30.085
They were created in the
tree of the Queen, correct?

35:30.119 --> 35:32.319
That's right.

35:32.353 --> 35:34.387
Why didn't they just murder him?

35:34.421 --> 35:36.686
They wanted to interrogate him.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.753
When a Plague fly burrows inside of you,

35:38.787 --> 35:40.720
it breaks your will.

35:40.754 --> 35:42.419
Whatever the killers wanted to know,

35:42.453 --> 35:45.253
he would have told them.

35:49.453 --> 35:53.087
But the question remains,
what did they want to know?

35:53.121 --> 35:54.820
He isn't getting up.

35:54.854 --> 35:56.653
Not unless we could break the curse.

35:56.687 --> 35:57.853
And the only way to do that

35:57.887 --> 35:59.387
is to kill the witch who cast it.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.354
The one Ellic works for.

36:02.721 --> 36:05.920
Dolan's got two days, tops.

36:05.954 --> 36:08.154
Hang in there, for me.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.253
"Death."

36:26.287 --> 36:29.053
It's a message from Dolan, not the killer.

36:35.254 --> 36:36.721
"Remember your death."

36:36.755 --> 36:38.755
What does it mean?

36:40.789 --> 36:43.787
There's only one way
to remember my death...

36:43.821 --> 36:45.721
Magic.

36:49.822 --> 36:51.755
Hey, Chloe.

36:53.722 --> 36:55.655
I have one more drink here.

36:57.255 --> 36:59.754
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're good.

36:59.788 --> 37:01.355
Are we having a good night, gentlemen?

37:01.389 --> 37:03.155
Do a love shot with me, baby.

37:03.189 --> 37:05.822
Oh, no. I'm not looking for love tonight.

37:09.156 --> 37:11.022
- You guys okay?
- Yep.

37:11.056 --> 37:12.989
- Want another one?
- All right.

37:34.256 --> 37:36.921
Oh, no, come on! No, not you, too.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.756
I heard that you can't tell
before it happens. Okay?

37:38.790 --> 37:39.922
He's just standing there
all chilly calm, and then...

37:39.956 --> 37:41.288
Wham! He cuts your head off

37:41.322 --> 37:42.955
and puts it in a sack on his belt.

37:42.989 --> 37:43.956
C'mon! That's just a
story nannies tell children

37:43.990 --> 37:45.223
so they behave.

37:45.257 --> 37:48.755
Chloe, you need to leave.

37:48.789 --> 37:51.855
Miranda. Miranda!

37:58.123 --> 38:01.289
We're up to code. There are no humans here.

38:01.323 --> 38:03.355
Beautiful place.

38:03.389 --> 38:05.223
Thank you.

38:05.257 --> 38:07.856
How much do you charge?

38:07.890 --> 38:09.389
Well, that depends on what you're buying.

38:09.423 --> 38:12.156
A memory.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.190
Five hundred dollars.

38:16.056 --> 38:17.989
Deal.

38:18.023 --> 38:21.223
Did I just say "Hundred"? I...

38:21.257 --> 38:24.122
No, you know what? I actually
meant "Five thousand."

38:24.156 --> 38:25.390
Five thousand, is that what you meant?

38:25.424 --> 38:27.255
I did. I meant "Five thousand."

38:27.289 --> 38:29.223
Sold.

38:29.257 --> 38:31.190
Fifty thousand.

38:32.891 --> 38:34.890
Shall we start?

38:34.924 --> 38:36.224
No. You know what? No.

38:36.258 --> 38:39.090
I changed my mind. We're cl...

38:43.158 --> 38:45.291
Fear potion.

38:47.390 --> 38:50.357
Now, what in the world
would you be afraid of?

38:50.391 --> 38:52.756
Public speaking.

38:52.790 --> 38:53.889
You know what I'm afraid of?

38:53.923 --> 38:55.391
Enlighten me.

38:55.425 --> 38:58.190
Nothing. It's boring, really.

38:59.391 --> 39:03.324
See now, I know that you have a code.

39:03.358 --> 39:06.391
And I also know that I
haven't done anything wrong,

39:07.725 --> 39:13.056
so unless you're gonna put
a gun to my head, get out.

39:13.090 --> 39:16.957
You know, you're right. I do have a code.

39:16.991 --> 39:21.191
But I'm also not leaving.

39:23.158 --> 39:25.791
What do you want a
memory potion for, anyway?

39:25.825 --> 39:27.957
Are you hunting a witch?

39:27.991 --> 39:30.225
To help an old friend.

39:43.391 --> 39:45.858
But a word of warning to you.

39:45.892 --> 39:46.958
If you get injured in your memory,

39:46.992 --> 39:49.190
you get injured out here.

39:49.224 --> 39:51.057
Which means to say that
if you die in there,

39:51.091 --> 39:52.058
you will also die...

39:52.092 --> 39:54.658
I can't die anywhere.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.924
I have to make a
disclaimer for my insurance.

40:03.259 --> 40:05.192
Bottoms up.

40:32.026 --> 40:34.159
Say "Witch hunter."

40:34.193 --> 40:36.125
Witch hunter.

40:41.026 --> 40:42.993
Be nice.

42:42.094 --> 42:44.128
"Remember your death."

42:44.162 --> 42:47.227
What did you want me to see?

42:47.261 --> 42:50.160
Kaulder!

42:50.194 --> 42:52.328
Kaulder.

42:55.095 --> 42:57.762
Kaulder, wake up.

43:10.262 --> 43:12.895
Well, hello, witch hunter.

43:16.195 --> 43:19.261
I was yanked out of a memory spell once.

43:19.295 --> 43:21.727
My mind was scrambled eggs for hours.

43:25.329 --> 43:27.928
You know, people shouldn't
root around in their past.

43:27.962 --> 43:30.663
Some things are best left forgotten.

43:52.128 --> 43:54.062
Ah...

44:25.063 --> 44:26.664
You cursed my friend.

44:30.064 --> 44:32.062
Your friend,

44:32.096 --> 44:35.129
he lasted about five
minutes longer than most.

44:45.096 --> 44:47.129
Doesn't take much balls
to get in a bar fight

44:47.163 --> 44:49.097
when you can't get hurt.

44:54.830 --> 44:56.130
Too bad your mind isn't as tough

44:56.164 --> 44:58.097
as the rest of you.

44:59.164 --> 45:00.797
No more bar.

45:00.831 --> 45:03.365
No more memory potions for you.

45:51.166 --> 45:53.099
Breathe.

45:54.199 --> 45:55.231
Breathe.

46:16.433 --> 46:19.931
After 800 years, you've run out of time.

46:19.965 --> 46:22.798
Death is coming, witch hunter!

46:38.465 --> 46:40.765
You are the monster they say you are.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.633
Damn you! This place was all I had!

49:11.034 --> 49:12.168
Chloe!

49:12.202 --> 49:14.134
Grab my hand!

49:32.903 --> 49:34.902
Nice view.

49:51.835 --> 49:54.834
Just hold on, kid.

49:54.868 --> 49:58.068
I promise I'll find who did
this and break the curse.

49:58.102 --> 49:59.736
Kaulder! Come see this!

49:59.770 --> 50:02.303
I've got the FBI database online.

50:09.769 --> 50:10.803
Stop, go back one.

50:10.837 --> 50:11.836
Continuing.

50:11.870 --> 50:13.769
No, not him.

50:13.803 --> 50:14.902
Stop.

50:14.936 --> 50:17.236
That's him.

50:17.270 --> 50:20.102
But why doesn't he want
me to remember my death?

50:20.136 --> 50:22.669
Born Baltasar Ketola.

50:22.703 --> 50:24.270
Goes by Belial. Finnish national.

50:24.304 --> 50:27.102
He's the one Ellic was working for.

50:27.136 --> 50:30.202
The one who cursed Dolan?

50:30.236 --> 50:31.702
Every generation has to be given

50:31.736 --> 50:33.903
their chance to destroy the world.

50:33.937 --> 50:36.437
Yet most of us aren't like him, you know.

50:36.471 --> 50:39.302
We're the same as you.

50:39.336 --> 50:42.670
You may look like us, but you're not.

50:42.703 --> 50:44.970
You've got magic in your blood.

50:45.004 --> 50:47.303
Magic that can do very bad things.

50:47.337 --> 50:48.969
We were interrupted back in your bar.

50:49.003 --> 50:50.771
- Oh, yes.
- I have to try again.

50:50.805 --> 50:53.036
Yes, my bar!

50:53.070 --> 50:56.770
Where everything I cared
about burnt to the ground.

50:56.804 --> 50:59.102
But I'm not blaming you for destroying

50:59.136 --> 51:01.269
my life or anything.

51:01.303 --> 51:04.237
I'm just making an observation.

51:04.271 --> 51:08.771
An observation on how
you destroyed my life.

51:09.971 --> 51:11.337
I'm leaving.

51:11.371 --> 51:14.970
Look, I don't like it any more than you do,

51:15.004 --> 51:19.037
but if you help me, I
promise to keep you safe.

51:23.971 --> 51:25.338
I'll need more Snowdonia hawkweed

51:25.372 --> 51:27.438
to mix another memory potion.

51:27.472 --> 51:28.903
Miranda, the girl who works for me,

51:28.937 --> 51:30.138
has a pretty good stash.

51:30.172 --> 51:31.204
Um, I'll text her.

51:31.238 --> 51:33.171
Thank you.

51:34.904 --> 51:37.704
Belial had red soil on his jacket.

51:37.738 --> 51:39.071
Red soil?

51:39.105 --> 51:41.737
Analyze this and see what we get.

51:41.770 --> 51:42.936
Of course.

51:47.204 --> 51:49.137
It's Miranda.

51:50.838 --> 51:52.971
She's a cat person.

51:53.004 --> 51:55.303
Hey! Hey, there.

51:55.337 --> 51:57.772
No, I'm not dead yet.

51:57.806 --> 51:59.039
Right, so when she gets here,

51:59.073 --> 52:01.705
don't make any sudden moves, okay?

52:01.739 --> 52:03.904
Don't make eye contact.

52:03.938 --> 52:05.771
Or talk.

52:05.805 --> 52:08.039
Whoa.

52:09.072 --> 52:11.005
Sorry.

52:23.373 --> 52:25.306
This is it here.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.372
No, it hasn't sprouted yet.

52:30.406 --> 52:31.838
How many witch hunter

52:31.872 --> 52:34.071
discussion groups are you a part of?

52:34.105 --> 52:37.673
"Genocidal immortal fascist..."

52:40.206 --> 52:42.338
So that's what you
witches think of me, huh?

52:42.372 --> 52:45.372
What is it that people
know about us, anyway?

52:45.406 --> 52:47.806
That we have green skin

52:47.840 --> 52:48.872
and like to wear pointy hats,

52:48.906 --> 52:50.171
and that we're mean

52:50.205 --> 52:53.039
and got burned at the stake in Salem?

52:56.106 --> 52:58.705
Salem was wrong,

52:58.739 --> 53:01.305
and those women innocent.

53:01.339 --> 53:04.438
But what if those women
really were witches?

53:04.472 --> 53:06.838
Would it then have been okay?

53:06.872 --> 53:11.207
See, I remember thinking
if it was me found guilty,

53:12.707 --> 53:14.906
no one would care.

53:14.940 --> 53:16.873
I would.

53:25.474 --> 53:27.673
The hawkweed's gone. It's gone.

53:27.707 --> 53:29.840
I mean, someone's taken it. It's not here.

53:32.173 --> 53:34.106
Kaulder?

53:35.139 --> 53:37.306
What?

53:37.340 --> 53:40.205
- What?
- No.

53:40.239 --> 53:42.140
Miranda.

53:42.174 --> 53:43.706
Miranda!

53:52.141 --> 53:54.773
<i>You're too late, witch hunter.</i>

53:54.807 --> 53:58.439
<i>She died badly, screaming.</i>

53:58.473 --> 54:00.939
<i>Alone.</i>

54:00.973 --> 54:02.939
<i>Just like you will.</i>

54:15.175 --> 54:17.441
You're gonna get who did this, right?

54:17.475 --> 54:20.407
I'll handle Belial.

54:20.441 --> 54:22.707
Good.

54:24.709 --> 54:27.775
I don't know where else to
get the stuff that we need.

54:30.107 --> 54:32.241
There is one place.

54:35.140 --> 54:39.107
But it's old money, old
magic, and dangerous.

54:52.475 --> 54:54.407
I'm sorry.

55:14.475 --> 55:15.442
Kaulder?

55:15.476 --> 55:17.409
Sonya.

55:21.875 --> 55:23.809
Danique's been so busy,

55:23.843 --> 55:25.374
I'm surprised that she agreed to see you.

55:25.408 --> 55:26.375
I don't think she would have liked

55:26.409 --> 55:27.876
the alternative.

55:45.408 --> 55:47.908
Mr. Kaulder, you've made my night.

55:49.710 --> 55:51.676
Please have a seat.

55:53.243 --> 55:55.443
Where'd you rescue your little
friend from, a thrift shop?

55:55.476 --> 55:56.442
- Little friend...
- Oh...

56:00.209 --> 56:02.942
So tell me, what is this emergency?

56:02.976 --> 56:04.376
What is it you just must remember?

56:04.410 --> 56:07.676
He lost his car keys.

56:07.710 --> 56:09.376
How much do I owe you?

56:09.410 --> 56:11.710
Oh, nothing. You have a drink
with me. That's my price.

56:11.744 --> 56:13.842
You know what I'm here for.

56:17.176 --> 56:20.443
So many of us pretend to
be something that we're not.

56:20.477 --> 56:24.809
But you, you've lived.

56:24.843 --> 56:27.208
A man who's walked through history.

56:27.242 --> 56:30.810
To have known Napoleon, Stalin,

56:30.844 --> 56:32.743
Hitler...

56:32.777 --> 56:36.677
No need to be nostalgic.
We have enough evil now.

56:36.711 --> 56:39.877
They're not so different than you.

56:39.911 --> 56:42.310
They used their power to change the world.

56:42.343 --> 56:44.977
You can't change what you've done.

56:49.043 --> 56:51.910
Kaulder! There's something
wrong with this plant.

56:58.711 --> 56:59.676
You're here.

56:59.710 --> 57:01.644
Kaulder...

57:03.876 --> 57:05.942
Kaulder! Kaulder!

57:05.976 --> 57:07.909
- Enjoy paradise.
- Kaulder!

57:07.943 --> 57:09.876
Kaulder, it's smoke. Don't...

57:16.745 --> 57:18.711
Look, Daddy. Look!

57:18.745 --> 57:20.677
They're flying south for the winter.

57:26.445 --> 57:29.678
<i>Kaulder, listen to me.</i>

57:29.712 --> 57:32.944
<i>You are in a trap and
I need you to wake up.</i>

57:42.144 --> 57:45.177
You're not gonna find any answers here.

57:45.211 --> 57:47.911
The longer you wait, the
harder it is to get out.

57:56.911 --> 57:58.944
Kaulder. Kaulder.

57:58.978 --> 58:01.977
I need you to wake up.
None of this is real.

58:02.011 --> 58:04.044
Kaulder, you are in a trap!

58:09.345 --> 58:11.278
Come back.

58:13.446 --> 58:15.745
Kaulder, if you don't wake up right now,

58:15.779 --> 58:18.411
we are both going to die!

58:18.445 --> 58:20.445
Wake up!

58:20.479 --> 58:22.412
Chloe...

58:28.746 --> 58:32.146
This isn't real.

58:32.180 --> 58:35.879
<i>Kaulder! Wake up!</i>

58:37.312 --> 58:38.778
Pull the car into the alley

58:38.812 --> 58:40.245
and throw him in the trunk.

58:40.279 --> 58:42.112
We're going down in history

58:42.146 --> 58:44.146
as the ones who beat the witch hunter.

58:49.279 --> 58:50.879
Come on.

58:50.913 --> 58:52.845
Get out.

59:01.312 --> 59:03.680
Burial dirt.

59:03.714 --> 59:06.647
Nothing more powerful for dark magic.

59:10.412 --> 59:12.745
What does Belial want with it?

59:12.779 --> 59:14.779
Who?

59:16.046 --> 59:18.379
"Remember my death."

59:18.413 --> 59:21.647
What is it that he doesn't want me to see?

59:23.181 --> 59:26.279
Stop! Please.

59:28.979 --> 59:30.945
Belial didn't tell me anything.

59:30.979 --> 59:33.113
I helped him get the dirt.

59:33.147 --> 59:35.247
I just took a little bit for myself.

59:35.281 --> 59:38.213
He has tons of it.

59:38.247 --> 59:40.180
Please?

59:47.213 --> 59:49.313
Thanks for the drink.

59:52.046 --> 59:54.680
You are a traitor to your kind!

59:56.146 --> 59:58.747
You know what I like about thrift shops?

1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:02.214
Everything in them is old.

1:00:05.448 --> 1:00:08.014
Oh!

1:00:26.215 --> 1:00:28.314
Bitch.

1:00:37.448 --> 1:00:39.649
So now you know.

1:00:44.082 --> 1:00:46.747
You're a dream-walker.

1:00:46.781 --> 1:00:49.748
Everyone knows that
dream-walking is a black gift.

1:00:52.716 --> 1:00:56.781
I've spent my entire life
trying to hide from it.

1:00:56.815 --> 1:01:00.015
You knew I would discover your
secret, and you didn't care.

1:01:02.015 --> 1:01:04.314
You still pulled me out of that trap.

1:01:05.348 --> 1:01:08.347
It was a very brave thing to do.

1:01:08.381 --> 1:01:11.314
Lemme show you something. Come on.

1:01:12.415 --> 1:01:14.648
Good night, Max!

1:01:42.216 --> 1:01:44.415
You are a disgrace to our kind.

1:01:44.449 --> 1:01:46.848
Belial, I had no choice.

1:01:46.882 --> 1:01:49.015
Kaulder threatened to beat me
to death with his bare hands.

1:01:49.049 --> 1:01:51.149
We have plans for you, traitor.

1:01:52.983 --> 1:01:54.015
You must understand, Belial.

1:01:57.183 --> 1:01:58.916
Enjoy the shadows.

1:02:20.882 --> 1:02:25.416
This is the history of
witches. Your history.

1:02:27.250 --> 1:02:28.416
That's you.

1:02:28.450 --> 1:02:29.883
Yeah.

1:02:29.917 --> 1:02:32.283
Least they got your eyes right.

1:02:34.483 --> 1:02:36.916
These are the dream-walkers.

1:02:36.950 --> 1:02:39.417
The Witch Queen's deadliest assassins.

1:02:39.451 --> 1:02:41.249
Somehow they used to jump into your mind

1:02:41.283 --> 1:02:43.884
and pry out your most precious memories.

1:02:43.918 --> 1:02:48.051
And then they'd twist 'em
into your worst nightmares.

1:02:48.084 --> 1:02:49.315
What, you're giving a history lesson here

1:02:49.349 --> 1:02:51.150
or you're just trying to scare me?

1:02:51.184 --> 1:02:53.817
There's something no one
knows about dream-walkers.

1:02:55.085 --> 1:02:58.084
They don't need memory potions.

1:02:58.118 --> 1:03:01.284
That power lies within them.

1:03:01.317 --> 1:03:03.850
I have something buried deep in my mind

1:03:03.884 --> 1:03:05.951
that I must remember.

1:03:07.851 --> 1:03:10.917
And you're the only one that can help me.

1:03:10.951 --> 1:03:12.184
No, I can't.

1:03:12.218 --> 1:03:13.883
Chloe...

1:03:13.917 --> 1:03:15.850
No, I can't.

1:03:18.285 --> 1:03:20.151
You know, I have a younger brother,

1:03:20.185 --> 1:03:22.451
and, uh,

1:03:22.485 --> 1:03:27.216
he had this knack for just pissing me off.

1:03:27.250 --> 1:03:29.383
And one day he pushed it too far,

1:03:29.417 --> 1:03:32.684
and I somehow entered his mind.

1:03:32.718 --> 1:03:35.250
I hurt him. I didn't mean to,

1:03:35.284 --> 1:03:38.718
but I hurt him badly.

1:03:38.752 --> 1:03:40.985
So I ran away.

1:03:59.852 --> 1:04:04.285
What were their names,
your wife and daughter?

1:04:04.319 --> 1:04:06.252
Helena.

1:04:07.286 --> 1:04:09.318
Elizabeth.

1:04:12.351 --> 1:04:15.851
I haven't said their names
out loud in a long time.

1:04:20.851 --> 1:04:23.152
Kaulder, even if I wanted to help you,

1:04:23.186 --> 1:04:25.119
I wouldn't know where to begin.

1:04:28.051 --> 1:04:32.018
Think of a word that you associate with me.

1:04:32.052 --> 1:04:34.685
Could be anything.

1:04:34.719 --> 1:04:37.919
Empty everything else out of your head.

1:04:40.385 --> 1:04:43.317
And just focus on that one word.

1:04:43.351 --> 1:04:45.284
One word.

1:04:47.053 --> 1:04:49.851
If you tell me the word,
I'll focus on it, too.

1:04:49.885 --> 1:04:51.885
Sometimes that helps.

1:04:51.919 --> 1:04:53.986
What's the word?

1:04:55.719 --> 1:04:57.719
Alone.

1:05:26.986 --> 1:05:29.119
Take my hand.

1:06:05.487 --> 1:06:08.287
This way, men!

1:06:08.321 --> 1:06:10.420
Brother Dolan, look.

1:06:16.121 --> 1:06:17.853
Kaulder.

1:06:20.921 --> 1:06:23.420
What is that? Dolan?

1:06:23.454 --> 1:06:25.920
Tread with care.

1:06:25.954 --> 1:06:28.088
He did it.

1:06:31.220 --> 1:06:33.154
So ends the Queen.

1:06:36.887 --> 1:06:38.454
In the name of the Father...

1:06:38.488 --> 1:06:40.254
He's possessed!

1:06:40.288 --> 1:06:42.321
Kaulder is alive.

1:06:42.355 --> 1:06:44.255
Our nightmare ends with a miracle.

1:06:44.289 --> 1:06:46.854
Help him.

1:06:46.888 --> 1:06:48.387
Help him.

1:06:51.456 --> 1:06:53.387
It's her heart.

1:06:53.421 --> 1:06:56.455
When we destroy it, we destroy her.

1:06:56.489 --> 1:06:58.422
End it, Brother Dolan.

1:07:19.189 --> 1:07:21.188
Destroy her, Dolan!

1:07:23.823 --> 1:07:25.755
No!

1:07:31.856 --> 1:07:33.856
You kept it.

1:07:35.089 --> 1:07:38.921
It's over. The Witch Queen is dead.

1:07:43.788 --> 1:07:46.355
They betrayed you from the start.

1:07:46.389 --> 1:07:49.721
That's why they tortured your friend.

1:07:49.755 --> 1:07:52.188
Because he knew where the heart was.

1:07:52.222 --> 1:07:54.155
They're gonna bring back the Queen.

1:08:02.122 --> 1:08:03.855
For eight hundred years,

1:08:03.888 --> 1:08:05.621
we've waited for her return.

1:08:07.490 --> 1:08:09.322
You should be honored, traitor.

1:08:09.356 --> 1:08:12.423
You will be sacrificed for our cause.

1:08:16.322 --> 1:08:18.188
Kaulder, I know where
Belial brought all that dirt.

1:08:18.222 --> 1:08:20.455
The truck he rented had
a standard GPS locator...

1:08:20.489 --> 1:08:22.023
You lied to me!

1:08:22.057 --> 1:08:26.222
You saved her heart. "Remember your death."

1:08:26.256 --> 1:08:28.223
It's not what you think.

1:08:30.456 --> 1:08:32.923
You knew what it meant all
along, and you said nothing.

1:08:32.957 --> 1:08:35.090
Because I wasn't going to be responsible

1:08:35.124 --> 1:08:37.756
for the dissolution of The Axe
and Cross on my very first...

1:08:37.790 --> 1:08:39.889
They're bringing back the Queen.

1:08:42.356 --> 1:08:44.390
You don't know what you've done.

1:08:45.724 --> 1:08:48.857
I swore an oath to keep it secret.

1:08:50.024 --> 1:08:54.322
This lie has kept Apocalypse
at bay for hundreds of years.

1:08:54.356 --> 1:08:56.824
We were afraid if the
Queen's heart was destroyed,

1:08:56.857 --> 1:08:58.923
you'd lose your immortality. Or die.

1:08:58.957 --> 1:09:01.157
That wasn't your choice to make!

1:09:04.757 --> 1:09:06.691
That's what the old man thought.

1:09:09.157 --> 1:09:11.756
The night he was attacked,

1:09:11.790 --> 1:09:13.890
I think he was going to destroy it.

1:09:14.925 --> 1:09:16.858
For you.

1:09:22.423 --> 1:09:24.424
To set you free.

1:09:34.724 --> 1:09:37.391
At least The Axe and Cross
still has their weapon.

1:09:43.790 --> 1:09:45.391
You will serve the Queen...

1:09:45.425 --> 1:09:47.425
No, please.

1:09:47.459 --> 1:09:50.257
...like it or not.

1:10:02.991 --> 1:10:04.925
Ah!

1:10:17.092 --> 1:10:19.925
Go to my apartment. You'll be safe there.

1:10:19.959 --> 1:10:22.757
No, the deal was that we stick together.

1:10:22.791 --> 1:10:24.391
I'm going alone. If I can't trust

1:10:24.425 --> 1:10:26.891
my own people, how the
hell can I trust you?

1:10:29.460 --> 1:10:32.757
This isn't who you are.

1:10:32.791 --> 1:10:34.958
It's all I am.

1:11:05.193 --> 1:11:07.192
Pierce her with iron.

1:11:07.226 --> 1:11:10.459
Scour her by fire.

1:11:10.493 --> 1:11:13.159
Bring her endless death.

1:11:40.394 --> 1:11:43.959
I've missed you, Kaulder.

1:11:43.993 --> 1:11:46.793
Here's what you don't understand.

1:11:46.827 --> 1:11:49.760
What your kind never understood.

1:11:49.794 --> 1:11:52.326
I've shown mercy.

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:55.760
I could have killed every last one of you.

1:11:55.794 --> 1:11:58.325
I've done the math.

1:11:58.359 --> 1:12:00.359
I've had the time.

1:12:00.393 --> 1:12:04.194
You're different now. So confident.

1:12:04.228 --> 1:12:06.661
Maybe you shouldn't have made me immortal.

1:12:09.094 --> 1:12:11.160
Kaulder, I came to help.

1:12:11.194 --> 1:12:14.360
Chloe. I told you not to...

1:12:45.061 --> 1:12:50.094
Immortality was never yours. It was mine.

1:12:52.327 --> 1:12:53.293
You just carried it for me.

1:12:55.228 --> 1:12:57.527
Until now.

1:13:00.395 --> 1:13:04.029
I am reborn.

1:13:12.362 --> 1:13:14.295
Ah!

1:13:34.895 --> 1:13:37.861
Your race

1:13:37.895 --> 1:13:41.295
has always been frightened.

1:13:44.228 --> 1:13:47.294
Hiding in caves.

1:13:47.328 --> 1:13:49.829
Huddling around fire.

1:13:51.729 --> 1:13:53.029
Finally.

1:14:57.931 --> 1:15:01.364
Hey, kid. I was afraid I was too late.

1:15:01.398 --> 1:15:04.297
I hope I don't look as rough as you do.

1:15:05.331 --> 1:15:07.996
Okay.

1:15:10.964 --> 1:15:12.963
I killed the one who cursed you.

1:15:12.997 --> 1:15:15.430
Here.

1:15:15.464 --> 1:15:17.398
Drink this.

1:15:22.931 --> 1:15:24.865
Thank you.

1:15:27.398 --> 1:15:29.865
The Witch Queen has returned.

1:15:31.163 --> 1:15:32.963
I thought my immortality

1:15:32.997 --> 1:15:35.464
was the way that she punished me.

1:15:35.498 --> 1:15:39.296
But she just used me
to save it for herself.

1:15:39.330 --> 1:15:42.329
I'm afraid I bear some responsibility.

1:15:42.363 --> 1:15:44.397
It was hubris to think

1:15:44.431 --> 1:15:47.898
that our secret wouldn't
be discovered by the enemy.

1:15:47.932 --> 1:15:50.898
I've seen what comes next.

1:15:50.932 --> 1:15:52.998
Death.

1:15:54.498 --> 1:15:58.397
The Witch Queen will
cast another plague curse.

1:15:58.431 --> 1:16:02.365
Haven't covens with that
kind of power been destroyed?

1:16:02.399 --> 1:16:04.464
We don't destroy witches anymore.

1:16:04.498 --> 1:16:07.198
We incarcerate them.

1:16:09.832 --> 1:16:11.931
We took all the most powerful witches

1:16:11.965 --> 1:16:12.998
that ever walked the Earth

1:16:13.032 --> 1:16:15.197
and put 'em in one place.

1:16:15.231 --> 1:16:17.464
The witch prison.

1:16:17.498 --> 1:16:21.964
And they've been waiting,
waiting to be released.

1:16:21.998 --> 1:16:24.332
Waiting to exact revenge.

1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:29.432
We created the perfect coven.

1:16:31.364 --> 1:16:35.331
Now I'm right back where I started.

1:16:37.299 --> 1:16:40.331
You defeated her once.

1:16:40.365 --> 1:16:43.265
You can defeat her again.

1:16:43.299 --> 1:16:45.233
Kaulder,

1:16:46.433 --> 1:16:48.366
you must go.

1:16:50.133 --> 1:16:52.098
You have to fight.

1:17:08.933 --> 1:17:10.867
Kaulder.

1:17:16.199 --> 1:17:18.333
I never had a name for it.

1:17:20.265 --> 1:17:23.066
But my enemies came to call it "Hexenbane."

1:17:24.499 --> 1:17:26.865
Witch Slayer.

1:17:26.899 --> 1:17:28.700
I'm coming, too.

1:17:28.734 --> 1:17:31.300
Our agreement depended
on me keeping you safe.

1:17:31.334 --> 1:17:33.133
No, our agreement was that if I helped you,

1:17:33.167 --> 1:17:35.066
you'd keep me safe.

1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.332
If I get hurt now, I stay hurt.

1:17:37.366 --> 1:17:40.300
Where would that leave you?

1:17:40.334 --> 1:17:42.833
You know, I don't care!

1:17:42.867 --> 1:17:45.067
Who says that a witch can't hunt witches?

1:18:02.067 --> 1:18:04.000
Chloe.

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:07.267
Kaulder.

1:18:20.968 --> 1:18:22.867
What is this?

1:18:22.901 --> 1:18:24.933
It's a plague tree. She's here.

1:18:24.967 --> 1:18:26.367
When the spell is done,

1:18:26.401 --> 1:18:29.034
the fly swarm will be released.

1:18:29.068 --> 1:18:31.235
We haven't much time.

1:18:42.068 --> 1:18:44.001
Stay close.

1:18:51.267 --> 1:18:53.901
Kaulder, where are the prisoners?

1:19:01.935 --> 1:19:03.869
My God!

1:19:06.335 --> 1:19:08.468
Every witch I ever caught.

1:19:08.502 --> 1:19:11.069
The Queen's using their
power to release the plague.

1:19:11.103 --> 1:19:12.702
How?

1:19:12.736 --> 1:19:14.435
The chant.

1:19:14.469 --> 1:19:15.868
No witch would be strong enough

1:19:15.902 --> 1:19:17.135
to cast this spell alone.

1:19:17.169 --> 1:19:18.767
But the Witch Queen's

1:19:18.801 --> 1:19:20.435
linking their minds like a chain.

1:19:20.469 --> 1:19:22.402
So how do we stop them?

1:19:23.902 --> 1:19:26.068
Every chain has a weak link.

1:19:59.136 --> 1:20:01.168
- I'll do the honors.
- No.

1:20:01.202 --> 1:20:03.069
It's not his body we need to destroy.

1:20:03.103 --> 1:20:05.136
It's his mind.

1:20:06.969 --> 1:20:08.369
But if he dies in his dreams,

1:20:08.403 --> 1:20:10.301
the plague will be stopped.

1:20:10.335 --> 1:20:12.403
I wish there was another way.

1:20:15.937 --> 1:20:18.203
You'll still be here
when I get back, right?

1:20:20.803 --> 1:20:24.002
You're taking on the
Queen alone, aren't you?

1:20:24.036 --> 1:20:26.169
It has to end.

1:20:32.069 --> 1:20:34.736
Hey.

1:20:34.770 --> 1:20:36.503
Be careful in there.

1:20:38.103 --> 1:20:41.070
So are you worried about me then?

1:20:41.104 --> 1:20:43.804
Well, I've gotten used to you.

1:20:46.403 --> 1:20:48.002
Good hunting.

1:20:48.036 --> 1:20:50.136
You, too.

1:21:21.903 --> 1:21:23.236
The Sentinel.

1:21:23.270 --> 1:21:25.103
And it won't stop until this prisoner

1:21:25.137 --> 1:21:28.237
is put back in his cell.

1:21:34.971 --> 1:21:37.403
It's coming for Ellic.

1:22:10.438 --> 1:22:12.439
Kaulder?

1:23:30.407 --> 1:23:31.707
If there's any sign she's
getting hurt in there,

1:23:31.741 --> 1:23:33.873
you have to wake her up.

1:23:33.907 --> 1:23:35.172
And promise me you'll get her as far away

1:23:35.206 --> 1:23:36.372
from here as you can.

1:23:36.406 --> 1:23:38.340
Of course.

1:24:45.874 --> 1:24:48.674
The chanting stopped.

1:24:50.074 --> 1:24:52.207
She did it.

1:25:44.976 --> 1:25:48.309
A dream-walker shows your past.

1:25:48.343 --> 1:25:51.208
Only I can show the future.

1:25:52.509 --> 1:25:56.308
You will fail, and humanity will fall.

1:26:03.342 --> 1:26:05.109
I've taken this world back.

1:26:05.143 --> 1:26:07.076
Not yet.

1:26:12.443 --> 1:26:14.443
Can you feel it?

1:26:14.477 --> 1:26:17.142
Your mortality?

1:26:17.176 --> 1:26:20.743
Your life ebbing away?

1:26:57.511 --> 1:26:59.444
<i>Father!</i>

1:27:03.910 --> 1:27:05.376
Kaulder.

1:27:11.511 --> 1:27:13.877
<i>You are trespassers on our world.</i>

1:27:13.911 --> 1:27:15.911
<i>Father!</i>

1:27:15.945 --> 1:27:17.776
<i>I've seen it in your eyes.</i>

1:27:17.810 --> 1:27:20.877
<i>You wish for death.</i>

1:27:52.779 --> 1:27:55.911
You know the benefit of eternal life?

1:27:55.945 --> 1:27:57.911
I get to kill you twice.

1:27:59.378 --> 1:28:00.877
Stop!

1:28:00.911 --> 1:28:03.078
Kaulder!

1:28:03.112 --> 1:28:04.411
Now...

1:28:04.445 --> 1:28:05.745
- Chloe...
- I'm sorry.

1:28:05.779 --> 1:28:08.478
Release my Queen.

1:28:08.512 --> 1:28:10.977
Those witches you rescued
me from when I was a kid...

1:28:11.011 --> 1:28:14.144
They didn't kill my parents.
They were my parents.

1:28:14.178 --> 1:28:15.777
But sadly, I was born without magic.

1:28:15.811 --> 1:28:16.778
You're a witch.

1:28:16.812 --> 1:28:18.745
Yep.

1:28:20.377 --> 1:28:22.911
- No! No!
- Get back here!

1:28:24.811 --> 1:28:26.978
Get away from him! Let go!

1:28:39.879 --> 1:28:41.812
Dream-walker.

1:29:38.147 --> 1:29:39.778
Look at you,

1:29:39.812 --> 1:29:43.279
you ugly bitch of a morning.

1:29:54.981 --> 1:29:56.780
You turned against those

1:29:56.814 --> 1:29:58.313
you were charged with protecting.

1:29:58.347 --> 1:30:00.213
Yes, my Queen.

1:30:00.247 --> 1:30:03.380
Make me whole. Help me reach my destiny.

1:30:03.414 --> 1:30:05.846
Grant me the gift of magic.

1:30:05.880 --> 1:30:08.345
Clay cannot be turned to gold.

1:30:08.379 --> 1:30:12.214
Without magic, you're just a human.

1:30:39.913 --> 1:30:41.847
Father?

1:30:46.948 --> 1:30:48.981
My love.

1:30:52.514 --> 1:30:54.847
You must get up.

1:30:57.447 --> 1:31:00.049
Father, you need to get up.

1:31:01.081 --> 1:31:03.214
Save them.

1:31:09.849 --> 1:31:13.349
Go, my love. Fight.

1:31:54.448 --> 1:31:57.116
You cling to your pathetic life.

1:31:57.150 --> 1:31:59.116
And for what reason?

1:32:00.449 --> 1:32:03.215
Those closest to you betray you,

1:32:03.249 --> 1:32:06.949
and those you claim to protect
don't even know your name.

1:32:09.849 --> 1:32:11.849
By iron

1:32:13.516 --> 1:32:15.748
and fire!

1:33:16.350 --> 1:33:20.017
Try doing that with an iPad.

1:33:32.985 --> 1:33:35.450
Kaulder!

1:33:35.484 --> 1:33:37.418
Kaulder?

1:33:42.818 --> 1:33:44.883
Kaulder?

1:34:21.285 --> 1:34:23.884
As long as the Hexen heart beats,

1:34:23.918 --> 1:34:26.351
she's never truly dead.

1:34:27.985 --> 1:34:30.384
No, you can't! You'll die.

1:34:31.819 --> 1:34:33.284
I'm ready to face that reality.

1:34:33.318 --> 1:34:36.185
No! There must be another way.

1:34:36.219 --> 1:34:38.952
Listen to me.

1:34:38.986 --> 1:34:41.118
When I was pulled into the shadows,

1:34:41.152 --> 1:34:44.484
I saw that there were
things much worse than her.

1:34:44.518 --> 1:34:48.019
In the darkness. Waiting.

1:34:48.053 --> 1:34:50.318
Waiting for what?

1:34:50.352 --> 1:34:52.318
The world without you.

1:34:53.519 --> 1:34:56.819
We still need you.

1:34:56.853 --> 1:34:59.186
I need you.

1:35:03.285 --> 1:35:06.118
The Axe and Cross betrayed me.

1:35:06.152 --> 1:35:07.485
I can't trust anyone.

1:35:07.519 --> 1:35:09.720
You can trust me.

1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:15.185
800 years I've been on this road.

1:35:20.085 --> 1:35:23.285
Always hunting.

1:35:23.319 --> 1:35:26.385
- Always...
- Alone.

1:35:26.419 --> 1:35:28.886
You wouldn't be.

1:35:35.419 --> 1:35:37.985
Besides,

1:35:38.019 --> 1:35:41.286
you still owe me fifty thousand dollars.

1:35:42.452 --> 1:35:43.986
Five thousand.

1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:47.153
Oh. So we're negotiating, then?

1:35:55.386 --> 1:35:57.453
The Axe and Cross would be bothered that

1:35:57.487 --> 1:35:58.720
they're no longer in possession

1:35:58.753 --> 1:36:00.287
of the Queen's heart.

1:36:00.321 --> 1:36:03.152
I don't serve The Axe and Cross anymore.

1:36:03.186 --> 1:36:05.153
This time I do it for me.

1:36:05.187 --> 1:36:07.120
Well, it's about time.

1:36:10.153 --> 1:36:11.420
You know, I used to think

1:36:11.454 --> 1:36:14.021
the universe ran in endless circles,

1:36:14.054 --> 1:36:17.220
always repeating itself,
always predictable.

1:36:18.787 --> 1:36:20.721
And now?

1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:25.920
I don't know what happens next.

1:36:25.954 --> 1:36:29.188
Do you know what we mortals call that?

1:36:29.222 --> 1:36:31.221
Living.

1:36:36.422 --> 1:36:38.987
You know,

1:36:39.021 --> 1:36:41.953
I still need you.

1:36:41.987 --> 1:36:44.188
Well, then

1:36:44.222 --> 1:36:46.388
I'm at your service.

1:36:48.820 --> 1:36:51.354
Come on. You're not getting any younger.

1:36:54.987 --> 1:36:57.220
So you ready to go, or what?

1:36:58.955 --> 1:37:00.889
I'm driving.

1:37:04.188 --> 1:37:06.353
Okay.

1:37:29.788 --> 1:37:34.783
